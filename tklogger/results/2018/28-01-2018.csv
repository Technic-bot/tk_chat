28-01-2018T15:22:50,RedDeath2018,Hey azumachan

28-01-2018T15:23:44,Azumachan,Good.
28-01-2018T15:24:49,RedDeath2018,Anything cool happen
28-01-2018T15:26:50,Azumachan,Not yet.
28-01-2018T15:27:34,RedDeath2018,As you can see I’m not very good with conversation
28-01-2018T15:27:49,RedDeath2018,Sorry if it’s really awkward
28-01-2018T15:27:49,MidnightBlue78,"well, nothing has happened today"
28-01-2018T15:28:13,MidnightBlue78,But yesterday Tom drew the most beautiful red dress ever for Flora
28-01-2018T15:28:46,RedDeath2018,Yesterday I remember the stream
28-01-2018T15:29:01,RedDeath2018,Had to miss a whole chunk cause of my brothers
28-01-2018T15:29:19,RedDeath2018,Then when I came back on the stream ended
28-01-2018T15:29:27,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
28-01-2018T15:29:38,MidnightBlue78,i know the feeling
28-01-2018T15:29:59,MidnightBlue78,Lately i havent been able to watch the streams like i used to
28-01-2018T15:30:11,RedDeath2018,Y
28-01-2018T15:31:32,MidnightBlue78,A lot of lag
28-01-2018T15:31:44,RedDeath2018,Oh
28-01-2018T15:31:57,MidnightBlue78,"Plus, I've had things to do so i miss a lot of it"
28-01-2018T15:32:09,RedDeath2018,Ah
28-01-2018T15:33:07,RedDeath2018,Funny thing is that while I’m watching the stream somthing happens then I have to go fix it or clean it up or somthing
28-01-2018T15:33:34,RedDeath2018,So i feel you too
28-01-2018T15:34:10,MidnightBlue78,yeah...life gets in the way
28-01-2018T15:35:01,RedDeath2018,But when I do get to see the stream it’s really cool and fun
28-01-2018T15:36:40,RedDeath2018,So that’s always an upside of things
28-01-2018T15:43:14,RedDeath2018,Plus most of the time during the stream I draw so I wouldn’t talk much but it’s cool seeing a blank page into art
28-01-2018T15:43:43,RedDeath2018,Turn into art*
28-01-2018T15:44:46,MidnightBlue78,"yes, i couldn't agree more"
28-01-2018T15:45:02,RedDeath2018,Do you draw?
28-01-2018T15:46:44,MidnightBlue78,I could only wish i did
28-01-2018T15:47:06,MidnightBlue78,I only enjoy other people's art
28-01-2018T15:47:10,RedDeath2018,Lol
28-01-2018T15:47:42,RedDeath2018,I’m not the best that’s for sure but inspiration put me on a path to somewhere
28-01-2018T15:48:01,RedDeath2018,But do you have an my other hobbies
28-01-2018T15:48:34,RedDeath2018,Any not “an my”
28-01-2018T15:51:52,RedDeath2018,So do you have any other hobbies
28-01-2018T15:53:44,MidnightBlue78,"well,not really"
28-01-2018T15:54:09,MidnightBlue78,"I watch art streams, thats about it"
28-01-2018T15:54:30,MidnightBlue78,Motherhood doesn't leave me time or energy for hobbies
28-01-2018T15:55:49,RedDeath2018,Lol

28-01-2018T15:59:11,RedDeath2018,Lol
28-01-2018T16:01:45,MidnightBlue78,*sigh*  teenagers
28-01-2018T16:03:07,RedDeath2018,Thing is you have to see what they like and what you like and bond more over that
28-01-2018T16:03:31,RedDeath2018,So bond over similarities between you and the teen
28-01-2018T16:03:45,RedDeath2018,Advice from a teen to a mom
28-01-2018T16:12:02,RedDeath2018,Well IT is starting to suck
28-01-2018T16:12:16,MidnightBlue78,that is very true
28-01-2018T16:12:32,RedDeath2018,What is very true
28-01-2018T16:12:58,MidnightBlue78,the advice you gave me
28-01-2018T16:13:04,RedDeath2018,Oh
28-01-2018T16:18:42,RedDeath2018,Me and my mom bonded over MARIO cause that’s what we both like
28-01-2018T16:19:56,RedDeath2018,Though she doesn’t have time for video games anymore she still like to play MARIO on my 3ds once in awhile
28-01-2018T16:21:44,RedDeath2018,Anyone watch the pro bowl
28-01-2018T16:30:00,MidnightBlue78,My son likes that i watch anime with him
28-01-2018T16:30:29,MidnightBlue78,And my daughter likes when i watch her play the bass guitar
28-01-2018T16:33:01,RedDeath2018,Well then they like to show you what they like and if you like it then it’s going to last a long time
28-01-2018T16:33:43,RedDeath2018,My mom used to like to see me playing the piano cause that’s what she likes to do
28-01-2018T16:34:18,TheBeckoner,I haven't been able to consistently whatcha stream im a while now...Hopefully I get all of wednesdays in.

28-01-2018T23:14:08,Twokinds,"Do any of you guys use these newfangled comic websites, like tapastic or webtoons, or whatever? What do you think of those."
28-01-2018T23:14:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't use them
28-01-2018T23:14:27,Bgrmystr2,"I do, and they're ok"
28-01-2018T23:14:28,Ordithus,I've used tapastic.  It's alright.
28-01-2018T23:14:33,Bgrmystr2,I read several comics on both
28-01-2018T23:14:35,wolfspartan1,i don't use them
28-01-2018T23:14:36,MviluUatusun,I follow a couple of comics on taptastic.
28-01-2018T23:14:39,KawaiiFlora,i like taptastic
28-01-2018T23:14:41,BluePhantom90,hmm never heard of them
28-01-2018T23:14:43,CrRAR,"Mark me down for ""I don't even know what those are"" XD"
28-01-2018T23:14:45,Tharkis,"i know one person who uses webtoons, i dont use any of them except to read my friend's comic on webtoons"
28-01-2018T23:14:47,Bgrmystr2,"they're not bad, but I dunno."
28-01-2018T23:15:06,Dadrobit,"Nope, I know a couple that are on them, but I don't use it even for them."
28-01-2018T23:15:23,KiTA,reminds me of that meme drawing of a touhou character looking all happy
28-01-2018T23:15:42,Bgrmystr2,"Imo, webtoons has a lot of wasted space on the website"
28-01-2018T23:15:45,JaydenMozingo,I don't personaly know what they are but I have a friend who uses webtoons I think
28-01-2018T23:15:51,Bgrmystr2,lol which one Kita
28-01-2018T23:15:53,Ordithus,Tapastic's endless scrolling is worse than Netflix's autoplay.
28-01-2018T23:16:03,TheBeckoner,Never even heard of those Tom.
28-01-2018T23:16:12,MviluUatusun,One I follow is Cross Time Cafe.
28-01-2018T23:16:28,Twokinds,That's on there now?
28-01-2018T23:16:28,MviluUatusun,"Well, one of the CTCs."
28-01-2018T23:17:11,Tharkis,for pizza you need a pizza stone P
28-01-2018T23:17:15,Tharkis,xtell
28-01-2018T23:17:19,JaydenMozingo,"Tom, you may not be looking specifically at my chat messages, but I used yo draw, nowhere nearly as good as you though, your art inspired me man"
28-01-2018T23:17:30,MviluUatusun,CTC Annex is.  White_Pony got upset with them and moved the others to another server.
28-01-2018T23:18:40,KawaiiFlora,"ye, same Jayden. I didnt even know that people got this fast at doing it after any amount of practice"
28-01-2018T23:18:58,TheBeckoner,Tom'sa fast boi
28-01-2018T23:19:07,CrRAR,mmm
28-01-2018T23:19:28,CrRAR,lightning-speed Flora
28-01-2018T23:19:29,JaydenMozingo,"To where i went to the extent of getting a Ugee 1910B (different software though) just so that I could draw like this. I'm still getting used to it though. But If my friend never told me about Twokinds, I wouldn't be the me here today"
28-01-2018T23:19:30,TheBeckoner,At Least as fast as Bgr to a keyboard.
28-01-2018T23:19:34,TheBeckoner,but with art
28-01-2018T23:20:06,MviluUatusun,I don't even remember how I found out about TwoKinds.
28-01-2018T23:20:10,Bgrmystr2,xD Beck
28-01-2018T23:20:14,w0lfmare,"From my experience, Tapastic didn't seem to have a lot of following"
28-01-2018T23:20:36,TheBeckoner,I think I got here from ifunny when I found a dude posting the pages there.
28-01-2018T23:20:47,RedDeath2018,Why did no one tell me there was a stream today!!!!
28-01-2018T23:20:50,BadFoMo,What's Tapastic?
28-01-2018T23:20:52,MviluUatusun,White_Pony got upset with them when they changed there Terms of Use.
28-01-2018T23:20:55,TheBeckoner,I stopped in 2012 an re-read not too long ago
28-01-2018T23:20:59,Twokinds,Yeah I was just wondering what the kids are using these days
28-01-2018T23:21:02,Twokinds,XD
28-01-2018T23:21:08,TheBeckoner,Tomisoldman
28-01-2018T23:21:09,KawaiiFlora,"well, their popular comic has 148k views"
28-01-2018T23:21:20,Tharkis,i keep looking for my 'webring' bars at the bottom of comic pages
28-01-2018T23:21:24,RedDeath2018,What is going on
28-01-2018T23:21:27,Tharkis,shakes a cane at everyone 'get off mah lawn!'
28-01-2018T23:21:29,w0lfmare,"And much like Smackjeeves and other sites like it, most of the Tapastic users were directed towards their top 5 most popular comics"
28-01-2018T23:21:32,TheBeckoner,"Chat,Red."
28-01-2018T23:21:36,RedDeath2018,Hi
28-01-2018T23:21:43,Bgrmystr2,I think both Tapastic and webtoons waste a bunch of space on the sides of their page.
28-01-2018T23:21:43,TheBeckoner,Hi.
28-01-2018T23:21:45,MviluUatusun,"That should be me, Tharkis.  I'm the old guy here."
28-01-2018T23:21:49,JaydenMozingo,I still have a lot of trouble with the eyes though... lol.
28-01-2018T23:21:54,ZahnHolley,Hi
28-01-2018T23:21:59,BluePhantom90,Who are you calling a Kid @Twokinds?
28-01-2018T23:21:59,RedDeath2018,I didn’t know there was a stream today so now I’m confused
28-01-2018T23:22:09,Twokinds,"It's so much easier these days to get yourself out there. But being so easy, it's also a lot harder to get noticed with so much."
28-01-2018T23:22:10,CrRAR,It just happens~
28-01-2018T23:22:11,Sammit,HI Zahn and RedDeath
28-01-2018T23:22:19,CrRAR,yeah
28-01-2018T23:22:21,BadFoMo,I remember Smackjeeves.
28-01-2018T23:22:29,Zakuru,EYYYY
28-01-2018T23:22:32,Zakuru,my song
28-01-2018T23:22:34,TheBeckoner,I don't think you have a publicity issue Tom. ^-^
28-01-2018T23:22:38,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
28-01-2018T23:22:42,MviluUatusun,"I think Smackjeeves is still around, FoMo."
28-01-2018T23:22:43,TheBeckoner,Not like other people
28-01-2018T23:22:46,Bgrmystr2,I like how tapastic has the archive on the left
28-01-2018T23:22:52,Bgrmystr2,you can just pick what chapter you want to start at
28-01-2018T23:22:53,ZahnHolley,Revolution is ended...
28-01-2018T23:22:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-flomad::ctwokinds-floAAA::ctwokinds-flomad:
28-01-2018T23:22:58,TheBeckoner,W O A
28-01-2018T23:23:03,Bgrmystr2,xDD
28-01-2018T23:23:07,Twokinds,Yeah I do like tapastic's format
28-01-2018T23:23:09,w0lfmare,"Yeah, I'm surprised that this is coming from you Tom XD"
28-01-2018T23:23:12,KiTA,1.  Flora always looks 100x more lewd without her stripes
28-01-2018T23:23:14,Twokinds,It's very easy to read a comic
28-01-2018T23:23:20,KiTA,2.  That hand placement without context isn't helping
28-01-2018T23:23:27,JaydenMozingo,She does
28-01-2018T23:23:28,Tharkis,a lot of those sites have exclusivity things though
28-01-2018T23:23:28,Ordithus,lol
28-01-2018T23:23:28,TheBeckoner,If I find a person who shares interests like Tk I generally try to get them to read it.
28-01-2018T23:23:32,JaydenMozingo,XD
28-01-2018T23:23:47,Tharkis,"i.e. if you have your comic on webtoons, i think they'll kick you off webtoons if you post it anywhere else / your own webstie / etc"
28-01-2018T23:23:56,Ordithus,"She's always naked, but it's like she's... extra naked."
28-01-2018T23:23:58,KawaiiFlora,sheesh
28-01-2018T23:23:59,Tharkis,think taptastic has the same
28-01-2018T23:24:04,CrRAR,I just think that hand is half-way to paw mode XD
28-01-2018T23:24:11,TheBeckoner,&gt;Advanced naked
28-01-2018T23:24:23,ZahnHolley,Shes coverd in fur.
28-01-2018T23:24:27,Tharkis,without her stripes = extra naked?
28-01-2018T23:24:28,Tharkis,=P
28-01-2018T23:24:31,TheBeckoner,Yes.
28-01-2018T23:24:34,w0lfmare,I think those sites are more for people just starting out
28-01-2018T23:24:50,KawaiiFlora,i found this comic off of youtube
28-01-2018T23:24:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, it's getting late.  So I wish everyone goodnight!"
28-01-2018T23:24:54,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, I think the same w0lf"
28-01-2018T23:25:00,CrRAR,bye palm
28-01-2018T23:25:00,w0lfmare,"Eventually, you want your own site with your own customization"

28-01-2018T23:25:26,Ordithus,"ew, doritos"
28-01-2018T23:25:32,CrRAR,esp being one color rn
28-01-2018T23:25:34,Bgrmystr2,"I think, Tom, that the side panel with easy access to chapters is a great thing, you could potentially use that on your site if you wanted"
28-01-2018T23:25:53,TheBeckoner,I believe this is a younger Flora no? So it makes sense she looks this way.
28-01-2018T23:25:55,MviluUatusun,"It's always fun to watch Tom draw but, unfortunately, he stays up too late for this old man.  Y'all take care until the next time I see ya."

28-01-2018T23:28:40,JaydenMozingo,"When I draw, I get the hair in the wrong shape/angle"
28-01-2018T23:28:58,Twokinds,Getting it wrong is the first step to getting it right
28-01-2018T23:29:04,KawaiiFlora,I cant get the hair to work right with ears

28-01-2018T23:45:04,Bgrmystr2,"that seems like a lot of stuff going on, Tom.. for 42 layers"
28-01-2018T23:45:25,TheBeckoner,brb
28-01-2018T23:45:54,KawaiiFlora,the layers just make things a lot faster but you dont want to put too much then its slower again lol
28-01-2018T23:45:58,Bgrmystr2,I wonder how many layers the image of King Madness with the magic table would have been.... :ptv-wondering:
28-01-2018T23:46:01,Dadrobit,"Maybe, but I ~am~ the one who likes to read other people stories to help them sleep!"
28-01-2018T23:46:08,Bgrmystr2,that thing was insane

28-01-2018T23:46:30,Dadrobit,cracks open 50 Shades of Grey
28-01-2018T23:46:56,JaydenMozingo,so when do you use the layers besides the background and after the pre-sketch Tom?
28-01-2018T23:46:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,story time with dad :)
28-01-2018T23:47:03,RedDeath2018,All this layer talk seems confusing I’m just gonna stick to paper

28-01-2018T23:47:41,Bgrmystr2,the colors and line art are probably separate layers as well
28-01-2018T23:47:53,qwe304,I have no clue how
28-01-2018T23:47:56,JaydenMozingo,hmm...

28-01-2018T23:48:40,RedDeath2018,Shading sucks
28-01-2018T23:48:42,Bgrmystr2,"ah yeah, the colors are multiple layers"

28-01-2018T23:53:34,Ordithus,Krita is more geared for drawing.  Photoshop is meant for photo manipulation!
28-01-2018T23:53:35,Dadrobit,It's all about workflow Jay. Use what you are best on.
28-01-2018T23:53:41,Bgrmystr2,"Is it updated though, Beck?"
