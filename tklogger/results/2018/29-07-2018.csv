29-07-2018T00:05:27,Twokinds,It's been a very Reni july
29-07-2018T00:05:29,Twokinds,Apparently
29-07-2018T00:05:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the 4th did happen
29-07-2018T00:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And she’s a dragon

29-07-2018T00:06:06,unsteddyphoenix,Twist she's scared of fireworks
29-07-2018T00:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,*would do if given fireworks
29-07-2018T00:06:16,unsteddyphoenix,And hides under the bed like a cat
29-07-2018T00:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see that
29-07-2018T00:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,“No smoking near fireworks shop” “Excuse me but I feel that’s discriminatory. I’m perfectly in control of my flames...ahhh..aachooo”
29-07-2018T00:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,And there goes half the town

29-07-2018T00:16:10,SpazztasticKiwi,“Free shavakado”
29-07-2018T00:16:22,unsteddyphoenix,there was a bloodmoon?
29-07-2018T00:16:38,SpazztasticKiwi,The 27 & 28
29-07-2018T00:16:46,Twokinds,THE BLOODMOON
29-07-2018T00:16:51,Twokinds,On my birthday
29-07-2018T00:16:53,Twokinds,It is a sign!
29-07-2018T00:17:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw it Saturday when I drove home
29-07-2018T00:17:07,unsteddyphoenix,!!
29-07-2018T00:17:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but is it a good sign that a BLOOD moon happened
29-07-2018T00:18:03,unsteddyphoenix,"To someone, surely"
29-07-2018T00:18:32,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe it'll curse Tom's enemies since it was on his birthday!
29-07-2018T00:18:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It was pretty. I remember learning about it and thought it’d be nice to go out to the park or something and find a good view and watch it morph
29-07-2018T00:18:54,SpazztasticKiwi,But I had to work and it’s not as much fun alone
29-07-2018T00:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,How’d you not know? It’s been all over social media and most of the news
29-07-2018T00:21:42,unsteddyphoenix,hmm
29-07-2018T00:21:51,SpazztasticKiwi,“Prepare! It’s a blood moon!” Like it was an omen of death
29-07-2018T00:21:58,unsteddyphoenix,Must've missed it somehow
29-07-2018T00:22:02,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe it wasnt visible here?
29-07-2018T00:22:06,unsteddyphoenix,Dunno
29-07-2018T00:22:22,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s pictures of it over Greece
29-07-2018T00:23:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Like Poseidon’s Temple
29-07-2018T00:24:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I also like Greece so it could be from a blood moon in the past and came across my feed cause it was Greek artistic architecture
29-07-2018T00:25:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I have an art degree. Fat lot of good it does me but I studied some old fancy stuff
29-07-2018T00:26:27,unsteddyphoenix,Dude I love European architecture
29-07-2018T00:26:36,unsteddyphoenix,Everytime I visit the fam in Italy
29-07-2018T00:26:43,unsteddyphoenix,The buildings blow me away
29-07-2018T00:28:00,unsteddyphoenix,Even the like...design of the streets I love
29-07-2018T00:29:24,BadFoMo,Did I miss anything while I was gone??
29-07-2018T00:33:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone dropped their Reni collection
29-07-2018T00:34:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Nobody knew of the blood moon on Tom’s birthday
29-07-2018T00:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,As far as I know that’s it
29-07-2018T00:40:51,BadFoMo,Reni collection?
29-07-2018T00:43:48,SpazztasticKiwi,There was Renis everywhere

29-07-2018T01:06:34,unsteddyphoenix,I'll come willingly
29-07-2018T01:07:08,iliar,"About Reni. Will be very interesting seen what does the Reni's house look like. I mean, in the TK world, dragons do not live in caves. But ordinary human houses are not convenient for dragons."
29-07-2018T01:07:45,unsteddyphoenix,Wasnt it established that the nobility accomidates their houses for dragons
29-07-2018T01:07:57,unsteddyphoenix,'cause it's ~fasionable~
29-07-2018T01:09:58,iliar,"Adapt, yes. Make the ceilings higher and the doorways are larger."
29-07-2018T01:10:38,unsteddyphoenix,So theyre used to designing dragon-sized houses~
29-07-2018T01:14:17,iliar,"For some reason, it seems to me that if a dragon does a house for himself, he will do it a little differently, than just resize an ordinary human house."
29-07-2018T01:15:02,iliar,Although...
29-07-2018T01:15:17,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like Reni specifically might do that
29-07-2018T01:15:26,iliar,Probably I'm wrong.
29-07-2018T01:15:44,Twokinds,Reni lives in the place at the capital.
29-07-2018T01:17:12,iliar,In TDM we seen Nora's house. It's looks like as ordinary human house.
29-07-2018T01:17:27,unsteddyphoenix,oh that place
29-07-2018T01:17:51,Twokinds,sorry
29-07-2018T01:17:55,Twokinds,I mean palace
29-07-2018T01:18:16,unsteddyphoenix,Ohh~
29-07-2018T01:18:24,unsteddyphoenix,I thought you were joking lol
29-07-2018T01:18:37,unsteddyphoenix,I suppose that's appropriate for a princess
29-07-2018T01:19:35,iliar,But Reni is not exactly a princess
29-07-2018T01:19:39,Twokinds,"Yeah, she's considered part of the royal family."
29-07-2018T01:20:12,iliar,Really?
29-07-2018T01:20:48,Twokinds,Mmhm
29-07-2018T01:21:06,iliar,"I thought ""princess"" is just a sobriquet."
29-07-2018T01:21:09,unsteddyphoenix,"If a tragic accident were to befall her ""siblings"""
29-07-2018T01:21:17,unsteddyphoenix,Could she potentially take the throne? :thinking:
29-07-2018T01:21:50,unsteddyphoenix,presuming she's not already first in line~
29-07-2018T01:22:08,Twokinds,Probably... not. The royal family kinda... use her. Having a dragon is very prestigous.
29-07-2018T01:22:34,unsteddyphoenix,Tch. I mean I kinda figured it was like that
29-07-2018T01:22:39,unsteddyphoenix,But I HOPED.
29-07-2018T01:23:12,Twokinds,But she doesn't really have royal athority. It's a mostly empty title.
29-07-2018T01:23:35,Twokinds,"Humans don't like the idea of being ruled by something not human, to be frank."
29-07-2018T01:23:47,unsteddyphoenix,So she's like
29-07-2018T01:23:55,unsteddyphoenix,A mascot!
29-07-2018T01:24:03,Twokinds,Yeah
29-07-2018T01:24:09,Twokinds,"I mean they like dragons, because dragons are powerful."
29-07-2018T01:24:17,Twokinds,So they're happy putting her on their flags and stuff.
29-07-2018T01:24:23,Twokinds,Making the human symbol a dragon.
29-07-2018T01:25:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Plus maybe that'll please the dragons, making them more eager to work with humans?"
29-07-2018T01:25:38,unsteddyphoenix,Or something like that...
29-07-2018T01:25:51,Twokinds,There are isolated human colonies ruled by a dragon. But that's because human settlers moved to an island owned by a dragon first.
29-07-2018T01:26:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Are those the dragon cultists, or are they something else"
29-07-2018T01:26:48,Twokinds,Nah
29-07-2018T01:27:02,Twokinds,Just regular settlers.
29-07-2018T01:27:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Does the dragon do any actual ""ruling""? Or does it just...tolerate them"
29-07-2018T01:28:27,iliar,They might want to have a human ruler. But the dragon hinted that with ketchup and mayonnaise they can be quite edible.
29-07-2018T01:28:31,unsteddyphoenix,This is the type of lore I really want to explore~
29-07-2018T01:28:48,Twokinds,They pay a tithe to live there. The dragon tax.
29-07-2018T01:29:50,unsteddyphoenix,"""Sure, we can have an election. I'll count the votes so i'll know who didnt vote for me."""
29-07-2018T01:30:00,Twokinds,Haha XD
29-07-2018T01:30:46,unsteddyphoenix,"The island must be somewhat prosperous for people to be able to pay a ""life tax"""
29-07-2018T01:31:29,Twokinds,Well the dragon keeps pretty much any other monster or outside group from threatening them.
29-07-2018T01:31:34,Twokinds,Just by being there.
29-07-2018T01:32:22,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
29-07-2018T01:32:28,goldgardian,"a sort of ""I have an army"" ""We have a dragon"" scenario?"
29-07-2018T01:32:45,unsteddyphoenix,"I guess if there's any...""empire tax"" that island wouldnt bother paying that."
29-07-2018T01:32:50,goldgardian,(Sorry if I'm interrupting)
29-07-2018T01:33:21,unsteddyphoenix,It's a public chat fam :)
29-07-2018T01:33:29,Twokinds,Yeah they're not connected with the rest of the human empire
29-07-2018T01:33:44,Twokinds,Probably in a few hundred years they'll turn into their own citystate and then country.
29-07-2018T01:34:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Lmao, yesss~"
29-07-2018T01:34:27,unsteddyphoenix,I love it
29-07-2018T01:34:37,unsteddyphoenix,Like that one human villiage inside keidran territory?
29-07-2018T01:34:51,Twokinds,Yeah
29-07-2018T01:36:00,goldgardian,So.. question do dragon/human children have special magic or powers or whatnot?
29-07-2018T01:36:16,Twokinds,"No, not really."
29-07-2018T01:36:29,goldgardian,they just normal humans with bragging rights?
29-07-2018T01:36:34,unsteddyphoenix,Is there like...a higher chance of them having magical potential at all?
29-07-2018T01:36:37,Twokinds,"No, they're just always dragons."
29-07-2018T01:36:43,Twokinds,Dragons always make dragons.
29-07-2018T01:36:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Ohh, duh."
29-07-2018T01:37:30,goldgardian,"So, dragon takes human form, has kids with human, and the human mom lays an egg?"
29-07-2018T01:37:58,Twokinds,The specifics of how it works are a mystery...
29-07-2018T01:38:03,goldgardian,good answer.

29-07-2018T01:38:15,unsteddyphoenix,I assumed they made a dragon that was in human form

29-07-2018T01:51:20,goldgardian,So lizardfolk are cannon?
29-07-2018T01:51:30,Twokinds,"Which is a little funny, because Lizardfolk in the Twokinds world aren't as intellegent as Keidran or Humans."
29-07-2018T01:51:43,Twokinds,"So, it kinda doesn't know what's going on."
29-07-2018T01:51:52,unsteddyphoenix,Lol d'aw
29-07-2018T01:52:01,unsteddyphoenix,The most stressed lizard in the realm
29-07-2018T01:52:06,Dadrobit,"Such Dragon, much fire. Wow."
29-07-2018T01:52:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know how I got here but I think I’m stuck
29-07-2018T01:52:26,Twokinds,"I mean, he rolls with it."
29-07-2018T01:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,“I may look proper but I assure you I have no idea what the hell I’m doing”
29-07-2018T01:53:34,Dadrobit,Story of my career tbh
29-07-2018T01:53:38,goldgardian,"Off topic... is Clovis still affected by Nora's curse, or is that spoilers?"
29-07-2018T01:53:49,Twokinds,Sssh
29-07-2018T01:53:51,Twokinds,Spoilers
29-07-2018T01:54:02,unsteddyphoenix,shhhhsh
29-07-2018T01:54:10,goldgardian,I  am the shush
29-07-2018T01:54:29,unsteddyphoenix,"There are ""cat tribes"" right? Why do we never see any slaves from there."
29-07-2018T01:54:38,unsteddyphoenix,Do tigers not slavetrade?
29-07-2018T01:55:14,iliar,"Okay, I understand about ""true dragons"" and ""non-pure"". But who is born of the two non-pure dragons? It will be ""true dragon"" or not?"
29-07-2018T01:55:53,Twokinds,Uh... I hadn't thought of that.
29-07-2018T01:56:07,Twokinds,I don't know!
29-07-2018T01:56:07,unsteddyphoenix,lol a negative x a negative makes a positive
29-07-2018T01:56:13,Twokinds,Yes
29-07-2018T01:56:14,Twokinds,Sure
29-07-2018T01:56:15,unsteddyphoenix,It rolls back around to pure
29-07-2018T01:56:26,Twokinds,Tigers don't trade slaves.
29-07-2018T01:56:30,SpazztasticKiwi,As much as this is invigorating I’m gonna be late for my date
29-07-2018T01:56:37,unsteddyphoenix,Ah gotcha
29-07-2018T01:56:40,Twokinds,And the cat tribe are completely buffered by the tigers.
29-07-2018T01:56:51,Dadrobit,"o/ Spazz, enjoy"
29-07-2018T01:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,🛏
29-07-2018T01:57:09,Twokinds,"Most humans haven't seen one, though they do exist outside of their territory in tiny numbers."
29-07-2018T01:57:12,Twokinds,G'night!
29-07-2018T01:57:28,goldgardian,"Wait, are they little? like hobbits?"
29-07-2018T01:57:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, that makes sense"
29-07-2018T01:58:16,Twokinds,"They are basically slightly larger, upright housecats. Ala monster hunter."
29-07-2018T01:58:17,iliar,Is there any racial intolerance between pure and non-pure dragons?
29-07-2018T01:58:32,unsteddyphoenix,Thats amazing~
29-07-2018T01:58:47,Twokinds,Oh yes
29-07-2018T01:58:50,Twokinds,Quite a lot
29-07-2018T01:59:04,goldgardian,I mean.. Reni said herself that other dragon don't like her
29-07-2018T01:59:09,unsteddyphoenix,Hype for monster hunter pc
29-07-2018T02:00:01,unsteddyphoenix,"No theres no ""keidran"" cat types? Like the black cat that maren was?"
29-07-2018T02:00:28,MrEase,random 3:00 AM loredump?
29-07-2018T02:00:34,MrEase,XD
29-07-2018T02:00:40,ZRO4825,I'm okay with this~
29-07-2018T02:01:02,MrEase,me too
29-07-2018T02:01:20,iliar,10 am and probably I'll be late for work)
29-07-2018T02:01:37,Twokinds,Don't be late!
29-07-2018T02:02:03,MrEase,lore can always be screencapped and catalogued
29-07-2018T02:02:09,MrEase,work can't be
29-07-2018T02:03:14,BadFoMo,I too am ok with Lore dumps (that I can catch).
29-07-2018T02:03:50,iliar,Yeah... catalogued... Its reason why a always record all chat logs.
29-07-2018T02:04:09,unsteddyphoenix,...huh
29-07-2018T02:04:16,BadFoMo,You do?
29-07-2018T02:04:17,goldgardian,"I'm curious about magic... what's flat out not possible, aside from Resurrection? like, are undead not a thing?"
29-07-2018T02:04:57,BadFoMo,...Can I get in on this Chat Logging thing too?
29-07-2018T02:05:50,iliar,https://yadi.sk/d/IWy-YbBU3TkBpY
29-07-2018T02:07:07,iliar,But I have no time to read all logs(
29-07-2018T02:07:10,goldgardian,geeze... that's a lot of pressure for an author... you guys are literally catoloauging everything he says on the chat...
29-07-2018T02:07:20,QuinnAuer,"huh, cool ilar"
29-07-2018T02:07:30,QuinnAuer,Iliar* sorry
29-07-2018T02:08:14,Twokinds,"Well, I always say, everythign is canon - until it's contradicted in the comic."
29-07-2018T02:08:35,BadFoMo,Would just adding that to 'favorits' work?
29-07-2018T02:08:49,iliar,"Well, at least ""ilar"" is better than ""liar"""
29-07-2018T02:09:02,QuinnAuer,D:
29-07-2018T02:09:15,Twokinds,Impossible? Well... lots of things.
29-07-2018T02:09:15,ZRO4825,"lol, good point, Tom"
29-07-2018T02:09:20,BadFoMo,"Also, I am ok with that methid, Tom."
29-07-2018T02:09:40,Twokinds,"Magic still needs knowledge, in Twokinds. So, curing infection through magic is impossible until mages know what causes infection."
29-07-2018T02:10:32,goldgardian,"So.. if you knew how the body works, you could animate a dead one with say.. lighting or something, A-la Frankestien's monster?"
29-07-2018T02:10:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, alright ill take it~"
29-07-2018T02:11:24,iliar,"I think the main problem is "" if you knew how the body works"""
29-07-2018T02:11:33,goldgardian,"I personally like that idea. Magic being limited by your knowledge of the natural world, and your mana"
29-07-2018T02:12:59,iliar,If you received Frankestien's monster it's means you don't know how body works.
29-07-2018T02:13:03,unsteddyphoenix,They havent gotten to the point where they know their limits
29-07-2018T02:13:07,Twokinds,A lot of magic is just limited by creativity. The rest is just the energy required to do it.
29-07-2018T02:13:47,goldgardian,Creativity + knowledge + mana = magic?
29-07-2018T02:13:49,MrEase,so Trace's magical proficiency was just due to being born with a higher than normal capacity for magical energy?
29-07-2018T02:14:03,iliar,I think it will be fair if the creation of life will require a lot of energy.
29-07-2018T02:14:07,MrEase,and being creative (before amnesia)
29-07-2018T02:14:36,Bgrmystr2,Wouldn't you be able to use magic to help find a better way to study magic.. like a stepping stool to learn more about the thing helping you learn about that thing in the first place?
29-07-2018T02:14:51,unsteddyphoenix,"And he increased with dark magic abuse, i somehow remember"
29-07-2018T02:14:57,Twokinds,"Yeah, he had a bigger well to draw from, especiaally after trying to resurrect Saria."
29-07-2018T02:16:04,goldgardian,"So the more you use Dark magic, the more mana you have to draw from?"
29-07-2018T02:16:13,Twokinds,Yup
29-07-2018T02:16:21,iliar,This means that you can technically create or prolong life with the help of magic. But you can not do it because you do not have enough energy.
29-07-2018T02:16:43,goldgardian,Couldn't you in theory use all the templar towers?
29-07-2018T02:16:44,unsteddyphoenix,"More mana, but its more fragile"
29-07-2018T02:17:06,Twokinds,True but there's a little to how much you can draw. Drawing is a lot slower than using your own reserves.
29-07-2018T02:17:18,Twokinds,limit*
29-07-2018T02:17:54,MrEase,"And Red's lack of magical ability, was just being born with a shallow well of magic and no creativity other than ""make things go boom"""
29-07-2018T02:17:59,MrEase,Makes total sense
29-07-2018T02:18:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Sit there for 100 years, powering up"
29-07-2018T02:18:08,Twokinds,Mana reserve is like a waterballoon. Black magic is like filling the waterballoon with acid that weakens the rubber so it gets bigger.
29-07-2018T02:18:18,Twokinds,Until it pops.
29-07-2018T02:18:41,unsteddyphoenix,I actually remeber that analogy
29-07-2018T02:18:48,unsteddyphoenix,From ages ago
29-07-2018T02:18:50,BadFoMo,As do I.
29-07-2018T02:19:01,goldgardian,"I mean... for all we know Red has a metric buttload of mana, and zero creativity"
29-07-2018T02:19:12,unsteddyphoenix,...i dont know how
29-07-2018T02:19:14,Twokinds,lol reds just bad at both
29-07-2018T02:19:28,MrEase,Also random question did Red know Trace as a kid or did he only know him as an adult/young adult?
29-07-2018T02:19:56,Twokinds,"Well, Trace went to the Templar school as a kid"
29-07-2018T02:20:00,Twokinds,And they met there
29-07-2018T02:20:29,MrEase,"because that would suck to just be this magically inept kid, and your best friend is just OP"
29-07-2018T02:21:29,unsteddyphoenix,How did they even become friends
29-07-2018T02:21:36,unsteddyphoenix,Seems like an oddcouple
29-07-2018T02:22:43,Dadrobit,They both shared a deep hatred for Keidran
29-07-2018T02:22:44,MrEase,Or was it just Red following him around and saying he's his friend but Trace didn't see him that way?
29-07-2018T02:23:00,BadFoMo,I think I have a dumb question. Thoes Transformation Collars; is the transfromation phisical or an ilusion?
29-07-2018T02:23:17,Twokinds,Uh... I don't know.
29-07-2018T02:23:19,Twokinds,To both questions.
29-07-2018T02:23:24,MrEase,Its non canon magic
29-07-2018T02:23:29,MrEase,the most powerful magic of all
29-07-2018T02:23:30,BadFoMo,Ok.
29-07-2018T02:23:31,goldgardian,Patneted Nora magic.
29-07-2018T02:23:44,FenceEqualizer,Maybe Trace had a love for random explosions 💥
29-07-2018T02:26:46,BadFoMo,...Has Nora done anything other than Transfromation and/or Transgender?
29-07-2018T02:27:09,Twokinds,"Uh, probably."
29-07-2018T02:27:16,MrEase,I feel like Nora's done EVERYTHING
29-07-2018T02:27:35,Twokinds,She's really old. She's probably done a lot of things.
29-07-2018T02:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,Probably...given infinite time
29-07-2018T02:27:45,ZRO4825,"Well she's obviously done a few thigns, considering Reni's talk about dragon family lines. :joy:"
29-07-2018T02:27:47,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
29-07-2018T02:27:51,ThingsAreMoving,Someone called?
29-07-2018T02:28:11,Bgrmystr2,"well, things that are done have probably moved in some way"
29-07-2018T02:28:15,Bgrmystr2,so.. yes
29-07-2018T02:28:29,ZRO4825,But things you call dead haven't yet had a chance to be born. :V
29-07-2018T02:29:11,ThingsAreMoving,They are still moving
29-07-2018T02:30:31,iliar,Okay. I need go to work. Good night.
29-07-2018T02:30:36,Dadrobit,o/
29-07-2018T02:30:37,Twokinds,Bye
29-07-2018T02:30:39,MrEase,What was Nora doing when Trace was evil?
29-07-2018T02:30:41,ThingsAreMoving,"Bye, Iliar"
29-07-2018T02:30:45,BadFoMo,Good night.
29-07-2018T02:30:48,FenceEqualizer,Night
29-07-2018T02:30:53,MrEase,or is that a spoiler
29-07-2018T02:30:56,BadFoMo,Thanks for the logs!
29-07-2018T02:31:01,MrEase,bye!
29-07-2018T02:32:06,BadFoMo,"Also, I think I'll just let my mind run wild with the Fetish-y questions about what Nora has done that ask."
29-07-2018T02:32:11,Twokinds,"Oh you know, dragony things"
29-07-2018T02:32:24,MrEase,dragon-y things?
29-07-2018T02:32:36,Twokinds,Things dragons do.
29-07-2018T02:33:01,MrEase,"demanding sacrifices from villages that don't know any better, hoarding gold, that sort of thing?"
29-07-2018T02:33:04,Twokinds,Skiing.
29-07-2018T02:33:12,ThingsAreMoving,Snorkeling?
29-07-2018T02:33:23,TorqueEmUp,Eating people
29-07-2018T02:33:29,unsteddyphoenix,Beimg super into him
29-07-2018T02:33:53,Twokinds,"Uh, excuse me, MrEase, dragon's don't all do that. Those are, like, really offensive stereotypes"
29-07-2018T02:34:07,FenceEqualizer,Attempting to rob the cradle
29-07-2018T02:34:32,Bgrmystr2,xD
29-07-2018T02:34:52,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
29-07-2018T02:35:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Girls love a bad boy, even true amongst dragons"
29-07-2018T02:35:04,BadFoMo,"Flying, breathing fire, laughing a the makers of Dragon Dildos for not doing their 'homework'."
29-07-2018T02:35:05,MrEase,I feel like Nora would at least run up on a village to try that at least once just as a prank
29-07-2018T02:35:33,MrEase,then come back to find they actually did send her a sacrifice and be really confused
29-07-2018T02:36:06,ThingsAreMoving,"It's not a sacrifice, if the subject is willing. :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:"
29-07-2018T02:36:46,FenceEqualizer,"Which makes me wonder, are there feral dragons? We know dragons can be intelligent and powerful but what about those that are more akin to a large way to powerful animal?"
29-07-2018T02:37:07,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.
29-07-2018T02:37:13,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Rex
29-07-2018T02:37:15,unsteddyphoenix,Like dragonlings?
29-07-2018T02:37:19,BadFoMo,Good night.
29-07-2018T02:37:25,FenceEqualizer,O/
29-07-2018T02:38:05,FenceEqualizer,Maybe? Thinking more like the ye olde fantasy dragon that run on pure animal instincts.
29-07-2018T02:38:50,Twokinds,"There are animal versions of Dragons, yes"
29-07-2018T02:39:03,Twokinds,That's what Natani's stuff is made of
29-07-2018T02:39:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Squirrels, right?"
29-07-2018T02:39:11,unsteddyphoenix,Oh
29-07-2018T02:39:28,Twokinds,Drakescale and wyrm silk
29-07-2018T02:39:33,Twokinds,or whatever I said that page
29-07-2018T02:40:46,FenceEqualizer,"See when I read dragon scales I just thought they where pilfered from a very confuse dragon that was molting "" Gross why do you humans want that!?"""
29-07-2018T02:41:26,MrEase,I'm guessing thats where Adrakists get their scales to magically graft onto their bodies
29-07-2018T02:42:00,MrEase,either from molted scales or from drakes and wyrms
29-07-2018T02:43:41,BadFoMo,"Maiden: I... I'm here, Dragon. As demanded. Nora: ...Who are you? Maiden: ...I am the sacrofice you demanded of my village to leave us in peace. Nora: ...(Thinking)... Oh! right! Now I remember! Uh, you are free to go. Maiden: What?"
29-07-2018T02:43:55,BadFoMo,Late post is late.
29-07-2018T02:44:06,MrEase,somewhat lol
29-07-2018T02:44:43,MrEase,"Or do Adrakists not take their scales, and its just a forced transformation from magic"
29-07-2018T02:45:07,BadFoMo,"Also, these animal like Dragons; are they like Ghouls from Fallout?"
29-07-2018T02:45:34,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what i assumed ease
29-07-2018T02:46:02,FenceEqualizer,The adrakist feels very cultists
29-07-2018T02:46:21,Twokinds,Uh no
29-07-2018T02:46:26,BadFoMo,@MrEase That's what I thought too.
29-07-2018T02:46:28,Twokinds,They're like... apes to humans
29-07-2018T02:46:55,unsteddyphoenix,The akidrasts??
29-07-2018T02:46:57,ThingsAreMoving,"The real question is, do the adrakist nom squirrels like regular dragons do"
29-07-2018T02:47:02,FenceEqualizer,Could easy see them hunting feral lesser dragons to become one with them.
29-07-2018T02:47:16,Twokinds,Sigh no
29-07-2018T02:47:55,ThingsAreMoving,hunt something that you literally worship?
29-07-2018T02:48:10,ThingsAreMoving,that's unlikely
29-07-2018T02:48:19,BadFoMo,So there's two ki- types of Dragons?
29-07-2018T02:48:32,MrEase,I feel like there are like 3 questions going around that are overlapping and getting confusing
29-07-2018T02:48:36,FenceEqualizer,Depends on why they worship. You got Nora grand dragons. Then you got big komodo dragon
29-07-2018T02:49:26,FenceEqualizer,Though it's Tom lore not mines I am just imagining for fun
29-07-2018T02:49:46,ThingsAreMoving,imaginating things is fun
29-07-2018T02:50:10,ThingsAreMoving,sometimes i stare at ink-covered paper for hours and hallucinate vividly
29-07-2018T02:50:33,FenceEqualizer,Colored ink or black ink?
29-07-2018T02:50:41,ThingsAreMoving,mostly black
29-07-2018T02:50:53,unsteddyphoenix,Drugs or ni drugs?
29-07-2018T02:51:02,MrEase,I just draw horrible stuff
29-07-2018T02:51:06,ThingsAreMoving,no drugs while reading
29-07-2018T02:51:27,MrEase,thats where all my imagination goes
29-07-2018T02:51:35,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
29-07-2018T02:52:22,ThingsAreMoving,gonna watch the last hour of stream that I've missed
29-07-2018T02:52:40,BadFoMo,...Can food and drinks be enchanted?
29-07-2018T02:52:58,ThingsAreMoving,enchanted with roofies
29-07-2018T02:53:00,ThingsAreMoving,lol
29-07-2018T02:53:09,unsteddyphoenix,D:
29-07-2018T02:53:27,FenceEqualizer,We've seen magical brews couldn't see why food and drinks couldn't be enchanted
29-07-2018T02:54:03,MrEase,"maybe thats what makes Tom's pizza delivery service so damn good, the pizza isn't just regular pizza"
29-07-2018T02:54:13,MrEase,its magic pizza
29-07-2018T02:54:17,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ofc it could
29-07-2018T02:54:30,unsteddyphoenix,Pizza is already magic
29-07-2018T02:55:10,MrEase,too bad Tom the pizza man was knocked out by sythe and left to die in a literal war zone
29-07-2018T02:55:14,MrEase,RIP
29-07-2018T02:55:38,ThingsAreMoving,wasn't it Red who fought the dude?
29-07-2018T02:55:46,unsteddyphoenix,Luckily he bought his way out. With pizza
29-07-2018T02:56:03,MrEase,no this was later
29-07-2018T02:56:11,MrEase,when group B became a thing
29-07-2018T02:56:18,MrEase,and the wolves attacked the town
29-07-2018T02:56:32,ThingsAreMoving,"huh, didn't remember that one"
29-07-2018T02:56:58,MrEase,oh wait no
29-07-2018T02:57:02,MrEase,that was still tom
29-07-2018T02:57:08,MrEase,but he was a postman
29-07-2018T02:57:14,MrEase,not a pizza guy
29-07-2018T02:57:54,MrEase,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/532/
29-07-2018T02:58:38,UrbanRangers,Woah there are still people on
29-07-2018T02:58:54,Bgrmystr2,There's alawys people on.
29-07-2018T02:58:57,ThingsAreMoving,^
29-07-2018T02:59:36,ThingsAreMoving,any way to get a popout of a stream recording?
29-07-2018T03:00:54,unsteddyphoenix,Dunno actually
29-07-2018T03:02:27,ThingsAreMoving,Can't see any obvious means to do it.
29-07-2018T03:04:49,Bgrmystr2,how do you mean popout? Cuz it's fairly easy to do that
29-07-2018T03:05:07,Bgrmystr2,to pop it into it's own window? or to get it to open in a tab by itself?
29-07-2018T03:05:43,ThingsAreMoving,either is fine
29-07-2018T03:06:09,ThingsAreMoving,i can make a live stream a popout into it's own window
29-07-2018T03:06:14,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. you just right click the video on the videos page and open in new tab..
29-07-2018T03:06:55,ThingsAreMoving,yeah... that works
29-07-2018T03:07:05,Bgrmystr2,"Ah, clicking it doesn't open it's own window anymore"
29-07-2018T03:07:07,Bgrmystr2,interesting
29-07-2018T03:07:22,ThingsAreMoving,there's an embedded player.
29-07-2018T03:07:34,ThingsAreMoving,didn't even think to open the individual file in new tab
29-07-2018T03:07:42,ThingsAreMoving,gonna need some coffee
29-07-2018T03:09:03,Bgrmystr2,I have the thumb button on my mouse set up to do the same as the middle click
29-07-2018T03:09:06,Bgrmystr2,open in a new window
29-07-2018T03:09:18,Bgrmystr2,"so I tend to do that with a lot of stuff, including the streams and such"
29-07-2018T03:09:48,Bgrmystr2,cuz I can just grab the tab that opens and make it's own window by itself out of it
29-07-2018T03:10:04,Bgrmystr2,or just have it as a different tab that doesn't interrupt the current one
29-07-2018T03:10:18,MrEase,I need to get back to streaming when I draw my stuff but now I make my files big so not only does it already lag but OBS is overkill
29-07-2018T03:10:55,ThingsAreMoving,Yup. I just wanted last night's stream on my second monitor so I could chat here and watch what I've missed
29-07-2018T03:12:20,Bgrmystr2,"yeh jus open it in a new tab things, and drag the tab over to the other display"
29-07-2018T03:12:25,Bgrmystr2,and it'll just make a new window
29-07-2018T03:12:31,ThingsAreMoving,did that
29-07-2018T03:12:34,Bgrmystr2,easy stuff
29-07-2018T03:12:44,ThingsAreMoving,I was trying to find a popout buttin on the player
29-07-2018T03:12:49,ThingsAreMoving,button
29-07-2018T03:12:57,Bgrmystr2,naw prolly not there anymore
29-07-2018T03:13:05,ThingsAreMoving,noep
29-07-2018T03:14:38,ThingsAreMoving,funny thing how 'last night' was mere seven hours ago
29-07-2018T03:15:43,UrbanRangers,"Still technically night, unless you live further east"
29-07-2018T03:15:57,ThingsAreMoving,I live in the UK
29-07-2018T03:16:10,UrbanRangers,"Oh well, good morning"
29-07-2018T03:16:18,ThingsAreMoving,It's monday morning and the world isn't on fire
29-07-2018T03:16:23,UrbanRangers,Its 1 here
29-07-2018T03:16:35,unsteddyphoenix,As promised
29-07-2018T03:16:48,ThingsAreMoving,Unfteddy is a man of his word
29-07-2018T03:17:11,Bgrmystr2,Did he say it would be as such?
29-07-2018T03:17:23,ThingsAreMoving,"yup, but it was 1pm when he said that"
29-07-2018T03:17:38,ThingsAreMoving,but I'll give gim the benefit of the doubt
29-07-2018T03:17:38,UrbanRangers,I missed what he promised
29-07-2018T03:17:43,ThingsAreMoving,him*
29-07-2018T03:17:44,Bgrmystr2,"He said so, and you doubted him? You had to wait till now to make sure?"
29-07-2018T03:17:55,BadFoMo,I have 4:17 PM.
29-07-2018T03:18:11,unsteddyphoenix,Asia?
29-07-2018T03:18:12,ThingsAreMoving,I did not doubt him
29-07-2018T03:18:15,BadFoMo,*AM
29-07-2018T03:18:25,unsteddyphoenix,Ah
29-07-2018T03:18:29,UrbanRangers,East coast
29-07-2018T03:18:35,Bgrmystr2,"To be fair, it was probably a good idea to question phoenix anyway. It is phoenix after all. :V"
29-07-2018T03:18:42,BadFoMo,Why did I think PM?
29-07-2018T03:19:05,ThingsAreMoving,I don't want to believe that unfteddy would lie to me
29-07-2018T03:19:10,Bgrmystr2,"cuz you're a derp, Fomo"
29-07-2018T03:19:27,unsteddyphoenix,Its 8pm now fire status minimal
29-07-2018T03:19:30,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think he lies to anyone. Unless he does, in which case, he's a face."
29-07-2018T03:20:01,ThingsAreMoving,"I only lie when it's funny, or leads to funny things"
29-07-2018T03:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,Never in my life have i lied
29-07-2018T03:20:12,ThingsAreMoving,otherwise it's counter productive
29-07-2018T03:20:37,UrbanRangers,Is that a lie?
29-07-2018T03:20:54,unsteddyphoenix,Nnnno
29-07-2018T03:21:16,ThingsAreMoving,"My next statement is true, my previous statement is a lie"
29-07-2018T03:21:54,Bgrmystr2,things pls
29-07-2018T03:22:04,UrbanRangers,So you lie about lying?
29-07-2018T03:22:39,ThingsAreMoving,perhaps
29-07-2018T03:23:01,UrbanRangers,Does that mean you were telling the truth?
29-07-2018T03:23:26,ThingsAreMoving,Never in my life have I told the truth
29-07-2018T03:23:30,ThingsAreMoving,...wait
29-07-2018T03:23:47,ThingsAreMoving,never did I lie
29-07-2018T03:25:46,UrbanRangers,"Its weird that you can lie about lying, but if its true you are telling the truth you are still telling the truth."
29-07-2018T03:26:40,ThingsAreMoving,Imagine how mindblown was the first person in history that lied and others believed it
29-07-2018T03:27:03,Bgrmystr2,Would you guys consider sarcasm as lying on a technicality? :o
29-07-2018T03:27:14,unsteddyphoenix,Ive seen that movie
29-07-2018T03:27:53,UrbanRangers,If sarcasm is lying then jokes must be a lie
29-07-2018T03:28:43,ThingsAreMoving,Sarcasm is a double edge sword. If you use sarcasm on an idiot he might just think you're stupid
29-07-2018T03:29:49,UrbanRangers,But if you know you arent stupid does it matter?
29-07-2018T03:30:30,ThingsAreMoving,"I am smart, therefore I know how stupid I am"
29-07-2018T03:30:37,Bgrmystr2,I'd say yes it does matter cuz if your whole point was to use sarcasm to make him see that he was stupid and he's too stupid to see it to begin with
29-07-2018T03:30:39,Bgrmystr2,then you've failed
29-07-2018T03:31:05,ThingsAreMoving,bgr is smart as well
29-07-2018T03:31:07,UrbanRangers,I guess it depends on intent
29-07-2018T03:31:19,Bgrmystr2,yeh intent matters
29-07-2018T03:32:45,UrbanRangers,You just need to recognize your audience
29-07-2018T03:41:54,Dadrobit,"Okie Dokie, I think I'm heading to bed."
29-07-2018T03:42:11,UrbanRangers,Night
29-07-2018T03:42:19,ThingsAreMoving,NN Dadd-o
29-07-2018T03:42:33,BadFoMo,Good night.
29-07-2018T03:44:11,UrbanRangers,You think Raine is considered a Werewolf?
29-07-2018T03:46:04,Bgrmystr2,No
29-07-2018T03:46:07,Bgrmystr2,she's human
29-07-2018T03:46:28,Bgrmystr2,she inherited perfect transformation from her father and doesn't know how to control it
29-07-2018T03:46:42,UrbanRangers,But her father was a wolf
29-07-2018T03:46:53,Bgrmystr2,"perfect transformation, bro"
29-07-2018T03:47:10,ThingsAreMoving,you know what's worse than a werewolf?
29-07-2018T03:47:12,Bgrmystr2,"it's not up for debate, it was confirmed by tom several times"
