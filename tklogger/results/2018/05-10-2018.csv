05-10-2018T14:17:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve yet to get my stuff but they’ve also delayed the Jacksepticeye pins shipment
05-10-2018T14:18:24,FoxxTrotter,"I'm also waiting on Skidd and Phuufy's book (UQ Vol 2), but I haven't seen an update on that since April."

05-10-2018T14:47:06,Mihari,Especially since you know we can do it in under 15 minutes XD

05-10-2018T14:47:19,Mihari,That late? Really?

05-10-2018T14:59:50,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: mmmmornin
05-10-2018T15:00:09,Bgrmystr2,slow chat recently I see
05-10-2018T15:00:21,Rosscoe,Evening all! Its a great day for coloring!
05-10-2018T15:01:18,SageSaga,Saturdays are usually slower Chat days
05-10-2018T15:01:34,Soundbytee,I look away for a few minutes and already there has been so much progress
05-10-2018T15:02:10,FoxxTrotter,Mmm-hmm.
05-10-2018T15:06:50,Rosscoe,Its quite cause your coloring in some booty Sage
05-10-2018T15:06:57,Rosscoe,stares at Nyna's booty
05-10-2018T15:10:52,Soundbytee,Zooms in *staring intensifies*
05-10-2018T15:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Look! A distraction from the booty! :csagesaga-bounce:
05-10-2018T15:11:09,Rosscoe,inhales
05-10-2018T15:11:37,Rosscoe,THe breasts of the female body are just a replacement for the booty for there was a time we were prime apes and walekd on all fours for the most part.
05-10-2018T15:12:03,Rosscoe,"All we seen was the booty, not a days its ""Do I check out her booty, or her chest?"""
05-10-2018T15:12:07,Rosscoe,Such conflicing choices
05-10-2018T15:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet both are just mounds of fatty flesh...
05-10-2018T15:16:43,SageSaga,brb
05-10-2018T15:19:46,Rosscoe,"He brb's on Nyna looking ""Oh really?"" at us :("
05-10-2018T15:23:16,Tharkis,Nyna is not impressed with her fans :ctharkis-earwiggle:
05-10-2018T15:23:38,Bgrmystr2,most characters would not be.
05-10-2018T15:23:55,Mippy,"Hello, break time at work"
05-10-2018T15:25:15,Mippy,And the buildings wifi is actually working for once
05-10-2018T15:28:01,SageSaga,back
05-10-2018T15:28:07,Bgrmystr2,wb
05-10-2018T15:28:18,Mippy,Hello Sage
05-10-2018T15:28:44,SageSaga,howdy Mippy
05-10-2018T15:30:53,Iceburgh,Guten tag. Been a while since I was here last.
05-10-2018T15:31:50,SageSaga,hello
05-10-2018T15:32:29,Iceburgh,How goes things?
05-10-2018T15:32:52,SageSaga,alright i suppose
05-10-2018T15:33:34,Bgrmystr2,heya Ice
05-10-2018T15:33:38,Iceburgh,How goes?
05-10-2018T15:34:55,Bgrmystr2,"doin okay.. some real good, some real bad"
05-10-2018T15:36:35,Iceburgh,"Well, being alive is the first step to a good day."
05-10-2018T15:37:08,Mippy,"I don’t believe we have met, Ice."
05-10-2018T15:37:11,Iceburgh,I've been working on a long-term project that's finally coming together.
05-10-2018T15:37:35,Iceburgh,It's been quite a while since I was last here.
05-10-2018T15:37:56,Iceburgh,"Like, maybe a year or so."
05-10-2018T15:39:13,Mippy,Ohhhh...that’s why I haven’t seen you in merge chat. I’ve mostly been a Tom regular for...like seven months now...
05-10-2018T15:40:34,Iceburgh,"Yeah, I can't really call myself a regular, since I'm usually passed out this time of day, and the times I'm not I usually have something else going on so catching the live streams are hit-or-miss for me."
05-10-2018T15:40:40,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I remember Iceburgh :)
05-10-2018T15:40:53,Mippy,Just started following Sage while Tom was in Korea.
05-10-2018T15:41:13,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it took you that long mippy
05-10-2018T15:41:17,Bgrmystr2,after being here for 7 months
05-10-2018T15:41:19,Bgrmystr2,a bit late
05-10-2018T15:41:19,Iceburgh,Heh. Glad to know that I'm memorable.
05-10-2018T15:41:24,Rosscoe,Welcoem back Sage (yeus I am late saying so)
05-10-2018T15:41:43,Mippy,I know Bgr. I’m rather embarrassed 😳
05-10-2018T15:42:03,Bgrmystr2,I remember... most active people if I see their names again
05-10-2018T15:42:27,Iceburgh,I think it only took me a week or two to follow Sage after coming here for Tom originally.
05-10-2018T15:42:53,Pimsan,hiya! missed anything?
05-10-2018T15:43:07,Bgrmystr2,coloring :u
05-10-2018T15:43:13,Iceburgh,"But I've been catching a ton of live streams today, so that makes me happy."
05-10-2018T15:43:26,Iceburgh,And I'm a week away from lighting up my forge.
05-10-2018T15:43:40,Mippy,"I’m slow to change my habits. Tom was a habit (I needed my weekly fix), Sage wasn’t. I’m trying to change that."
05-10-2018T15:44:03,SageSaga,does your forge run on human souls?
05-10-2018T15:44:07,Iceburgh,"Habits are hard to change, no doubt about that"
05-10-2018T15:44:11,Iceburgh,"No, coal."
05-10-2018T15:44:22,SageSaga,so dinosaur souls - good
05-10-2018T15:44:35,Mippy,Ooooo...forge. I’d like to try that sometime
05-10-2018T15:44:37,Iceburgh,"Older than dinosaurs, actually."
05-10-2018T15:44:48,Iceburgh,So pre-dinosaur souls.
05-10-2018T15:45:03,SageSaga,ah- Primordial souls- even better
05-10-2018T15:45:30,Mippy,I’m not aware of a lot of ladies in that industry though
05-10-2018T15:45:55,Tharkis,plenty of women blacksmiths
05-10-2018T15:46:09,Soundbytee,I gotta bounce. Byee. Looking forward to seeing the finished product Sage
05-10-2018T15:46:12,Iceburgh,"Cambrian, I think. Meh, now I'm just getting pedantic. Really old stuff that burns hot and gets steel to stick together and lose magnetism."
05-10-2018T15:46:17,Tharkis,i can put you in touch with a dozen tomorrow if you want lol
05-10-2018T15:46:37,Iceburgh,New Penny Forge.
05-10-2018T15:46:40,Bgrmystr2,xD Tharkis with the connections
05-10-2018T15:46:59,SageSaga,Tharkis is a true Blacksmith
05-10-2018T15:47:04,Bgrmystr2,that he is.
05-10-2018T15:47:20,Iceburgh,"And Jess from Christ Centered Ironworks does occasionally as well. I'd like to see more, though."
05-10-2018T15:47:35,Mippy,Tharkis super connected....*gasp*....the head of the blacksmith mob
05-10-2018T15:47:48,Tharkis,pfft
05-10-2018T15:48:23,Tharkis,"i'm connected because i'm a member of a lot of blacksmith organizations, and on the board of directors of one of hte largest blacksmithing organizations in the USA"
05-10-2018T15:48:31,Tharkis,no mafia involvement
05-10-2018T15:48:42,Bgrmystr2,"""..probably"""
05-10-2018T15:48:53,SageSaga,of course- they are run by the Lizard People
05-10-2018T15:48:57,Bgrmystr2,"if they are involved, tharkis doesn't know about it."
05-10-2018T15:49:09,Bgrmystr2,which is.. probably more safe?
05-10-2018T15:49:10,Bgrmystr2,:v
05-10-2018T15:49:29,Mippy,Oh dang! Just a lot of secret societies then.
05-10-2018T15:49:39,Bgrmystr2,btw do any of you know how much an electric car costs to recharge
05-10-2018T15:49:51,Bgrmystr2,"from empty to fill, just a ballpark"
05-10-2018T15:49:55,Bgrmystr2,full* even
05-10-2018T15:50:00,Iceburgh,I drive a Prius. That's the closest I come.
05-10-2018T15:50:00,Tharkis,"depends, you mean at your hose?"
05-10-2018T15:50:03,Mippy,Nope...I have a 1999 Volvo
05-10-2018T15:50:07,Bgrmystr2,yeah at a house
05-10-2018T15:50:08,SageSaga,"the lizard people are a kind benevolent race, all praise the scales of justice"
05-10-2018T15:50:12,Tharkis,house even
05-10-2018T15:50:12,Bgrmystr2,xD sage
05-10-2018T15:50:28,Mippy,*praise*
05-10-2018T15:50:36,Bgrmystr2,We just got a $950 bill after having 3 months of $45 or so power bills.
05-10-2018T15:50:44,Iceburgh,!!!
05-10-2018T15:50:52,Bgrmystr2,so.. something went absolutely terribly horribly wrong
05-10-2018T15:51:02,Mippy,0_0
05-10-2018T15:51:25,Iceburgh,THAT doesn't sound remotely right!
05-10-2018T15:51:31,Tharkis,"depends on your electric costs, but atm if yo're paying 11 cent per kWh, about 2.50 per 100 miles of batter charge"
05-10-2018T15:52:06,Tharkis,that sounds very wrong
05-10-2018T15:52:12,Mippy,"Well, time flies when you’re having fun. As much as I’d love to stay, I have to get back to work. See you all soon, hopefully"
05-10-2018T15:52:29,SageSaga,take care
05-10-2018T15:52:30,Tharkis,most figures are in cost per 100 miles
05-10-2018T15:52:43,Tharkis,but for example the chevy volt says 15k miles a year costs about 600$ in electric
05-10-2018T15:52:49,Iceburgh,"And electric cars have what, a 200 mile range?"
05-10-2018T15:53:03,Bgrmystr2,oh wow so they're fairly cheap then
05-10-2018T15:53:20,Bgrmystr2,there's no way it'd be that.. it'd have to be a LOT of electric cars
05-10-2018T15:53:32,Iceburgh,"Yeah. Either there's a screwup in the paperwork, or there's a massive short somewhere dumping power."
05-10-2018T15:53:37,Bgrmystr2,"thanks, that helps"
05-10-2018T15:53:50,Iceburgh,And what is this song from???
05-10-2018T15:53:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah I think the box is fucked or someone's stealing a LOT of power for whatever reason
05-10-2018T15:54:13,Iceburgh,That's an industrial level of power.
05-10-2018T15:54:26,Iceburgh,Disgaea maybe?
05-10-2018T15:54:56,Bgrmystr2,usual powers at like 400.. approaching 7000 to 8000 now
05-10-2018T15:55:10,Bgrmystr2,for a single month
05-10-2018T15:55:41,SageSaga,*unhooks the cloning tank*
05-10-2018T15:56:10,Bgrmystr2,XD I knew it
05-10-2018T15:56:12,Bgrmystr2,it was sage all along
05-10-2018T15:58:14,Tharkis,"ah but the question is, who was Sage cloning?!"
05-10-2018T15:58:18,Tharkis,might be worth the cost !
05-10-2018T15:58:44,SageSaga,my special power allows me to open small wormholes about 3 inches in diameter - so long as something is running through them they stay open. I use them to plug things into other peoples outlets all over the country- because i cant afford to buy adapters
05-10-2018T15:58:48,Tharkis,we could use a few extra kate and nyna running around
05-10-2018T15:59:04,SageSaga,so i get at the outlets people cover up like behind their dressers and beds
05-10-2018T16:00:01,Tharkis,need to figure out if anything good will be on the air for anime this season
05-10-2018T16:00:14,SageSaga,there is!
05-10-2018T16:00:16,Tharkis,"with steins gate finished, overlord finished, my hero academia finished, etc"
05-10-2018T16:00:21,Tharkis,i'm not sure what to watch =D
05-10-2018T16:00:26,SageSaga,That time I got Reincarnated as a Slime!
05-10-2018T16:00:38,Tharkis,i'll have to check that one out and add it to my list
05-10-2018T16:01:04,SageSaga,i also heard of one called Goblin Slayer- no idea if it is good but it looked interesting from the art i saw
05-10-2018T16:02:27,SageSaga,"here is the intro on VRV - Rumor has it that, in a certain guild in the middle of nowhere, there is an extraordinary man who has climbed all the way to the Silver rank just by killing goblins."
05-10-2018T16:02:48,SageSaga,"At the same guild, a priestess who's just become a new adventurer has formed her first party... and the man who ends up rescuing that party when they get into trouble is none other than the Goblin Slayer."
05-10-2018T16:03:08,SageSaga,"and the quote - ""I'm not saving the world. I just kill goblins."""
05-10-2018T16:03:18,Tharkis,"hrm, different, will add it to my list"
05-10-2018T16:03:37,SageSaga,oh- and the New season of Jojo started
05-10-2018T16:03:53,Tharkis,"hah, i need to watch the re-lauched jojo still"
05-10-2018T16:03:57,Tharkis,i've only ever seen the original 80s jojo
05-10-2018T16:04:10,SageSaga,the new ones are sooooo good
05-10-2018T16:04:30,SageSaga,the intros are so hype
05-10-2018T16:04:42,SageSaga,some of the outros too
05-10-2018T16:04:45,Tharkis,the original were so overthe top cheesy that i didnt put the re-launch on my list heh
05-10-2018T16:05:04,Tharkis,will toss that on my queue
05-10-2018T16:06:21,SageSaga,RWBY's new season starts at the end of the month
05-10-2018T16:06:38,Tharkis,yeah some place near me is doing an oct30 premeir ont he big screen thing
05-10-2018T16:06:51,Tharkis,at the theater the next town over
05-10-2018T16:07:03,Iceburgh,Now I want to rewatch Macross and Hellsing Ultimate...
05-10-2018T16:08:35,SageSaga,oh there was a weird anime on Netflix-
05-10-2018T16:08:40,SageSaga,about Dragon Pilots
05-10-2018T16:10:56,Bgrmystr2,I found one literally called Dragon Pilot lol
05-10-2018T16:10:59,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-10-2018T16:11:05,Bgrmystr2,guessing that's it?
05-10-2018T16:11:20,Mihari,I thought it was cute.
05-10-2018T16:11:31,SageSaga,it is cute- it is also weird
05-10-2018T16:11:34,Mihari,"Not my typical favorite look for dragons, but still cute."
05-10-2018T16:11:52,Mihari,Well if you break things down to their basics a lot of anime is weird in some aspect XD
05-10-2018T16:12:00,SageSaga,i dont like the end
05-10-2018T16:12:10,SageSaga,not the very end but- yeah
05-10-2018T16:12:29,Iceburgh,"Sadly, I don't have Netflix, nor any of the other streaming platforms."
05-10-2018T16:15:01,Tharkis,crunchroll is hte only one i've got htat i'm current / paid up on
05-10-2018T16:15:10,Tharkis,i re-sub to netflix every once in a while and binge stuff
05-10-2018T16:16:24,Iceburgh,I have neither the card nor the funding for any of them.
05-10-2018T16:20:32,Bgrmystr2,"Same, Ice"
05-10-2018T16:21:07,SageSaga,Crunchy Roll has a free service function too
05-10-2018T16:21:17,SageSaga,lower resolution and a week behind but still
05-10-2018T16:21:58,Iceburgh,"Most of what I want to watch has been out for years, thankfully."
05-10-2018T16:22:01,SageSaga,CrunchyRoll's motto is Anime is For Everyone
05-10-2018T16:22:28,SageSaga,"""But if you want it now- ya gotta pay!"" XD"
05-10-2018T16:23:01,Iceburgh,So how to I tell them that? The lowest price I see is $6.99 per month.
05-10-2018T16:23:16,Bgrmystr2,is their lower resolution like.. 480p low? or 720p low?
05-10-2018T16:23:19,SageSaga,just go to the site and watch stuff
05-10-2018T16:23:23,SageSaga,480p i think
05-10-2018T16:23:27,Bgrmystr2,rip
05-10-2018T16:23:49,Bgrmystr2,we're in the age of 4k being a thing.. and 720p is still considered too HD
05-10-2018T16:23:50,SageSaga,hey- i grew up of 480! downloading 171MB files every week
05-10-2018T16:23:56,Bgrmystr2,same
05-10-2018T16:24:18,Iceburgh,I grew up on Betamax and VHS.
05-10-2018T16:24:28,Bgrmystr2,it's like nothing has changed in the past 10-12 years.. >.>
05-10-2018T16:25:21,SageSaga,my first anime was Project A-Ko
05-10-2018T16:28:40,SageSaga,"the anime about a group of Japanese people that said ""We need a cool character- who is a cool character?"" ""Wonder Woman and Superman?"" ""Ok- we are making a story about the daughter of Wonder Woman and Superman!"""
05-10-2018T16:30:41,SageSaga,that's only partially a joke- A-ko is legit the daughter of a Superman and Wonder woman knock off
05-10-2018T16:35:19,Iceburgh,Huh. Never knew Galaxy Express 999 was a series.
05-10-2018T16:36:58,Iceburgh,Wish the search results would show more than 6 at a time...
05-10-2018T16:39:15,SageSaga,on crunchy Roll?
05-10-2018T16:39:31,Iceburgh,Yeah. 114 results for Galaxy Express 999.
05-10-2018T16:39:47,SageSaga,you get what you pay for
05-10-2018T16:39:58,Iceburgh,True that.
05-10-2018T16:43:35,Bgrmystr2,"There's an OVA, a movie, a 113ep show, and another two movies after that"
05-10-2018T16:43:43,Bgrmystr2,so they may not have everything
05-10-2018T16:45:14,Iceburgh,"There's the Galaxy Express movie, a sequel (Adieu Galaxy Express 999), the series, and I don't know what all else beyond that."
05-10-2018T16:45:35,Iceburgh,"I was hoping for the original movie, but I'll take what I can get."
05-10-2018T16:45:51,Iceburgh,I'm just exploring what they have at the moment.
05-10-2018T16:46:36,Iceburgh,Some of it is stuff that I grew up with.
05-10-2018T16:47:12,SageSaga,all done
05-10-2018T16:47:19,SageSaga,thanks for joining folks
05-10-2018T16:47:32,Bgrmystr2,"cool, thanks for streamin ;d"

05-10-2018T17:00:45,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
05-10-2018T17:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Too late. Everyone’s left
05-10-2018T17:18:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Even I’m off for a nap
05-10-2018T17:28:43,ThingsAreMoving,\o/
05-10-2018T17:29:00,ThingsAreMoving,where is my dollah?!
05-10-2018T17:29:15,ThingsAreMoving,"oh, here it is"

05-10-2018T17:43:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, not gonna be around much longer myself. Gonna go play some Poker with the brother in laws."
05-10-2018T17:47:00,ThingsAreMoving,I am so ready for tomorrow
05-10-2018T17:47:18,ThingsAreMoving,got a day off on monday so I'll be able to stay up all night <3
05-10-2018T17:58:07,CommanderTrace,hello :ptv-greetings::grinning:
05-10-2018T17:59:07,CrRAR,hiya
05-10-2018T18:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Somehow, I’ve managed to get two days off"
05-10-2018T18:03:26,SpazztasticKiwi,IN A ROW
05-10-2018T18:04:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Also it amazes me how I can be tired but can never be more woke than the moment I try laying down for a nap
05-10-2018T18:11:04,CrRAR,wow the fates have decided in your favor... not on the count of naps though.
05-10-2018T18:12:01,CrRAR,"I guess they're not of the ""have your cake and eat it too"" persuasion."
05-10-2018T18:12:24,CrRAR,:birthday:
05-10-2018T18:12:28,CrRAR,v:
05-10-2018T18:28:52,Bgrmystr2,"well, usually that's not even possible Cr"
05-10-2018T18:44:19,CrRAR,"haha, agreed, I was always confused about that idiom. Seems paradoxically silly."
05-10-2018T18:52:06,ThingsAreMoving,Seems like it's Shrodinger's cake. You have it and ate it until you've checked what has happened to it.
05-10-2018T18:52:43,ThingsAreMoving,quantum cakes are confusing
05-10-2018T18:54:48,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah.. basically, if you put the cake in the box.. and someone may have eaten it.. then yeah"
05-10-2018T18:55:08,Bgrmystr2,"you have the box for the cake, but inside, you either have your cake, or it was eaten"
05-10-2018T18:55:33,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, partial is a possibility when it comes to cake, but it's the same concept as the cat being alive or dead."
05-10-2018T18:55:46,Bgrmystr2,you can't have both.. you just need to open the box and find out.
05-10-2018T18:56:23,ThingsAreMoving,"Once you measure the state of it you know what you have and what you don't  have. Until then you have both, not neither"
05-10-2018T18:56:36,ThingsAreMoving,"quantum physics is quite optimistic, if you ask me."
05-10-2018T18:57:58,Bgrmystr2,"In terms of ""whole cake"" or ""no cake"", there isn't really a middleground"
05-10-2018T18:58:13,Bgrmystr2,cuz allowing a middleground defeats the purpose of the saying anyway xD
05-10-2018T18:59:28,CrRAR,Damn cakes. They're historically problematic.
05-10-2018T19:00:27,ThingsAreMoving,"Also, they're a lie"
05-10-2018T19:00:30,ThingsAreMoving,.
05-10-2018T19:00:40,CrRAR,SEE!?
05-10-2018T19:01:07,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-10-2018T19:01:13,ThingsAreMoving,I've missed this chat. Srsly.
05-10-2018T19:01:48,CrRAR,fo' sho
05-10-2018T19:04:35,ThingsAreMoving,huh... all of my suggestions that have been drawn were Tom's picks. Gotta step up my game.
05-10-2018T19:04:59,Bgrmystr2,indeed
05-10-2018T19:05:05,ThingsAreMoving,Or keep suggesting stuff that's easy and satisfying to draw.
05-10-2018T19:06:40,ThingsAreMoving,"I have a halloween theme suggestion that I'd like to suggest, but I find it unlikely to be picked. What do you thin? ""Skeletons of XY having a good time on halloween."""
05-10-2018T19:06:46,ThingsAreMoving,think*
05-10-2018T19:08:59,ThingsAreMoving,"It's spooky (skeletons), It's challenging to draw (anthro skeletons), It may be fun to draw (skeletons)."
05-10-2018T19:19:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunno about the skeletons part
05-10-2018T19:47:13,ThingsAreMoving,afaik we've never had a drawing including an anthro skeleton. Might be fun
05-10-2018T19:55:15,CrRAR,I feel like the estate might house one or two.

05-10-2018T21:48:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I already have a Nibbly Halloween suggestion
05-10-2018T21:59:09,unsteddyphoenix,Good...gooood...
05-10-2018T22:00:04,BadFoMo,Which should I request? 'Laura as Caleb from Blood (and maybe also holding a Tommy Gun and/or Sawed-Off Shotgun).' or 'WereSquirrel 2! Maddie and Mrs. Nibbly infect (or try to infect) Karen with WereSquirrel-ness.'
05-10-2018T22:00:09,BadFoMo,*?
05-10-2018T22:36:04,CrRAR,Twokinds gonna be 15 pretty soon. :sparkles:

05-10-2018T23:32:14,totallynotTrace,so how did Tom do on his drivers test XD
