14-11-2018T17:20:47,Dadrobit,From a real Mexican joint? Or Taco Bell?
14-11-2018T17:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI order burritos with mouse‚Äù? ‚ÄúI ordered burritos and then a mouse‚Äù?
14-11-2018T17:21:22,Dadrobit,Both are acceptable options. Taco Bell is delicious fast food.
14-11-2018T17:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Both are food. End of discussion
14-11-2018T17:23:26,Dadrobit,I remember quite vividly one of the first times I had authentic home prepared Mexican from a friend of the family as a kid.
14-11-2018T17:23:38,Dadrobit,"""Wow, this is even better than Taco Bell"""
14-11-2018T17:23:58,Dadrobit,The whole room went dead silent as the whole family just kinda gawked at me.
14-11-2018T17:24:21,Twokinds,Ahahaha
14-11-2018T17:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,And they didn‚Äôt throw you out. How nice
14-11-2018T17:24:57,Bgrmystr2,Why would that be surprising if you're a kid lol

14-11-2018T17:25:31,Dadrobit,"Nah, still good friends with them actually. Went to one of the sons' wedding not to terribly long ago. Their goat burritos were unbelievably good."

14-11-2018T17:25:48,TerraTheWizard,i think there's 1 in the whole country so far
14-11-2018T17:25:55,TerraTheWizard,also there's 1 dennys
14-11-2018T17:25:59,Twokinds,I always joke to Lann about Mexican food.
14-11-2018T17:26:37,Dadrobit,Mexican food is no joking matter //s//
14-11-2018T17:26:45,Twokinds,When he talks about eating food in Mexico with his family I ask him if it's as authentic as the stuff from Taco Bell XD

14-11-2018T17:45:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Hint: means pants are a good idea rn
14-11-2018T17:47:49,Dadrobit,"Reminds me of a story of a lady that was delivering a pizza to a very drunk party. The dude who answered the party thought she was one of the ""dancers"" they ordered and shoved a Benjamin down her shirt."

14-11-2018T17:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Change would‚Äôve been the tip
14-11-2018T17:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully
14-11-2018T17:52:05,Bgrmystr2,"well, that's what it means yeah xD"

14-11-2018T17:55:15,RimaDraws,i mean you gonna shove a 20 down my shirt yea im keeping the change
14-11-2018T17:56:51,Dadrobit,Jackson's the $20. Ben's the $100.
14-11-2018T17:57:30,RimaDraws,100 sounds nice too
14-11-2018T17:57:30,Bgrmystr2,keepin the change either way

14-11-2018T17:59:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"$100 to cover however many pizzas they ordered, for a party, mind you"
14-11-2018T18:00:34,Dadrobit,epoxy = a particularly potent glue.
14-11-2018T18:00:35,RimaDraws,actually ill keep the 100 and not give them their change lol
14-11-2018T18:00:40,RimaDraws,maybe yea dad....
14-11-2018T18:00:46,RimaDraws,ive had it to the top of my head with work
14-11-2018T18:00:56,SpazztasticKiwi,So I wonder how much change got left over. Hopefully a nice amount in the end for her
14-11-2018T18:01:01,Dadrobit,And IIRC the change was more than double what they spent on the order.
14-11-2018T18:01:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoo. She got a good tip for her trip then. Good
14-11-2018T18:02:08,Dadrobit,Aye

14-11-2018T23:09:00,SpazztasticKiwi,How many sketches are we talking about?
14-11-2018T23:09:13,Ordithus,"I do recall seeing something like that, somewhere.  But where?"
14-11-2018T23:09:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And can you maybe search by dates or subject?
14-11-2018T23:10:11,unsteddyphoenix,"If he knew the date, he could find them instantly"
14-11-2018T23:12:05,SpazztasticKiwi,So it‚Äôs just ‚ÄúTherie on a stool‚Äù sketch?
14-11-2018T23:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if I‚Äôve seen anything like that
14-11-2018T23:13:19,unsteddyphoenix,All I can think about is Kat on a stool
14-11-2018T23:13:35,unsteddyphoenix,If I knew it then Kat's overwritten it :upside_down:
14-11-2018T23:13:38,SpazztasticKiwi,But isn‚Äôt that gonna be the fun part? Collecting aaall the doodles?
14-11-2018T23:13:47,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta catch'em all~
14-11-2018T23:13:56,SpazztasticKiwi,From every corner
14-11-2018T23:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,And lump them into one corral to be sorted for group posting
14-11-2018T23:14:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Another side project to do of many
14-11-2018T23:15:58,SpazztasticKiwi,No wonder you can‚Äôt spare time for house search. But have fun with that - üçÄ
14-11-2018T23:19:54,Twokinds,"Oh well, guess it's just been lost to time"
14-11-2018T23:20:26,unsteddyphoenix,Im sure SOMEone has it.
14-11-2018T23:20:46,unsteddyphoenix,We could ask those *[weirdos] that kept reqiest theriedaniels
14-11-2018T23:22:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I rather like Therie/Daniels :ctwokinds-flomad:
14-11-2018T23:22:04,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre cute
14-11-2018T23:22:31,Ordithus,:ptv-hearts:
14-11-2018T23:23:06,unsteddyphoenix,:ptv-uneasy:
14-11-2018T23:24:26,Ordithus,Guilty.  As.  Charged.
14-11-2018T23:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Like pudge birb. Must be protected
14-11-2018T23:24:52,unsteddyphoenix,I am simply apalled
14-11-2018T23:25:09,SpazztasticKiwi,üéª
14-11-2018T23:26:08,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
14-11-2018T23:32:47,Bgrmystr2,"I can check my history of images I've saved, but I don't.. recall therie on a barstool..?"
14-11-2018T23:41:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oddness on tumblr apparently. Some seem to think Mark‚Äôs got hacked. I mean, the recent one or two posts are..strange but"
14-11-2018T23:44:55,Vatruvius,Is it not normal for Mark to be strange...?
14-11-2018T23:45:01,Vatruvius,"Also, hi!"
14-11-2018T23:45:05,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
14-11-2018T23:45:07,Ordithus,Yo
14-11-2018T23:45:44,Vatruvius,"Uh-oh, a moderator is here. I better behave...XD"
14-11-2018T23:46:00,Ordithus,"Two mods, and an admin!"
14-11-2018T23:46:20,unsteddyphoenix,:V
14-11-2018T23:46:27,Vatruvius,"Right, but Tom is not really picky. I already found the line before so I know where not to go."
14-11-2018T23:46:42,Vatruvius,You two however...
14-11-2018T23:46:46,Ordithus,BAN
14-11-2018T23:46:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
14-11-2018T23:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah he‚Äôs strange. But I say I can see something slightly off
14-11-2018T23:47:03,unsteddyphoenix,TOO FAR
14-11-2018T23:47:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"He‚Äôs probably just tired, as he covered in the post, but man he can be rude sometimes"
14-11-2018T23:47:36,Vatruvius,I have noticed in the last few weeks Mark's videos have changed. He is the person I remember for years of watching him but at the same time he is...different.
14-11-2018T23:47:41,Vatruvius,Not sure what though...
14-11-2018T23:48:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"There was a change yeah. As he said himself, he hadn‚Äôt been talking to fans/livestreaming like he used to"
14-11-2018T23:48:49,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs picked back up. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs good now
14-11-2018T23:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I do just see those posts as suspicious
14-11-2018T23:50:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Surely he‚Äôd find out that he‚Äôd been hacked though, so.. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
14-11-2018T23:52:03,Vatruvius,"I just went through my library of TwoKinds Patreon posts and found no Therie on a bar stool. I have most of the post on Patreon save for a few, neither do I recall something like that on Patreon. Maybe dA but I am not sure."
14-11-2018T23:52:17,Vatruvius,"Perhaps I am off, most of the conversation was cut off from above..."
14-11-2018T23:52:46,Ordithus,The kicker is I know exactly what it looks like.  But I cannot find it.
14-11-2018T23:52:47,Vatruvius,"Some good news though, I have managed to get a rough story statement for my webcomic. So that is good."
14-11-2018T23:53:28,Vatruvius,"The simple description sound like something I have seen, at least I can construct it in my head. I just do not recall anything like that before...maybe in a stream but not posted?"
14-11-2018T23:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like tom said, it is lost to time"
14-11-2018T23:53:47,SpazztasticKiwi,*mysterious sounds*
14-11-2018T23:54:12,Ordithus,we have entered the twilight zone
14-11-2018T23:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Not terribly concerned. Maybe it‚Äôll pop up later at random. We‚Äôve got plenty of other stuff to :ptv-excited: at when Tom gets it all situated
14-11-2018T23:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,All wonderous
14-11-2018T23:55:21,SpazztasticKiwi,All fabulous
14-11-2018T23:55:47,Vatruvius,Mind if I post my rough story statement? Would like to hear some feedback.
