03-05-2018T00:07:41,SpazztasticKiwi,How does a fight between two immortals end
03-05-2018T00:09:44,Vatruvius,No clear winner. That or one of them is not truly immortal or less immortal than the the other.
03-05-2018T00:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have a feeling that if Jason wasn‚Äôt sunk and Freddy wasn‚Äôt shredded in the end, it‚Äôd be forever"
03-05-2018T00:10:35,SpazztasticKiwi,The only reason they even start fighting is Jason takes one of Freddy‚Äôs kills
03-05-2018T00:10:46,Vatruvius,Oh no! How dare he!
03-05-2018T00:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Then it becomes a slap fight

03-05-2018T00:32:31,Bgrmystr2,to prevent more of them
03-05-2018T00:32:51,Bgrmystr2,apparently they live in wet areas

03-05-2018T01:51:17,unsteddyphoenix,Normal people wouldnt make it here
03-05-2018T01:51:29,Dadrobit,I think I'm fairly normal thank you.
03-05-2018T01:51:36,SpazztasticKiwi,No you‚Äôre not
03-05-2018T01:51:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, you‚Äôre still alive right"
03-05-2018T01:51:55,Dadrobit,:o
03-05-2018T01:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Signing prints at 3 in the morning
03-05-2018T01:52:42,Dadrobit,Not sure if offended...
03-05-2018T01:54:50,unsteddyphoenix,Nobody wants to be normal nowadays right?
03-05-2018T01:55:01,unsteddyphoenix,"""Everyones special"" was hammered into our heads"
03-05-2018T01:56:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom quick question if you‚Äôre still conscious
03-05-2018T01:56:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, my first foray into college taught me just how not special I am."
03-05-2018T01:57:16,unsteddyphoenix,same
03-05-2018T01:58:39,BadFoMo,I too may have a quick question.
03-05-2018T02:09:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mine‚Äôs not comic related so if yours is, go ahead"
03-05-2018T02:17:45,BadFoMo,Mine is (once again) about if my planed sketch request will get snubbed or not.
03-05-2018T02:20:30,BadFoMo,"Eh, I may ask latter in the day time. I think I will take a nap now."
03-05-2018T02:21:29,Dadrobit,I need to get to sleep myself. Need to take my grandfather to the airport tomorrow morning.
03-05-2018T02:21:37,Dadrobit,Have a good one y'all.
03-05-2018T02:21:41,unsteddyphoenix,ok~ godonight

03-05-2018T02:38:05,SpazztasticKiwi,My laptop is choosing now to scan for viruses
03-05-2018T02:38:21,unsteddyphoenix,gotta stay safe~
03-05-2018T02:38:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but who goes in for an exam at 2 am?
03-05-2018T02:39:02,unsteddyphoenix,I would if they were open
03-05-2018T02:39:22,unsteddyphoenix,ideally i'd be completely nocturnal~
03-05-2018T02:40:08,SpazztasticKiwi,They can‚Äôt call you ugly if they can‚Äôt see you
03-05-2018T02:40:54,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha true~
03-05-2018T02:41:02,unsteddyphoenix,Skulk in the darkness
03-05-2018T02:41:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking of planning on going to ComiCon 2019
03-05-2018T02:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,The time will give me time to prepare
03-05-2018T02:43:15,unsteddyphoenix,A yea-long cosplay! :o
03-05-2018T02:43:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Could be fun, I wanna go to one someday"
03-05-2018T02:43:38,unsteddyphoenix,If I ever make respectable cash
03-05-2018T02:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"We could all try planning for 2019, but yeah life is kinda in the way"
03-05-2018T02:45:07,unsteddyphoenix,That and 1000s of miles of ocean for me
03-05-2018T02:45:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd hate to go so far from home though
03-05-2018T02:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt mind flying but I‚Äôve never been to Cali
03-05-2018T02:47:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôm not sure about cosplay. Never have before and I‚Äôm not sure who I‚Äôd be
03-05-2018T02:48:41,unsteddyphoenix,a year to consider it
03-05-2018T02:52:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Voorheesajollygoodfellow
03-05-2018T02:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Still thinking about that one
03-05-2018T02:54:06,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôm gonna try going on to bed now

03-05-2018T16:45:35,Bgrmystr2,"from when you said that, actually 3.5 hours"
03-05-2018T16:47:08,Bgrmystr2,it's 5:46pm Eastern Time right now

03-05-2018T18:41:13,FoxxTrotter,Mmm-hmm...thought so. :cfoxxtrotter-Vulture:
03-05-2018T18:41:53,Vatruvius,What?
03-05-2018T18:42:23,FoxxTrotter,Plenty of vultures perched in Tom's channel. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
03-05-2018T18:43:03,FoxxTrotter,...and a yinglet.
03-05-2018T18:44:30,Vatruvius,"More like hooded figures hiding in shadows, lurkers to be precise, but sure."
03-05-2018T18:44:37,CrRAR,skreeee SKREEEE
03-05-2018T18:44:47,FoxxTrotter,Something a vulture would do.
03-05-2018T18:46:38,Vatruvius,"But I do not scavenge carcasses for food, something vultures do do."
03-05-2018T18:47:10,FoxxTrotter,"Pick, pick..."
03-05-2018T18:47:41,FoxxTrotter,"Anyhoo, lemme continue celebrating me birfday. I'll be bax later. Toodles. :cfoxxtrotter-SlyJoy:"

03-05-2018T18:50:45,Vatruvius,lol
03-05-2018T18:56:03,Vatruvius,I do not think my environmental studies professor could have made a more boring lecture video.
03-05-2018T18:56:20,Vatruvius,:ptv-unimpressed:
03-05-2018T18:57:15,CrRAR,"It's part of the test of collegiate life, if you can survive it, you win."
03-05-2018T18:57:49,Vatruvius,I am well aware of college life and how classes work. But this is literally the most boring lecture ever! And I have 6 years of college experience!
03-05-2018T18:58:28,CrRAR,It'd be pretty awesome if Bill Nye types taught classes.
03-05-2018T18:58:45,CrRAR,Imagine if all professors were THAT zany?
03-05-2018T18:59:14,CrRAR,Pretty sure they'd have to bolt shut all high windows on campus.
03-05-2018T19:01:25,Vatruvius,I do not understand what you are referencing with the windows but more Bill Nye type professors would be awesome. Boring subjects would not be boring!
03-05-2018T19:03:18,CrRAR,"Yeah, creating an engaging learning experience is tougher than it seems, it requires such comfort with the material to be so dynamic among it. They have to have passion for the subject to teach it with passion."
03-05-2018T19:04:13,Vatruvius,"I do not doubt my professor here has passion for the subject of environmental studies, she just does not have that zing Bill Nye has."
03-05-2018T19:05:04,Vatruvius,I think the type of people we are looking for here are people who are passionate about the subject and are passionate about teaching it to others.
03-05-2018T19:16:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill
03-05-2018T19:17:12,SpazztasticKiwi,After last night I looked through my horror collection
03-05-2018T19:17:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a strange number of R rated with nudity
03-05-2018T19:17:42,Vatruvius,"No, Kiwi! You made my mind go right back to Mark playing Hunie Pop"
03-05-2018T19:18:16,Vatruvius,"That is a problem Kiwi, now I cannot look at you the same."
03-05-2018T19:18:21,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
03-05-2018T19:18:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you seen him play that game with the wacky boob physics?
03-05-2018T19:19:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a really pervy game and he keeps yelling ‚ÄúI have a girlfriend‚Äù
03-05-2018T19:19:50,Vatruvius,"Yeah, typical Japanese game boob physics."
03-05-2018T19:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the virtual chick can hear him
03-05-2018T19:20:35,Vatruvius,Did I read you saying earlier something about ComicCon 2019?
03-05-2018T19:20:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Funny thing with horror: they lure you in with the boobs
03-05-2018T19:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,And yeah. I‚Äôm thinking of prepping to go
03-05-2018T19:21:45,Vatruvius,When is it next year?
03-05-2018T19:25:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"No clue. That‚Äôs part of the prep part, though I suspect it‚Äôs in the same month every year"
03-05-2018T19:26:11,Vatruvius,So around about a year from now. Do you know where it will be?
03-05-2018T19:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,San Diego‚Äôs usually where
03-05-2018T19:27:45,Vatruvius,"Ohh, local for me then."
03-05-2018T19:29:17,Vatruvius,In-state anyway.
03-05-2018T19:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not 100% sure but I believe Tom said he won‚Äôt be to this year‚Äôs anyway
03-05-2018T19:31:49,Vatruvius,"Hmm, probably thought I do not know."
03-05-2018T19:32:19,Vatruvius,Didn't even think if Tom would be there but it would make sense. I just thought it would be cool to go to one. That or PAX.
03-05-2018T19:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,PAX is hectic
03-05-2018T19:33:06,SpazztasticKiwi,East is crowded and it‚Äôs not likely you‚Äôll run into someone you know
03-05-2018T19:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mark has to stay back stage anymore because he‚Äôs too easily recognized and mobbed, and it seems Jack may be joining him next year because he got mobbed on the last day when he tried going out on the floor without a costume"
03-05-2018T19:35:45,Vatruvius,"I was not even thinking about doing that, just to check it out. Maybe go to an Acquisitions Incorporated thing, but mostly to check it out."
03-05-2018T19:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a lot of game creators and animatiors and the like that go too. I met about 7 animators while there and we talked for about 2 hours
03-05-2018T19:39:48,Vatruvius,"Huh...animators as in those people that post those animation videos of other youtubers, movies, games, etc.?"
03-05-2018T19:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah the Tubers and such are a smaller part considering
03-05-2018T19:40:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Some do game animation though too
03-05-2018T19:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Rather than just YouTubers animations that is
03-05-2018T19:42:09,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs also tabletop games like D&D shows and stuff and an entire area for experimental/unreleased tabletop and board games you can try
03-05-2018T19:43:41,Vatruvius,From what I heard PAX has pretty much everything and a lot of it.
03-05-2018T19:43:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty much
03-05-2018T19:44:27,Vatruvius,"But ComicCon, a custom is practically required isn't?"
03-05-2018T19:44:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Custom?
03-05-2018T19:44:45,Vatruvius,Costume*
03-05-2018T19:45:04,Bgrmystr2,costumes are not required for ANY convention
03-05-2018T19:45:12,Bgrmystr2,I don't know why you would think so
03-05-2018T19:45:29,Bgrmystr2,but people do make them and do wear them
03-05-2018T19:45:39,Bgrmystr2,so it's common to see them
03-05-2018T19:46:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt costumes are required
03-05-2018T19:46:15,Vatruvius,"I know it is not required, but it is a really big thing at ComicCon is seems. Like, you would be in the minority without a costume."
03-05-2018T19:46:28,Bgrmystr2,"actually no, you wouldn't be"
03-05-2018T19:46:40,Vatruvius,The more you know.
03-05-2018T19:46:46,Bgrmystr2,the people who don't wear costumes far outnumber the people who do wear them
03-05-2018T19:47:16,Bgrmystr2,for most it's just not something they can afford. not everyone wants to be in costume either. they just want to enjoy the con
03-05-2018T19:47:16,Vatruvius,"I know, I would go as...myself! Haha!"
03-05-2018T19:47:50,totallynotTrace,"bgr right. statisticaly costumes are the minority but because they draw attention your brain focus's on them more and tends to ignore the ""normal"" people with stuff like t-shirts"
03-05-2018T19:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll go as a serial killer. They look like everyone else
03-05-2018T19:48:00,Bgrmystr2,"there's so many pictures and videos of many cons all over the world, and costumes are a small percentage"
03-05-2018T19:48:12,CrRAR,"Yeah, it's just that a majority of the pictures that come out of ComicCon are ones of people in costumes swaying people's perception.... probably."
03-05-2018T19:48:17,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, nottrace is right, they just get more attention /because/ they are costumes"
03-05-2018T19:48:37,Vatruvius,I see.
03-05-2018T19:48:49,CrRAR,confirmation biasssss
03-05-2018T19:48:55,Bgrmystr2,"of the few hundred people who wear costumes in a single day, you're looking at THOUSANDS of people who do not."
03-05-2018T19:49:12,totallynotTrace,and you wouldnt take as many pictures of people in off the shelf clothing but you would of home made cosplay
03-05-2018T19:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"If costumes are required, what‚Äôs Tom been dressing up as for SDCC?"
03-05-2018T19:49:28,CrRAR,The people out of costumes are where ALL those pictures COME from.
03-05-2018T19:49:49,Bgrmystr2,"that's his secret, kiwi. He's always in costume :V"
03-05-2018T19:49:50,CrRAR,:ptv-shock:
03-05-2018T19:50:20,CrRAR,The greatest bamboozle
03-05-2018T19:50:29,Vatruvius,lol
03-05-2018T19:50:44,SpazztasticKiwi,His costume is ‚ÄúSuffering Artist‚Äù
03-05-2018T19:52:17,Vatruvius,Ouch.
03-05-2018T19:53:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I was gonna say ‚ÄúHermit‚Äù. Would that be better?
03-05-2018T19:53:43,totallynotTrace,idk. does tom leave his computer?
03-05-2018T19:53:59,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs not online now
03-05-2018T19:54:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Besides, I mean suffering in that he seems to never feel he‚Äôs getting stuff done. And allergies"
03-05-2018T19:54:59,BadFoMo,That means that his power and/or internet is out.
03-05-2018T19:55:07,totallynotTrace,"WAIT, YOUR SAYING TOM ISNT A ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE?! HES AN ACTUAL CORPORIAL BEING?!"
03-05-2018T19:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nah, he‚Äôs just at his charge port"
03-05-2018T19:55:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Refueling

03-05-2018T20:20:54,Ordithus,Ducks also float... therefore witches are ducks?

03-05-2018T20:32:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,TDM is the dragon masquerade
03-05-2018T20:32:15,MrRetroRealm,I actually grew a pair and watched a motion comic version of Twokinds
03-05-2018T20:32:15,Combak,"Well, now people know what to suggest for Sunday. XD"

03-05-2018T20:32:59,MrRetroRealm,"Yeah, someone made one, voices aren't half bad, you can tell they're trying"
03-05-2018T20:33:09,Vatruvius,A motion comic huh... :thinking:

03-05-2018T20:33:17,Bgrmystr2,like everyone else xD
03-05-2018T20:33:21,MrRetroRealm,Not really a motion comic.
03-05-2018T20:33:24,unsteddyphoenix,Why would you watch a comic. Comics are the easiest things to read
03-05-2018T20:33:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I drink it
03-05-2018T20:33:30,Vatruvius,"I would just read it, but I mean if they want to do it."
03-05-2018T20:33:31,MrRetroRealm,I am not reading a ton of chapters
03-05-2018T20:33:32,Bgrmystr2,Don't be like marv lol

03-05-2018T20:33:33,BadFoMo,@Combak That reminds me to ask if my 'May-Turnaty' request will be ok.

03-05-2018T20:33:59,MrRetroRealm,I'm not sure if it should even qualify as a motion comic.
03-05-2018T20:34:00,Vatruvius,Audiobooks do not make sense for comics thought.
03-05-2018T20:34:20,MrRetroRealm,It's just labeled as such
03-05-2018T20:34:20,Bgrmystr2,"people take comics, and use a bit of photoshop to make it seem like it moves w/ voices and sound effects.."
03-05-2018T20:34:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, a comic page has, what, 5 lines of dialogue on average?"
03-05-2018T20:34:31,MrRetroRealm,There was not motion
03-05-2018T20:34:32,unsteddyphoenix,YOu really need those READ to you?

03-05-2018T23:21:51,CrRAR,lol

03-05-2018T23:22:38,Twokinds,Euchre might not have sided with Trace if he'd been aware he had a daughter.

03-05-2018T23:26:16,CrimsonHelsing,Ohhh that Sirus is a sonofabitch
03-05-2018T23:26:21,ZRO4825,"Damnit, Bgr, you're failing at your precognition rolls again..."
03-05-2018T23:26:24,unsteddyphoenix,"So they originally had a full consensus, but now that Trace is mindcrushed they're conflicted..."
03-05-2018T23:26:30,w0lfmare,I'm glad we're finally getting into some of it in the comic
03-05-2018T23:26:31,Dadrobit,"Hm, I always assumed that part of the reason Euchre took part in Trace's regime was to ensure that at least Mary wasn't killed."
03-05-2018T23:26:45,Bgrmystr2,"Sorry I, unlike others here, am not omnicient."

03-05-2018T23:27:45,Ordithus,"It was, robit"
03-05-2018T23:27:46,Twokinds,There's a lot that's hard to tell
03-05-2018T23:27:55,Twokinds,Without giving a huge flashback story dump
03-05-2018T23:27:57,Ordithus,But it seems it's more complex than we knew
03-05-2018T23:28:00,unsteddyphoenix,I bet I wanna knoooow~
03-05-2018T23:28:04,Twokinds,Maybe someday I'll do a history sidecomic.

03-05-2018T23:29:04,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps you could put it in the future of the comic, tom"
03-05-2018T23:29:07,ZRO4825,Sage. This looks hot. :3

03-05-2018T23:32:11,unsteddyphoenix,Not that I remember...
03-05-2018T23:32:15,CrRAR,I may be mistaken.
03-05-2018T23:32:21,Dadrobit,"Nope, never appeared so far."
03-05-2018T23:32:45,Dadrobit,"Though, I do have a hteory that the old man Euchre met after he was injured ~may~ have been him."
03-05-2018T23:32:49,Dadrobit,theory*
03-05-2018T23:33:04,CrRAR,ahh
03-05-2018T23:33:19,Bgrmystr2,"naw fairly sure the mage has never appeared beyond the one page that shows them all, http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/409/"
03-05-2018T23:33:25,PillowPrincessDRAWS,"Two kinds is closest to cell shading at the moment due to the high lights. :) the rest of it is soft and reserved colors that help with the depth of the scene~ ^^ regardless of technique, tis a beautiful technique~"
03-05-2018T23:33:30,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/242/
03-05-2018T23:33:58,w0lfmare,I'm a big fan of mixing sell and soft shading
03-05-2018T23:34:03,PillowPrincessDRAWS,XD
03-05-2018T23:34:05,w0lfmare,*Cell
03-05-2018T23:34:06,PillowPrincessDRAWS,ditto
03-05-2018T23:34:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"give me some of that ""Hard"" shading"
03-05-2018T23:34:21,PillowPrincessDRAWS,it makes more of a 3D effect
03-05-2018T23:34:25,unsteddyphoenix,"When I think of cell shading I think of like, borderlands"
03-05-2018T23:34:26,PillowPrincessDRAWS,oh my~
03-05-2018T23:34:34,Bgrmystr2,"Same, phoenix"

03-05-2018T23:34:38,Bgrmystr2,and this isn't anywhere close
03-05-2018T23:34:57,PillowPrincessDRAWS,"oh, tooning?"
03-05-2018T23:35:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah like, making it look flat."
03-05-2018T23:35:22,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt that what it is?
03-05-2018T23:35:33,Bgrmystr2,"""Tooning"" :thinking:"
03-05-2018T23:35:33,Dadrobit,"Huh, the advertisments on the TK page have been taken over by a local Amber Alert. That's prettty cool."
03-05-2018T23:36:41,CrimsonHelsing,that's rather alarming
03-05-2018T23:36:44,CrimsonHelsing,or... idk
03-05-2018T23:36:46,PillowPrincessDRAWS,they created 3-Dimensional characters and created weighted lines along the planes of the model
03-05-2018T23:36:48,PillowPrincessDRAWS,:3
03-05-2018T23:36:58,PillowPrincessDRAWS,They did awesome at it to!
03-05-2018T23:37:12,Twokinds,"Alarming? Don't you mean, alerting?"
03-05-2018T23:37:20,PillowPrincessDRAWS,giving it an awesome comic book feel ^0^

03-05-2018T23:39:03,Vatruvius,Question 2 of 5 done.
03-05-2018T23:39:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I was talking about Tom

03-05-2018T23:41:00,CrimsonHelsing,Hey! who turned out the lights?!
03-05-2018T23:41:33,SpazztasticKiwi,You sure do it most often
03-05-2018T23:41:44,Bgrmystr2,Sometimes it's easy to dismiss something that is obviously false lol
03-05-2018T23:42:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Like you‚Äôre doing now
03-05-2018T23:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,No body is right but you
03-05-2018T23:42:17,CrimsonHelsing,*bzzt* Hey! Who turned out the lights?!

03-05-2018T23:43:11,Twokinds,So many abs
03-05-2018T23:43:30,SpazztasticKiwi,If I just lurk it can still be seen
03-05-2018T23:43:32,unsteddyphoenix,The thighs though
03-05-2018T23:43:36,CrimsonHelsing,*bzzt* Hey! Who turned out the lights?! *bzzt* Hey! Who turned out the lights?!
03-05-2018T23:43:38,unsteddyphoenix,So many watermelons to crush

03-05-2018T23:43:45,ZRO4825,Serena's always great to look at. =D

03-05-2018T23:44:15,CrimsonHelsing,oh God xD
03-05-2018T23:44:17,ZRO4825,I thought Serena was the point of this image? :thinking:
03-05-2018T23:44:34,Bgrmystr2,"It probably is, Zro"
03-05-2018T23:44:36,CrimsonHelsing,Serena? sorry I'm not watching both streams if this is in the other
03-05-2018T23:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I see your ‚Äúpoint‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt exist
03-05-2018T23:44:43,Bgrmystr2,"Maybe you should, Crimson"
03-05-2018T23:44:53,Bgrmystr2,then zoom it went.
03-05-2018T23:45:06,CrimsonHelsing,why should I? :v
03-05-2018T23:45:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Even lurking it can be clearly seen that you dismiss a lot of others‚Äô comments and options
03-05-2018T23:45:26,Bgrmystr2,"Because Tom is not the only one streaming here, Crimson"
03-05-2018T23:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And opinios
03-05-2018T23:45:41,CrimsonHelsing,but he's the one I'm here to watch :V
03-05-2018T23:45:44,SpazztasticKiwi,*opinions
03-05-2018T23:46:19,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
03-05-2018T23:46:22,Bgrmystr2,"And that's great. Maybe you should watch sage too, maybe you might like what he does as well :V"
03-05-2018T23:46:28,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll ever acknowledge or admit to it so
03-05-2018T23:46:32,Bgrmystr2,"Or Ron, or Nero when he comes in"
03-05-2018T23:46:35,Twokinds,"I decided to experiment with a different way of rendering shadows this time, and it's quite a challenge."
03-05-2018T23:46:41,ZRO4825,Ron's stuff is awesome.
03-05-2018T23:46:50,CrimsonHelsing,more difficult @Twokinds?
03-05-2018T23:46:59,ZRO4825,"I'd say the same of Sage's, but I'm obviously biased there anyway. :3"
03-05-2018T23:47:01,SpazztasticKiwi,That red is so deep Sage
03-05-2018T23:47:01,Bgrmystr2,"Like I said, Kiwi. Lurk more. Calling me out personally when everyone else does it too"
03-05-2018T23:47:08,Bgrmystr2,rude pls.
03-05-2018T23:47:17,Dadrobit,":/ Okay, something is definitely up with Keenspot ads. Second time I've been hit with a malicious pop-up."
03-05-2018T23:47:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I will not lurk because you don‚Äôt like what you see
03-05-2018T23:47:24,unsteddyphoenix,Like in the background?
03-05-2018T23:47:43,Dadrobit,Screenshotted it this time and sent it off to the Keenspot email. Hopefully they look into this BS.
03-05-2018T23:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe crimson is the better color name tho
03-05-2018T23:47:46,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"what do you mean, dadro? I haven't gotten any ads"
03-05-2018T23:47:46,RH0DE,ive gotten some too
03-05-2018T23:47:54,Twokinds,"No, the background I just painted."
03-05-2018T23:47:56,RH0DE,theye are weird
03-05-2018T23:48:00,SpazztasticKiwi,She looks niiiice
03-05-2018T23:48:05,unsteddyphoenix,Ah Is ee I see
03-05-2018T23:48:20,Dadrobit,"I don't wanna have to turn on th the adblock on TwoKinds, but I'd rather not risk my computer tbh."
03-05-2018T23:48:29,RH0DE,same
03-05-2018T23:48:43,Twokinds,"Yeah, I'm disappointed in Keenspot's ad quality. I don't know what's going on with them."
03-05-2018T23:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,A lot more sites are adding ads
03-05-2018T23:49:01,CrRAR,it's like subtractive shadowing?
03-05-2018T23:49:04,CrimsonHelsing,"eh, Sage Nero and Ron *shrug* it's a roll of the dice with them for me xP"
03-05-2018T23:49:05,Ordithus,I hope they fix it. I hate adblocking comics
03-05-2018T23:49:10,CrRAR,seems challenging.
03-05-2018T23:49:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately
03-05-2018T23:49:29,Twokinds,"I usually use a multiply layer, but this time I'm using a hard light mask"
03-05-2018T23:49:43,CrRAR,ah
03-05-2018T23:49:44,RH0DE,neat
03-05-2018T23:49:47,Dadrobit,Permission to post link of offending ad?
03-05-2018T23:49:48,CrimsonHelsing,"seems to be local, the ad problem. I'm getting ads up the wazoo for TwoKinds and some other things"
03-05-2018T23:50:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tutorial pls 0_o
03-05-2018T23:50:04,Dadrobit,screenshot of course.
03-05-2018T23:50:06,Twokinds,Don't post it here
03-05-2018T23:50:11,Dadrobit,lol
03-05-2018T23:50:13,Twokinds,Just send it to keenspot please
03-05-2018T23:50:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, already did."
03-05-2018T23:50:23,Twokinds,I will message keenspot myself and try and figure out what's going on
03-05-2018T23:50:44,PillowPrincessDRAWS,Grr gotta go to bed now... Have a good night doves! I shall cuddle my lady! ^^

03-05-2018T23:51:07,Dadrobit,"Sent a message the first time, but I didn't have a screen of it then and gave some benefit of the doubt that it was maybe on my end."

03-05-2018T23:51:21,SageSaga,yo Zoie
03-05-2018T23:51:32,ZoieFalcona,:D
03-05-2018T23:51:32,CrimsonHelsing,it's possibly local @Dadrobit
03-05-2018T23:51:46,ZRO4825,Heyyo Zoie
03-05-2018T23:51:55,ZoieFalcona,Hello Zro :)
03-05-2018T23:52:11,tailsysmods,Hi
03-05-2018T23:52:19,Ordithus,Unfortunately I think it's one of the google or whatever ads... not something Keenspot has direct control over
03-05-2018T23:52:27,Vexd,"""We just haphazardly throw whatever ads we're  given and post them to our hosted comics!"""
03-05-2018T23:52:28,Dadrobit,"But after a complete scan of my PC and having it happen only on the TK site in the exact same way, in addition to hearing others with the same malicious ads, I'm seriously doubting it's just me."
03-05-2018T23:52:37,Vexd,It's not
03-05-2018T23:52:56,CrimsonHelsing,I didn't say isolated to *one* area
03-05-2018T23:52:58,RH0DE,"welp, gotta go"
03-05-2018T23:53:03,Dadrobit,Cya Rode
03-05-2018T23:53:06,CrimsonHelsing,"there are tons of ""locals"" everywhere"
03-05-2018T23:53:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya Rhode
03-05-2018T23:53:08,Dadrobit,Rhode*
03-05-2018T23:53:08,Ordithus,"Yeah, I got something like that the other week from keenspot as soon as I disabled adblock on it :ptv-uneasy:"
03-05-2018T23:53:17,w0lfmare,That's not how ads work Vex
03-05-2018T23:53:41,Vexd,Neat
03-05-2018T23:54:19,Vexd,Doesn't make them any more pleasant
03-05-2018T23:54:25,w0lfmare,"It's likely either a problem with Keenspot's filter settings, or a problem with Google's ad filtering quality"
03-05-2018T23:54:44,CrimsonHelsing,"kinda tempted to close War Thunder and dip back into Minecraft for old times sake. windowed mode anyway, and I like watching this stream, the music is banging too"
03-05-2018T23:54:45,Vatruvius,One question to go!
03-05-2018T23:54:52,CrRAR,:oO
03-05-2018T23:54:54,CrimsonHelsing,stream music I mean
03-05-2018T23:54:54,w0lfmare,"Can't say for sure, since I'm not as familiar with google's ad services as much as others"
03-05-2018T23:55:19,Ordithus,Does your comic host directly host the ads?
03-05-2018T23:55:28,Ordithus,That typed out weird...
03-05-2018T23:55:44,Dadrobit,The link update on the bottom left of the page looks like it was tryig to pass itself off as an Amazon ad.
03-05-2018T23:55:56,w0lfmare,Me? I have to do all the ads myself
03-05-2018T23:56:24,Ordithus,"Time consuming, but safer"
03-05-2018T23:56:39,unsteddyphoenix,Im just getting targeted razor ads 'cause I bought one recently
03-05-2018T23:58:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,raine face
