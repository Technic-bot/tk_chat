08-04-2018T00:00:43,Vatruvius,I have a question for you...I got a cool sketch idea that I think would be really sweat but it has to do with Laura's urn...will that be coming up later in the comic?
08-04-2018T00:08:35,DarthKeidran,Anybody still here if I might ask?
08-04-2018T00:09:52,DarthKeidran,Next time then.
08-04-2018T00:10:04,Vatruvius,Still here.
08-04-2018T00:16:15,Twokinds,Uh...
08-04-2018T00:17:26,Twokinds,"Well, I don't know what the suggestion is specifically, but probably"
08-04-2018T00:18:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re not at comic con this year, will you be next year?"
08-04-2018T00:19:07,Vatruvius,Figured as much...my suggestion will be a spoiler then. Well...I can cross that one off the list.
08-04-2018T00:19:52,TorqueEmUp,"I think Tom said yes to Comicon, and maybe for AC."
08-04-2018T00:20:17,Vatruvius,Tom is attending Comicon this year but to go to it not set up a booth right?
08-04-2018T00:20:45,Vatruvius,I will be right back...gotta restart my computer.
08-04-2018T00:24:00,Vatruvius,And...I am back.
08-04-2018T00:25:14,Dadrobit,Back. Tried a new place in town. Ericbertos. Got some tacos. They were pretty good.
08-04-2018T00:25:44,unsteddyphoenix,That name absolutely sounds made up
08-04-2018T00:25:48,unsteddyphoenix,Also do you only eat mexican food?
08-04-2018T00:26:08,Dadrobit,"No, sometimes I eat other foods."
08-04-2018T00:26:55,Vatruvius,"Dadro: ""But mostly Mexican food."""

08-04-2018T00:27:55,Dadrobit,"Like, I don't have enchiladas for breakfast or anything."
08-04-2018T00:28:47,Dadrobit,"Sorry, I did make up the name. It's actually Erikberto's."
08-04-2018T00:33:01,unsteddyphoenix,I am a master prosecutor
08-04-2018T00:33:22,unsteddyphoenix,Never any bacon and egg burritos for breakfast
08-04-2018T00:33:32,unsteddyphoenix,To go with the fishstick dinners?
08-04-2018T00:34:05,Dadrobit,I suppose I'm never living that one down huh?
08-04-2018T00:35:14,unsteddyphoenix,I only regret losing the evidence
08-04-2018T00:35:32,Vatruvius,Well goodnight guys...maybe I will come back later but for now...goodnight! :ptv-greetings:

08-04-2018T00:37:55,Dadrobit,"Yours is east unsteddy, it's already spelt wrong. If my spellchecker gives your name a red line, I know I've got it right."
08-04-2018T00:37:59,Dadrobit,easy*
08-04-2018T00:38:22,Dadrobit,My spelling is truly shitting the bed tonight.
08-04-2018T00:38:28,Dadrobit,I blame the tacos.
08-04-2018T00:38:38,unsteddyphoenix,Lol

08-04-2018T00:49:57,unsteddyphoenix,Do you keep your 6-shooter handy just in case?
08-04-2018T00:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Tf you on a diet for
08-04-2018T00:50:35,Dadrobit,More than six shots m8
08-04-2018T00:51:12,unsteddyphoenix,How dare you not conform to stereotypes
08-04-2018T00:51:15,Dadrobit,Though I do in fact have a S&W .38 Special which I guess is 6 shots
08-04-2018T00:51:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t your weight pretty healthy for your age and height
08-04-2018T00:51:25,Dadrobit,But it's not my main carry
08-04-2018T00:51:32,TorqueEmUp,diets are for fat people
08-04-2018T00:51:38,TorqueEmUp,:P
08-04-2018T00:51:41,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
08-04-2018T00:51:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea gun talk
08-04-2018T00:52:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Need to get me one of those
08-04-2018T00:53:07,TorqueEmUp,Just got myself a Taurus PT111 G2C the a couple days ago. 9mm 12+1
08-04-2018T00:54:06,Dadrobit,Haven't gotten a gun in forever.
08-04-2018T00:54:10,TheBeckoner,I went skeet shooting recently. Loads of fun.
08-04-2018T00:54:52,Dadrobit,"I'm super split on weather I want to get a 1911 next, or get a proper AR15."
08-04-2018T00:54:58,Dadrobit,whether*
08-04-2018T00:55:10,TheBeckoner,Ooh tough split.
08-04-2018T00:55:15,TorqueEmUp,"Glad I ordered it when I did, the day after I picked it up, they went up $100"
08-04-2018T00:55:28,TheBeckoner,I'd go for  a 1911 if it were me
08-04-2018T00:55:57,unsteddyphoenix,Youre supposed to have a revolver
08-04-2018T00:56:10,Dadrobit,"I already have two pistols, but I also already have an AK for rifle fun."
08-04-2018T00:56:17,unsteddyphoenix,"How do you guys feel about the gun control movement, out of curiosity?"
08-04-2018T00:56:26,Dadrobit,"I do have a revolver, it's the .38 special."
08-04-2018T00:56:46,unsteddyphoenix,oo nice
08-04-2018T00:57:06,Twokinds,I just want to lose a little before a con I'm going to in a month.
08-04-2018T00:57:17,Dadrobit,Doing plenty of cruches?
08-04-2018T00:57:21,Dadrobit,crunches*
08-04-2018T00:57:27,TheBeckoner,I feel like its a people problem not a gun problem. Gotta change the people first. Item bans only go so far
08-04-2018T00:57:40,Dadrobit,Beck is correct.
08-04-2018T00:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,“Loose a little in a month”
08-04-2018T00:58:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Good luck with that
08-04-2018T00:58:27,Dadrobit,"But people are swayed by cute cat videos, so more stuff will get ""banned"" and make them feel safer until the next nutjob shows up."
08-04-2018T00:58:31,TheBeckoner,Funny you mention that though Phoenix. I gotta give a speech on it tomorrow.
08-04-2018T00:58:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, he said a ""little"""
08-04-2018T00:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Gonna take some effort
08-04-2018T00:58:53,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah im pretty swayed by cute cat videos in general
08-04-2018T00:58:53,Twokinds,Yeah I figure if I just don't eat for a month it'll be a piece of cake
08-04-2018T00:58:54,TheBeckoner,"It comes in waves, banning a bit more each time."
08-04-2018T00:58:57,Twokinds,"Mmm, cake"
08-04-2018T00:59:01,Dadrobit,Lol
08-04-2018T00:59:09,TorqueEmUp,Starving yourself never works
08-04-2018T00:59:11,unsteddyphoenix,That will go well
08-04-2018T00:59:15,TorqueEmUp,weight will always come back
08-04-2018T00:59:16,unsteddyphoenix,I can tell
08-04-2018T00:59:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Might be a problem with a month long fast
08-04-2018T00:59:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Just a guess
08-04-2018T00:59:26,TheBeckoner,I'll take what you lose lol. Need to gain some weight.
08-04-2018T00:59:35,Dadrobit,Pls take mine too.
08-04-2018T00:59:35,unsteddyphoenix,Same
08-04-2018T00:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,My last 10 pounds need a new home. Take them
08-04-2018T01:00:00,TheBeckoner,Sure lol. I want like 150-160 So I need like 20lbs plz
08-04-2018T01:00:01,unsteddyphoenix,Sure guys no prob
08-04-2018T01:00:22,unsteddyphoenix,Chuck 'em over
08-04-2018T01:00:29,unsteddyphoenix,Wouldnt it be nice if we could do that~
08-04-2018T01:00:35,TheBeckoner,Yeah
08-04-2018T01:00:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish I could shift weight around to where I wanted
08-04-2018T01:01:06,Dadrobit,I hate the fact that I let myself take someone else's weight.
08-04-2018T01:01:13,TorqueEmUp,I wish we could just freely control our metabolisms
08-04-2018T01:01:16,Dadrobit,S'the only way it happens right?
08-04-2018T01:01:17,TheBeckoner,I've been eating a ton of food and weight lifting but Im not seeing much in the weight area...
08-04-2018T01:01:25,TheBeckoner,geetin stronger tho
08-04-2018T01:01:29,TheBeckoner,gettin*
08-04-2018T01:01:36,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta get dat protein powder
08-04-2018T01:01:41,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what im gonna do this time
08-04-2018T01:01:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t know how weight gain works for guys so can’t help there
08-04-2018T01:02:10,Twokinds,Imagine if you really could pay people to take your weight for you.
08-04-2018T01:02:20,TheBeckoner,I weigh 137 atm and Ive been eating a gram per pound nearly every day. I think that's pretty good?
08-04-2018T01:02:28,Dadrobit,"It's called a good personal trainer, Tom."
08-04-2018T01:02:35,unsteddyphoenix,"Get other peoples weight, then just work it off"
08-04-2018T01:02:38,Twokinds,"Like, you could get rich if you were just willing to get really fat and then work it off for them."
08-04-2018T01:02:39,unsteddyphoenix,I could do that
08-04-2018T01:02:52,TheBeckoner,I would also do that
08-04-2018T01:02:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I weigh more than you. That helps my outlook
08-04-2018T01:04:00,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt there an actor that like
08-04-2018T01:04:17,unsteddyphoenix,Gains and loses absurd amounts of weight in short periods of time for roles
08-04-2018T01:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,You jogging Tom or just dieting
08-04-2018T01:04:38,Dadrobit,I know there was a guy who did it for The Pianist
08-04-2018T01:04:47,Dadrobit,I believe that was the name of the movie.
08-04-2018T01:04:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Or is jogging in Cincinnati not advisable
08-04-2018T01:05:05,Dadrobit,"Also, hardcore method acting is dumb, just putting that out there."
08-04-2018T01:05:29,unsteddyphoenix,Ah christian bale
08-04-2018T01:05:33,unsteddyphoenix,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOxUklPXcAA5e6E.jpg
08-04-2018T01:06:00,TorqueEmUp,*sees scrawny people complaining about weight* Well I am out :P
08-04-2018T01:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,That kinda reminds me - I got to watch the first 30ish minutes of Thor ragnorock
08-04-2018T01:06:28,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, such a fun movie"
08-04-2018T01:06:48,unsteddyphoenix,Normally with movies you want to watch the whole thing
08-04-2018T01:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,The sass on the beginning is what kept my attention
08-04-2018T01:07:12,TheBeckoner,That was a pretty good movie imo
08-04-2018T01:07:21,unsteddyphoenix,"As tired as I am of superhero movies, I enjoyed it"
08-04-2018T01:07:39,unsteddyphoenix,The rock guy is such a classic kiwi guy I loved him
08-04-2018T01:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Rock guy?
08-04-2018T01:08:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Dwane Johnson?
08-04-2018T01:08:27,Dadrobit,He comes a bit later than 30 minutes I think
08-04-2018T01:08:29,Dadrobit,LOL
08-04-2018T01:08:45,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
08-04-2018T01:08:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Still talking about the movie, ok, not actors"
08-04-2018T01:08:52,Dadrobit,"No, literal rock guy, not The Rock."
08-04-2018T01:09:00,unsteddyphoenix,"The Rock, man that was the wrestling golden age."
08-04-2018T01:09:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Not into wrestling
08-04-2018T01:09:18,Dadrobit,The Rock was the first wrestler I ever saw when I was a kid.
08-04-2018T01:09:23,TheBeckoner,Y'all should look up Paul anderson.
08-04-2018T01:09:25,unsteddyphoenix,The peoples elbow was a straight up spirit bomb
08-04-2018T01:09:30,TheBeckoner,super cool dude
08-04-2018T01:09:33,Dadrobit,Was a hardcore match between him and another legend who's name I forget.
08-04-2018T01:09:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Too much muscle isn’t attractive
08-04-2018T01:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And isn’t always healthy
08-04-2018T01:09:57,Dadrobit,He had handcuffed the other guy to the ropes and was smashing him with a folding chair.
08-04-2018T01:10:06,Dadrobit,Lots of blood.
08-04-2018T01:10:11,Dadrobit,I was hooked for a few years.
08-04-2018T01:10:39,unsteddyphoenix,I watched some. One of the few games for ps2 I originally had was a wrestling game.
08-04-2018T01:11:25,Dadrobit,Mick Foley!
08-04-2018T01:11:55,TheBeckoner,The ground fighting in judo is sorta like wrestling. I always like it better than stand up. Never really in wrestling tho
08-04-2018T01:11:59,unsteddyphoenix,Was that the guy with the mask?
08-04-2018T01:12:02,TheBeckoner,liked*
08-04-2018T01:12:09,TheBeckoner,into*
08-04-2018T01:12:16,TheBeckoner,lol tire me no spell
08-04-2018T01:12:20,TheBeckoner,wow
08-04-2018T01:12:22,TheBeckoner,tired*
08-04-2018T01:13:36,TheBeckoner,"Welp Im gonna go to bed. Got a busy day tomorrow, speech to give and  hopefully a job interview. Night y'all"
08-04-2018T01:13:54,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he was wearing a mask at the time"
08-04-2018T01:13:59,unsteddyphoenix,"later, have fun~"
08-04-2018T01:14:04,Dadrobit,cya beck
08-04-2018T01:14:11,unsteddyphoenix,I think I vaguely remember him...
08-04-2018T01:14:19,unsteddyphoenix,Was he like a daredevil
08-04-2018T01:16:03,Dadrobit,He was very into hardcore stuff.
08-04-2018T01:18:04,Dadrobit,He ended up taking 11 chair shots to the head while he was handcuffed.
08-04-2018T01:18:41,unsteddyphoenix,"god damn, how did he survive~"
08-04-2018T01:19:14,Dadrobit,Listening to a podcast about it now.
08-04-2018T01:20:02,Dadrobit,"It was agreed upon that they would do 5 chair shots and by then he'd be halfway up the alley towards backstage. But when 5 came, he was still in the ring, so The Rock just kept going at it."
08-04-2018T01:21:02,unsteddyphoenix,lol
08-04-2018T01:21:04,Dadrobit,It was a really brutal match.
08-04-2018T01:21:13,unsteddyphoenix,so he improved getting whaled on?
08-04-2018T01:21:17,unsteddyphoenix,*improv'd
08-04-2018T01:21:29,Dadrobit,Especially considering I remember rather well 20 years later.
08-04-2018T01:22:21,Dadrobit,"Foley is talking about how his mind just went into, ""I am Mankind, I am the character, the character can take it."" So he did to try and play up The Rock having a ""savage"" side."
08-04-2018T01:22:54,Dadrobit,"Which is what the match was trying to portray as before then, The Rock was just a cool dude."
08-04-2018T01:23:12,Dadrobit,"He'd never been a ""mean"" character before then, so they were trying to establish that."
08-04-2018T01:23:39,unsteddyphoenix,Every wrestler had turns being a heel or a face occasionally right?
08-04-2018T01:23:45,unsteddyphoenix,Didnt watch much but I think that's how it worked
08-04-2018T01:23:54,Dadrobit,More or less.
08-04-2018T01:24:18,Dadrobit,Stopped watching in mid-2000's.
08-04-2018T01:26:49,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/QXmyl8a.gif
08-04-2018T01:27:11,Dadrobit,He just kept getting back up
08-04-2018T01:29:57,Dadrobit,"As an adult, I think if that was my first match seeing what wrestling was, I don't think I'd continue watching."
08-04-2018T01:29:57,unsteddyphoenix,"I never watched consistently, just watched what I could"
08-04-2018T01:30:13,unsteddyphoenix,"I remember he jumped from like, a steel cage onto a tale full of thumbtacks"
08-04-2018T01:30:26,unsteddyphoenix,the mask guy
08-04-2018T01:30:31,unsteddyphoenix,Actually painful seeming stuff
08-04-2018T01:30:37,Dadrobit,I watched it with my egg-doner on weekends at her house.
08-04-2018T01:30:55,Dadrobit,So I only got partial viewership myself.
08-04-2018T01:31:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, this guy was legit doing harmful stuff."
08-04-2018T01:31:50,Dadrobit,"He's talking about how it affected his life, and even more his children's life."
08-04-2018T01:39:00,unsteddyphoenix,Damn
08-04-2018T01:39:02,unsteddyphoenix,but he like
08-04-2018T01:39:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Made the choice to do it, didnt he?"
08-04-2018T01:39:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was the job. That was the character he created for himself."
08-04-2018T01:40:09,Dadrobit,But in the podcast he was talking about how much he regretted letting it get so far out of hand.
08-04-2018T02:00:58,Dadrobit,"Alright, I don't think I'm getting much sleep tonight. Probably just gonna work on my project until class tomorrow."
08-04-2018T02:01:04,Dadrobit,So I'm only kinda here now.
08-04-2018T02:02:24,unsteddyphoenix,\o/ sleep is for nerds good luck.
08-04-2018T02:02:48,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
08-04-2018T02:02:52,Twokinds,What a nerd
08-04-2018T02:03:03,Dadrobit,:O
08-04-2018T02:03:21,unsteddyphoenix,Exhibit A
08-04-2018T02:03:37,Dadrobit,"But I gotta get good grades, need to one up myself from last year's project."
08-04-2018T02:04:37,unsteddyphoenix,Your academic excellence makes me feel threatened and inferior. I will now give you a wedgie.
08-04-2018T02:04:54,Dadrobit,"Which shouldn't be too hard, looking back at what I did now, I see a bunch of holes."
08-04-2018T02:05:01,Dadrobit,did then*
08-04-2018T02:05:16,Dadrobit,"A wedgie? Wow, blast from the past."
08-04-2018T02:05:29,Dadrobit,Only ever got one in my life thank goodness.
08-04-2018T02:05:40,Dadrobit,From my brother and his friend.
08-04-2018T02:05:55,Dadrobit,"Atomic wedgie, sucked ass."
08-04-2018T02:05:58,unsteddyphoenix,I was like semi-convinced they never actually happened
08-04-2018T02:06:20,unsteddyphoenix,Something you only see in cartoons
08-04-2018T02:06:31,Dadrobit,:/
08-04-2018T02:06:33,Dadrobit,I wish
08-04-2018T02:06:45,Dadrobit,6 year old me is scarred for life
08-04-2018T02:07:04,unsteddyphoenix,Good thing that guys not around anymore
08-04-2018T02:07:48,Dadrobit,I feel like that's a healthy part of the reason why I try to stay in good shape.
08-04-2018T02:07:54,Dadrobit,Never again.
08-04-2018T02:08:16,unsteddyphoenix,I wish I had been bullied to then be motivated to get in shape
08-04-2018T02:08:18,unsteddyphoenix,Youre so lucky~
08-04-2018T02:08:41,Dadrobit,Woooo~
08-04-2018T02:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,There was a weird thing wedgies kind of attributed to in my school
08-04-2018T02:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Some guys didn’t wear underwear. And you could tell, especially when some bent over"
08-04-2018T02:19:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Talk about scarred for life
08-04-2018T02:19:58,unsteddyphoenix,They...didnt wear underwear 'cause they were afraid of getting wedgies?
08-04-2018T02:20:42,unsteddyphoenix,I cant believe that's a thing that happened.
08-04-2018T02:25:56,SpazztasticKiwi,That was theorized to be a part of it. I honestly didn’t want to investigate the ful reason(s)
08-04-2018T02:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,The mystery of the missing underwear will go unsolved~
08-04-2018T02:28:31,unsteddyphoenix,How...uncomfortable sounding. Why would anyone voluntarily do that
08-04-2018T02:33:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Again, no clue - don’t want to know"
08-04-2018T02:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially since from what I understand things can get caught in jeans’ zippers
08-04-2018T02:34:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not to mention chafing, though that can happen to anyone really"
08-04-2018T02:35:37,unsteddyphoenix,I'm so very careful with zippers. The thought of that happening...urgh
08-04-2018T02:36:39,Twokinds,That's why it's better to just not bother with pants
08-04-2018T02:37:23,unsteddyphoenix,You are so right
08-04-2018T02:37:40,unsteddyphoenix,Too dangerous
08-04-2018T02:39:41,SpazztasticKiwi,No pants are the best pants
08-04-2018T02:40:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately there’s a requirement of them for public outings
08-04-2018T02:40:27,unsteddyphoenix,Support pants control
08-04-2018T02:45:39,Vatruvius,Hmm...:thinking:
08-04-2018T02:47:25,Vatruvius,Well I ended up coming back...can't stay away or find something better to do I guess.
08-04-2018T02:51:32,Twokinds,I'm going to bed
08-04-2018T02:51:36,Twokinds,G'night
08-04-2018T02:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite
08-04-2018T02:52:52,Vatruvius,Good night Tom!
08-04-2018T02:53:24,unsteddyphoenix,Ghight
08-04-2018T02:55:26,Bgrmystr2,gnight tom
08-04-2018T14:49:53,Twokinds,Good night Tom
08-04-2018T15:10:27,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
08-04-2018T15:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,🤔
08-04-2018T15:16:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re telling yourself goodnight now for last night, maybe you need to go back to sleep"
08-04-2018T15:23:07,Vatruvius,:ptv-wondering:
08-04-2018T15:23:28,Thorvald,"could not over read the whole pants discussion. we have a similiar phrase over here: Keine Hose, kein Problem!"
08-04-2018T15:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Nap sounds good right now though
08-04-2018T15:28:29,Vatruvius,Ugh...I have to send in my laptop to repair my broken keys on my keyboard.
08-04-2018T15:29:05,Vatruvius,I think I will purchase the Raspberry Pi and have it shipped here before I do...then I least I will still have a computer to use.
08-04-2018T15:49:37,Bgrmystr2,you can probably just go to repair shops and have them replace the keyboard
08-04-2018T15:49:51,Bgrmystr2,"not that it matters, most of the time, you can replace keys yourself"
08-04-2018T15:50:15,Bgrmystr2,"the main part of the keyboard is likely not damaged, just the keys either came off, or had the connections broken"
08-04-2018T15:53:31,Vatruvius,I am talking about my laptop...and the computer is no longer registering the keystroke. I called up my manufacturer as it is under warranty and they said I had to send my laptop in to get it fixed.
08-04-2018T15:55:55,Bgrmystr2,"ah, then yeah that's a membrane replacement probably"
08-04-2018T15:56:07,Bgrmystr2,"it's rather simple, but not something most people can do"
08-04-2018T16:21:54,Vatruvius,It would void my warranty if I tried to do anything anyway...I like not having to spend a dime to get something repaired.
08-04-2018T22:04:51,Vatruvius,It is very quiet here...
08-04-2018T22:05:11,NightMeaty22,maby
08-04-2018T22:05:16,NightMeaty22,...
08-04-2018T22:05:24,NightMeaty22,hello btw
08-04-2018T22:05:35,BluePhantom90,well we are lurking to see if Tom would stream
08-04-2018T22:05:53,NightMeaty22,lurks
08-04-2018T22:18:14,Vatruvius,Why would he stream today if he just streamed yesterday?
08-04-2018T22:35:28,NightMeaty22,how is eveyone doing
08-04-2018T22:38:14,Vatruvius,Alright...I guess. Starting school tomorrow so...not the best of nights.
08-04-2018T22:39:24,NightMeaty22,i hate school just went today
08-04-2018T22:39:39,NightMeaty22,and it sucked
08-04-2018T22:40:16,NightMeaty22,but it was better than being with my dad...
08-04-2018T22:48:32,Vatruvius,Sorry to hear that.
08-04-2018T22:51:47,NightMeaty22,i'm fine just depresses that school is a better place than home
08-04-2018T22:52:00,NightMeaty22,sometimes
08-04-2018T22:53:29,Vatruvius,School can be fun...I just do not like having to get up at 7:30 and drive for 50 minutes to do it.
08-04-2018T22:55:25,NightMeaty22,gettong up at 7:30 is ok. but driving at 7:30 that just sucks
08-04-2018T22:55:37,NightMeaty22,getting*
08-04-2018T23:05:15,Dadrobit,So I'm almost done doing a thing for my sound design III class. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikemTNVwioA&feature=youtu.be
08-04-2018T23:05:39,Dadrobit,"Got some critical review today,still plenty more to work on before the end of the course."
08-04-2018T23:05:51,NightMeaty22,👍
08-04-2018T23:05:52,Dadrobit,But it's coming olong fairly swimmingly.
08-04-2018T23:05:56,Dadrobit,along*
08-04-2018T23:09:43,Vatruvius,So did you enhance/replace some of the original sounds in that trailer?
08-04-2018T23:11:05,Dadrobit,100% Audio replacement.
08-04-2018T23:11:34,Dadrobit,Started with the video completely mute and created my own version.
08-04-2018T23:12:00,Vatruvius,Wow...props man...I thought you enhanced the original it was so good. :ptv-excited:
08-04-2018T23:13:48,Dadrobit,"Hahahaha, naw, thanks, but it'sgot some serious holes/flaws I need to plug and fix in the next few weeks."
08-04-2018T23:13:59,Dadrobit,it's got*
08-04-2018T23:14:42,Dadrobit,Having a lot of fun though.
08-04-2018T23:14:44,Vatruvius,Well I did not notice...perhaps if I were to watch it again and again looking for them but not when just watching the trailer. Where did you get all those sounds from?
08-04-2018T23:16:28,Dadrobit,"I created most of them in the class studio. Most of the yelling is either myself, one of my professors, or the guy sitting next to me in class. The music was Audiomachine - Fallen Army. Though there were a few things I couldn't convincingly create like"
08-04-2018T23:16:56,Dadrobit,"the arrows, that and a few combat strikes I took from the class's audio library."
08-04-2018T23:19:00,Vatruvius,I am thoroughly impressed...I can make a 2D ball bounce in a small window! If you want I can make multiple:ptv-hearts: balls!
08-04-2018T23:19:31,Vatruvius,That emoji is suppose to be on the outside of the sentence.
08-04-2018T23:24:47,Dadrobit,"Thanks kindly for the approval. I can make exactly zero balls bounce in a window, so you have me there. :)"
08-04-2018T23:25:46,Vatruvius,I also made a random walker...it is pretty cool. Though I have no idea how I could record/send you what I did. Hmm...
08-04-2018T23:27:13,Dadrobit,":/ Got no idea, Pro Tools just lets you render stuff."
08-04-2018T23:30:37,Vatruvius,"You can certainly download the tool I am using and I can send you my file. The program is called Processing...it is a free software. All you would have to do is open my document and click the ""play"" button."
08-04-2018T23:34:27,Dadrobit,Processing 3?
08-04-2018T23:37:18,Vatruvius,yes
08-04-2018T23:43:19,Dadrobit,Go ahead and dropbox your file.
08-04-2018T23:45:07,Vatruvius,Hmm...never heard of it that way. The only way I think of giving you my file would be via Discord. Do you have Discord?
08-04-2018T23:48:32,Dadrobit,"Yeah, if you want to do it that way."
08-04-2018T23:49:57,Vatruvius,Do you know a simpler way? I am happy to learn new ways of doing things.
08-04-2018T23:52:12,Dadrobit,dropbox is a free* file transfer/storage site that I use to send files to whoever needs whatever.
08-04-2018T23:53:01,Vatruvius,Ohh...one of those sites.
08-04-2018T23:53:42,Vatruvius,I feel like Discord would be easier as I have never used that site or sites similar to it. You do have Discord right...otherwise this becomes a mute point.
08-04-2018T23:54:17,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I do. Problem with Discord is file size. They don't like large files."
08-04-2018T23:54:35,Dadrobit,And I'm not dealing with clients over Discord lol.
08-04-2018T23:55:08,Vatruvius,Well I am not a client... :D
08-04-2018T23:55:10,Dadrobit,A faster way to lose professsional impressions I would be hard to come by.
08-04-2018T23:55:55,Dadrobit,I'm assuming you're in one of the TK chats?
08-04-2018T23:56:44,Vatruvius,Yes.
