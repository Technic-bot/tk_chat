15-12-2018T12:05:56,Twokinds,I just had a minor heart attack
15-12-2018T12:06:08,Twokinds,"""Oh no, did I forget to collect suggestions this week?!"""
15-12-2018T12:06:19,Ordithus,But you did
15-12-2018T12:06:23,Twokinds,I couldn't remember posting it.
15-12-2018T12:06:29,Twokinds,But apparently I did.
15-12-2018T12:06:36,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you posted it kind of early."
15-12-2018T12:06:43,Ordithus,I'd hope one of us would have reminded you
15-12-2018T12:06:47,Ordithus,We pester you like that
15-12-2018T12:07:25,Twokinds,"It's good, because I am pretty absentminded"
15-12-2018T12:07:32,Twokinds,"Well, it's more, I have a lot to keep track of."
15-12-2018T12:08:11,iliar,If this happens then you can use suggestions from the previous week.
15-12-2018T12:08:30,Azumachan,I use todoist and wunderlist for event tracking
15-12-2018T12:08:32,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
15-12-2018T12:09:44,RimaDraws,my cat is being annoying
15-12-2018T12:09:48,Dadrobit,I use my nonstop anxiety that comes from not being able to fully relax when I'm not working.
15-12-2018T12:10:07,Ordithus,I just never get everything done
15-12-2018T12:10:52,Dadrobit,"Unless I physically cannot do my job, in which case I bust out years old puzzles from the closet..."
15-12-2018T12:12:38,Twokinds,That's why I've been deverting all my scheduling to Alexa
15-12-2018T12:12:48,Twokinds,Having a robot tell me what to do all the time is nice.
15-12-2018T12:16:51,Azumachan,Is it working well ?
15-12-2018T12:16:56,Twokinds,Yes
15-12-2018T12:17:01,Twokinds,It's corrected my sleep schedule
15-12-2018T12:17:39,Azumachan,That's cool.
15-12-2018T12:18:11,RimaDraws,how much is that thing tom?

15-12-2018T12:18:49,Azumachan,30$
15-12-2018T12:20:07,Twokinds,Yeah 25 - 30 dollars
15-12-2018T12:22:01,iliar,What? Alexa costs $30?
15-12-2018T12:22:06,RimaDraws,oh sweet. i may get one. if it helps you that much maybe i should get one
15-12-2018T12:22:10,Azumachan,The dot
15-12-2018T12:22:41,Twokinds,Yeah for the small little hockey puck thing
15-12-2018T12:22:53,Twokinds,The old one is 25 and the new ones are 30
15-12-2018T12:23:00,RimaDraws,ill get the new one
15-12-2018T12:24:01,Twokinds,"Actually, the old dots are on sale for 20 right now. Must be getting rid of their inventory."
15-12-2018T12:26:09,iliar,It is pretty cheap. I thought Alexa costs $200+
15-12-2018T12:27:03,Twokinds,"They do have more expensive ones with better speakers or with screens, but it's not really necessary."
15-12-2018T12:27:12,Twokinds,They can intigrate with any smartphone.
15-12-2018T12:27:34,Twokinds,I'm sure Amazon sells them at near cost just to get people into the ecosystem.
15-12-2018T12:27:44,Twokinds,That's how they get ya.
15-12-2018T12:32:00,Azumachan,I'm knee deed in Google's one

15-12-2018T15:34:20,Twokinds,Yeah
15-12-2018T15:34:24,RimaDraws,oooh
15-12-2018T15:34:28,CrimsonQuill,Never really heard of it...
15-12-2018T15:34:32,Aphala,^ u wot
15-12-2018T15:34:37,CrimsonQuill,I'm more a Halo person.
15-12-2018T15:34:37,Dadrobit,Wut
15-12-2018T15:34:39,Aphala,It's like Adult YuGiOh
15-12-2018T15:34:41,Aphala,But good
15-12-2018T15:34:45,Azumachan,A very expensive card game.
15-12-2018T15:34:47,CrimsonQuill,Ok...
15-12-2018T15:34:58,QuinnMalachite,veeeeeeery expensive
15-12-2018T15:35:00,Twokinds,I still can't understand those weird cards with the arrows and different conditions on them
15-12-2018T15:35:03,Aphala,It's Pokemon trading cards +YuGiOh combined
15-12-2018T15:35:09,Aphala,They do have the PC game as well but...
15-12-2018T15:35:11,Aphala,mm
15-12-2018T15:35:16,Azumachan,Wallets battle.
15-12-2018T15:35:20,CrimsonQuill,"So, like Warhammer 40'000 modelling in cards."
15-12-2018T15:35:24,Aphala,Yes
15-12-2018T15:35:26,CrimsonQuill,I get it
15-12-2018T15:35:29,Twokinds,"I mean, it was the original trading card game"
15-12-2018T15:35:39,Azumachan,Yes
15-12-2018T15:35:41,CrimsonQuill,"At present, I think I'll focus on Asgore."
15-12-2018T15:35:48,Twokinds,It's what yu-gi-oh and pokemon are inspired by.
15-12-2018T15:35:58,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
15-12-2018T15:36:00,Aphala,Dammit man I have to redownload the game!
15-12-2018T15:36:05,Azumachan,Probably 13 years since i played a game.
15-12-2018T15:36:16,CrimsonQuill,I'm in Undertale
15-12-2018T15:36:23,Bgrmystr2,never got into it myself
15-12-2018T15:36:24,CrimsonQuill,Stuck on the last boss...
15-12-2018T15:36:30,QuinnMalachite,"Well 40k can't really be described as pay to win, but most trading card games are pure pay to win loot boxes"
15-12-2018T15:36:30,Aphala,Magic 2015 (on steam) is basically the digital version)
15-12-2018T15:36:47,CrimsonQuill,My sister only died 11 times. I must've died about 40 now.
15-12-2018T15:36:54,Aphala,Quinn you played Eternal Crusade?
15-12-2018T15:36:55,Aphala,lol
15-12-2018T15:37:00,QuinnMalachite,noooooooo
15-12-2018T15:37:02,Aphala,It's lootboxes
15-12-2018T15:37:04,Bgrmystr2,"this is the same stats you said last time, Quill"
15-12-2018T15:37:11,QuinnMalachite,I I stayed the hell out of that
15-12-2018T15:37:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Morning
15-12-2018T15:37:15,Aphala,It's not that bad
15-12-2018T15:37:16,Bgrmystr2,hey marv
15-12-2018T15:37:21,Aphala,Once you cough up money
15-12-2018T15:37:26,Aphala,:expressionless:
15-12-2018T15:37:31,CrimsonQuill,"I don't know what stats I have Bgrm, I lost count around the 40th death."
15-12-2018T15:37:40,CrimsonQuill,Be right back
15-12-2018T15:37:45,QuinnMalachite,"Yeah, It looked like it over promised and planned based on what they could actually do"
15-12-2018T15:38:22,QuinnMalachite,BFG armada 2 looks really good though
15-12-2018T15:38:25,Aphala,Space Marine
15-12-2018T15:38:31,Aphala,Is the penultimate 40K game
15-12-2018T15:38:34,QuinnMalachite,"Yeeeeeeees, that was so good"
15-12-2018T15:38:36,Aphala,EVERYTHING was perfect
15-12-2018T15:38:48,QuinnMalachite,"except the ending, which was a quick time event"
15-12-2018T15:38:52,Bgrmystr2,lol nothing is ever perfect.
15-12-2018T15:38:53,Aphala,Yeah
15-12-2018T15:38:55,QuinnMalachite,but I forgive it for otherwise being fantastic
15-12-2018T15:38:59,Dadrobit,The new Arena game is looking to play way better than the 2015 Steam version so far.
15-12-2018T15:39:02,Aphala,Summon a sorcerer for a bad guy
15-12-2018T15:39:09,Aphala,Classic plot dump
15-12-2018T15:39:14,Aphala,Titus was bad ass though
15-12-2018T15:39:39,Aphala,Dadrobit not heard much about that
15-12-2018T15:39:41,Aphala,Sadly
15-12-2018T15:39:47,QuinnMalachite,"I mean, how many times did Relic pull the ""It was actually me, CHAOS!"" trope"
15-12-2018T15:40:12,Aphala,*laughs in Magnus*
15-12-2018T15:40:14,Dadrobit,"Just got my ass handed to me though. Only drew 4 lands, got absolutey curbstomped ."
15-12-2018T15:40:34,Dadrobit,"It's almost to realistic like that.,"
15-12-2018T15:40:37,Dadrobit,too*
15-12-2018T15:40:37,Aphala,There will always be those hardcore players who dominate in card styles games
15-12-2018T15:40:55,Aphala,Like Hearthstone I have a few easy ones but then BAM like 8 turns it's GG
15-12-2018T15:41:24,Dadrobit,Not much you can do when my initial draw is all I get to play with while the opponent just gets perfect synergy off.
15-12-2018T15:41:26,Twokinds,Is arena new?
15-12-2018T15:41:32,Dadrobit,"Yeah, still in Beta"
15-12-2018T15:41:41,Twokinds,Is it online only?
15-12-2018T15:41:56,Dadrobit,Yeah.

15-12-2018T15:43:45,Aphala,One can only hope
15-12-2018T15:43:45,FoxxTrotter,I'll stick with Empires for now. :0P Having fun with that.

15-12-2018T15:46:51,Aphala,Best thing ever
15-12-2018T15:47:23,Shotgunr12,hello
15-12-2018T15:47:26,Aphala,Yo
15-12-2018T15:47:51,Twokinds,"As much as I'd like to, I can't play MTG Arena"
15-12-2018T15:47:54,Twokinds,I like money too much.
15-12-2018T15:48:09,Aphala,I can relate
15-12-2018T15:48:24,Dadrobit,"I mean, FTP is an option still."
15-12-2018T15:48:30,Dadrobit,S'how I do it.
15-12-2018T15:48:34,Twokinds,Don't you have to buy cards?
15-12-2018T15:48:53,CrimsonQuill,I'm back again.
15-12-2018T15:49:02,Aphala,that's the problem with those games it's all fine but the FTP grind to get the a P2P player can be exhausting and not a lot of people have enough time to grind :/
15-12-2018T15:49:04,Twokinds,"Cause I have never bought in game items for any game, and I would not want to start."
15-12-2018T15:49:06,Dadrobit,No. You unlock packs as you play.\
15-12-2018T15:49:17,Twokinds,Well that sounds more reasonable.
15-12-2018T15:49:21,Aphala,Hmm
15-12-2018T15:49:25,RandomTonio,Hello there
15-12-2018T15:49:25,Twokinds,Maybe I will give it a shot then.
15-12-2018T15:49:28,Dadrobit,Though there is the option to buy packs as well.
15-12-2018T15:49:29,RandomTonio,I see changes
15-12-2018T15:49:29,Aphala,Like as challenges ?
15-12-2018T15:50:04,Dadrobit,"Yeah. ""Play 30 Blue spells"" Win 3 Games"" ""Do 10 Damage"""
15-12-2018T15:50:07,RandomTonio,There is one more sketch left...
15-12-2018T15:50:34,Aphala,Not bad
15-12-2018T15:50:37,Aphala,Downloading now
15-12-2018T15:50:42,Dadrobit,"Challenges either give you packs outright, or they give you in game currency to buy packs."
15-12-2018T15:51:21,Dadrobit,Plus you of course start out with 5 pre made decks.
15-12-2018T15:51:30,Sammit,Hi everybody

15-12-2018T15:51:40,Dadrobit,MTG Arena
15-12-2018T15:51:47,Aphala,Seems better than the 2015 one
15-12-2018T15:51:49,Aphala,By far
15-12-2018T15:52:02,SomeDudeNamedQ,hi everyone
15-12-2018T15:52:10,Sammit,Hi Q
15-12-2018T15:52:22,Twokinds,Finally read up on how plainswalkers work
15-12-2018T15:52:25,Dadrobit,"2015 Was always a bit clunky and dated, even in 2015."
15-12-2018T15:52:30,SomeDudeNamedQ,is today the sketch stream or color stream?
15-12-2018T15:52:37,RandomTonio,Sketch
15-12-2018T15:52:53,Bgrmystr2,"mid-month, so sketch"
15-12-2018T15:53:00,Bgrmystr2,colors aren't till the last week of the month
15-12-2018T15:53:03,Aphala,"2015, even 2015 was broken to 2015"
15-12-2018T15:53:10,SomeDudeNamedQ,oh right
15-12-2018T15:53:36,Dadrobit,It was a knee jerk reaction game from Wizards to try and compete with Hearthstone and it showed.
15-12-2018T15:53:44,Aphala,I concur
15-12-2018T15:53:55,Aphala,I hate when companies rush games like that
15-12-2018T15:54:02,Aphala,DOW 3...i'm looking at you
15-12-2018T15:54:10,Aphala,You unpolished jobbie
15-12-2018T15:55:44,Dadrobit,"Hearthstone still has Arena beat by far in visuals, but I still think MTGA is a step up."
15-12-2018T15:56:55,Aphala,I'm waiting for my Stellairs game to end and I might hop on MTGA
15-12-2018T15:57:05,QuinnMalachite,"Oh god, DOW3"
15-12-2018T15:57:17,QuinnMalachite,I was given it for free and I want a refund
15-12-2018T15:57:22,Aphala,It's a shambles
15-12-2018T15:57:25,TerraTheWizard,lol
15-12-2018T15:57:30,Aphala,DOW1 and to an extent 2 were good
15-12-2018T15:57:35,Aphala,But the limited units cap
15-12-2018T15:57:37,Aphala,Really hate that
15-12-2018T15:57:55,QuinnMalachite,"DOW 1 & 2 were very different games, but I really enjoyed both"
15-12-2018T15:57:59,QuinnMalachite,I still play the last stand
15-12-2018T15:58:02,QuinnMalachite,from time to time
15-12-2018T15:58:09,MrMongMong,But nothing can ever surpass Mass Effect Andromeda in brokenness
15-12-2018T15:58:11,Aphala,Total Annihilation will be the penultimate RTS
15-12-2018T15:58:22,Aphala,It's got everything right
15-12-2018T15:58:27,SomeDudeNamedQ,I spent my fair share of money on TCGs when I was in middle/high school
15-12-2018T15:58:36,SomeDudeNamedQ,that was enough for me

15-12-2018T15:59:31,Bgrmystr2,even the original creators couldn't make a true successor.
15-12-2018T15:59:36,Aphala,Exactly
15-12-2018T15:59:44,Bgrmystr2,"and they tried 3 times,"
15-12-2018T15:59:46,Aphala,I mean Sup Com 1 was alright but dang

15-12-2018T16:02:36,ProsePro7,Subnautica was fun but it was also irritating at times

15-12-2018T20:48:04,Aphala,I mean Magpie is just Magpie
15-12-2018T20:48:07,MarshallMelon,"Maddie still has/had a crush on Keith, remember"
15-12-2018T20:48:08,Aphala,She's a solo agent
15-12-2018T20:48:09,Ordithus,"In sketchland, which is 110% canon, yes"
15-12-2018T20:48:11,Aphala,I suspect
15-12-2018T20:48:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanna see if Kat or Trace baking cookies or my other sketch would do good
15-12-2018T20:49:11,Aphala,Kat should be solo
15-12-2018T20:49:22,Aphala,Eric is a poon hound
15-12-2018T20:49:33,HeresyArtStream,later
15-12-2018T20:49:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Since baking cookies isn’t as strictly Christmas related, I’m probably gonna keep to my original and just save the others"
15-12-2018T20:49:36,RimaDraws,well i hope i can make the stream next week
15-12-2018T20:49:38,Ordithus,Bye Heresy

15-12-2018T20:50:08,Aphala,Eric is a horn dog but he thinks of her as a sister
15-12-2018T20:50:33,Aphala,Other than Zen who can she go with
15-12-2018T20:50:37,Aphala,:P
15-12-2018T20:50:56,MarshallMelon,Honestly I've found it much more enjoyable to stop submitting suggestions
15-12-2018T20:51:09,MarshallMelon,These streams are best experienced as a spectator
15-12-2018T20:51:11,Aphala,I can agreed
15-12-2018T20:51:30,Ordithus,I like suggesting things. My happiness isn't dependent on it being drawn
15-12-2018T20:51:34,Aphala,If everyone let Tom do this thing
15-12-2018T20:51:34,Ordithus,"I just have fun, anyways"

15-12-2018T20:52:17,Aphala,TwoKinds has a ship problem
15-12-2018T20:52:21,Ordithus,"Though, I must admit, it is a treat to have a suggestion drawn"
15-12-2018T20:52:27,RimaDraws,yea it is
15-12-2018T20:52:29,Aphala,It has so man would be couples
15-12-2018T20:52:35,MarshallMelon,Also because after 2 years I'm out of novel ideas

15-12-2018T20:54:04,Aphala,Even if he can re-read it we are providing feedback
15-12-2018T20:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh it flickered to offline for a second there
15-12-2018T20:54:36,Ordithus,"Kiwi, it's over!"

15-12-2018T21:15:46,Bgrmystr2,there's so many genres out there

15-12-2018T21:15:53,RimaDraws,i didn't have an edgy phase till after high school i think?
15-12-2018T21:15:53,Ordithus,"Like, waaay back, I listened to almost exclusively classical and jazz"

15-12-2018T21:26:28,Bgrmystr2,"People take advantage of saying ""I'm sick"" and they're not sick, they just want to get paid without going in to work"
15-12-2018T21:26:33,Bgrmystr2,it's a bad practice
15-12-2018T21:26:38,Aphala,True but we don't usually do that
15-12-2018T21:26:39,Aphala,:D

15-12-2018T21:28:59,MarshallMelon,To be fair stuff like holidays is subjective in the US depending on job/state
15-12-2018T21:29:04,Aphala,Trust me UK / EU have it sorted
15-12-2018T21:29:16,Aphala,No fuck about Tax is REALLY serious in the UK
15-12-2018T21:29:17,MarshallMelon,The only thing I would genuinely fault them for is healthcare

15-12-2018T21:29:54,Aphala,But dam you need to unfuck that shit ASAP :O
15-12-2018T21:29:55,MarshallMelon,"If you have to lose your house and savings to get life-saving care, something's wrong"

15-12-2018T21:30:36,MarshallMelon,"As a fellow Brit, your nationalism is misplaced"
15-12-2018T21:30:49,MarshallMelon,We're about to get a whole lot more US-like
15-12-2018T21:30:50,Aphala,True
15-12-2018T21:30:50,Ordithus,"If you have a fulltime, professional job, it isn't too horrible"

15-12-2018T21:31:08,Ordithus,Health insurance helps... but it's still way complex
15-12-2018T21:31:13,Aphala,But dam I'd not live anywhere else unless the NHS was privatised
15-12-2018T21:31:14,Destro35,Bye

15-12-2018T21:31:55,MarshallMelon,The thing that amazes me is how the GOP fights universal healthcare with such vigor
15-12-2018T21:31:56,Aphala,Weird ass Yellow buggery
15-12-2018T21:32:05,MarshallMelon,"Like, it's been proven to work almost everywhere. What's the risk?"
15-12-2018T21:32:18,MarshallMelon,Aside from losing M O N E Y
15-12-2018T21:32:37,Aphala,I guess the US has a MASSIVE reliance on healthcare
15-12-2018T21:32:38,Ordithus,The almight dollar
15-12-2018T21:32:47,Aphala,Obamacare was half like the UK

15-12-2018T21:34:55,Aphala,True
15-12-2018T21:34:55,MarshallMelon,"No, seriously"
15-12-2018T21:35:06,MarshallMelon,It's got a lot of people worried
15-12-2018T21:35:19,Aphala,He needs to forget about CHINA and focus on the US
15-12-2018T21:35:20,MarshallMelon,Seeing as he has control over the nukes and whatnot
15-12-2018T21:35:55,Aphala,He's weirdly childish
15-12-2018T21:36:09,Aphala,I suppose no one is perfect

15-12-2018T21:37:17,Bgrmystr2,so.. we're stuck with garbage
15-12-2018T21:37:24,MarshallMelon,To be fair your current system is so ingrained that just suddenly making an AHS or whatever wouldn't work
15-12-2018T21:37:31,Aphala,If you had federal healthcare plan that made sense to the world it'd be fine :P
15-12-2018T21:37:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's also true
15-12-2018T21:37:38,MarshallMelon,"Obama was right, it has to be a slow adoption process"
15-12-2018T21:37:40,MarshallMelon,Bit by bit
15-12-2018T21:37:46,Aphala,You always have Federal / State lawas
15-12-2018T21:37:49,Aphala,VERY confusing
15-12-2018T21:37:55,Aphala,Stop it :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
15-12-2018T21:37:58,Bgrmystr2,the problem is that you'll never get anywhere with slow process lol
15-12-2018T21:38:12,Aphala,Uniform law makes more sense tbhat
15-12-2018T21:38:14,MarshallMelon,Good ol' two-party system in action
15-12-2018T21:38:18,Aphala,^
15-12-2018T21:38:29,Bgrmystr2,cuz it takes years to make each change and then it barely changes much and it takes even longer for it to actually make a noticable change in the real world
15-12-2018T21:38:39,Bgrmystr2,you never get anywhere
15-12-2018T21:38:42,Aphala,We have mtuples in the UK sure it's arse most of the time but we have choice
15-12-2018T21:38:54,Aphala,Coms  / Libs
15-12-2018T21:38:55,MarshallMelon,Not that the ACA ever got a chance to shine. Pity really
15-12-2018T21:39:22,Aphala,Liberals hate the right < Cons hate those commie tier rights
15-12-2018T21:39:27,Aphala,It's all backwards
15-12-2018T21:39:35,Aphala,Not all libs want immigrants
15-12-2018T21:39:57,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know why having healthcare is so difficult... it's an amount everyone pays, and it covers literally everyone in the country."
15-12-2018T21:39:58,Aphala,Not all cons want Hetro only systems
15-12-2018T21:40:10,Aphala,Plus US is MASSIVE
15-12-2018T21:40:14,MarshallMelon,"Because politics, Bgr"
15-12-2018T21:40:24,Aphala,US is huge can't fault that
15-12-2018T21:40:24,MarshallMelon,"If the Dems want something, the Reps have to crush it"
15-12-2018T21:40:32,Bgrmystr2,"none of this insurance shit, you just pay the healcare tax thing, it goes to healthcare, and EVERYONE is covered. But no"
15-12-2018T21:40:34,Aphala,But there is a better system parity
15-12-2018T21:40:34,MarshallMelon,"It's really childish, but it's what happens"
15-12-2018T21:40:48,MarshallMelon,Partisan politics
15-12-2018T21:40:55,Aphala,True we can't comment UK has a totally wank system
15-12-2018T21:40:57,Bgrmystr2,we're charging people even morer money simply cuz they can't afford healthcare in the first place..
15-12-2018T21:41:15,Bgrmystr2,who the fuck even.. came up with that
15-12-2018T21:41:15,MarshallMelon,"Big Pharma, Big Hospital etc."
15-12-2018T21:41:21,MarshallMelon,Lobbyists won't allow it
15-12-2018T21:41:29,Bgrmystr2,they're the problem really
15-12-2018T21:41:39,Aphala,Lobbyist systems is so fucking broke
15-12-2018T21:41:45,Aphala,Cut that
15-12-2018T21:41:47,Aphala,Firstr
15-12-2018T21:41:54,Aphala,Really remove it
15-12-2018T21:41:58,Aphala,It's so bad
15-12-2018T21:42:02,Aphala,Ruining the US
15-12-2018T21:42:05,MarshallMelon,Thing is to cut the lobbying system you'd have to get the senators to vote for it
15-12-2018T21:42:09,Ordithus,"It's strange how popular an idea universal healthcare is, but it's not popular in congress"
15-12-2018T21:42:11,MarshallMelon,Guess who benefits from lobbying?
15-12-2018T21:42:30,Aphala,I mean as a Scot from the UK i'd rather have the US healthy
15-12-2018T21:42:35,Bgrmystr2,It's not illegal for corps to give lots of money so they get something that only benefits them. That's one of the biggest issues methinks. and it's really unfortunate
15-12-2018T21:42:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz everyone loses
15-12-2018T21:42:43,Aphala,First world represent!
15-12-2018T21:42:59,MarshallMelon,That good ol' Citizens United case
15-12-2018T21:43:06,MarshallMelon,What a GOOD THING that turned out to be
15-12-2018T21:43:27,MarshallMelon,Not
15-12-2018T21:43:30,Aphala,Only problem is the US is under some weird liberal paranoid system
15-12-2018T21:43:33,Bgrmystr2,there's so much fucked.. :ptv-uneasy:
15-12-2018T21:43:40,Aphala,The left isn't attacking you
15-12-2018T21:43:46,Aphala,The media hupe is
15-12-2018T21:43:49,Aphala,hype*
15-12-2018T21:43:56,MarshallMelon,"That's more of a historical thing, Aph"
15-12-2018T21:44:02,Aphala,True
15-12-2018T21:44:09,Bgrmystr2,"everyone's attacking everyone, it's been that way for a very long time"
15-12-2018T21:44:10,MarshallMelon,Red Scare in the Twenties. Cold War in the post-war period
15-12-2018T21:44:12,Bgrmystr2,fighting for control
15-12-2018T21:44:20,Bgrmystr2,and using fear to gain power
15-12-2018T21:44:45,Aphala,I genuinely wish that the US gets big again
15-12-2018T21:44:53,MarshallMelon,...it is?
15-12-2018T21:45:00,unsteddyphoenix,Or great again?
15-12-2018T21:45:04,Aphala,Like 1940s big
15-12-2018T21:45:12,Aphala,Nothing like is is now
15-12-2018T21:45:13,MarshallMelon,"As in ""half the world owes us money"" big"
15-12-2018T21:45:18,MarshallMelon,"Yeah, not a good idea"
15-12-2018T21:45:25,Ordithus,"You mean, when we were the only country not burnt to the ground by a horrible war?"
15-12-2018T21:45:28,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it is, but it was never great to begin with.. There was always problems even in the early days of the country"
15-12-2018T21:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,^
15-12-2018T21:45:42,Aphala,Money is a weird bullshit conecpt
15-12-2018T21:45:43,RimaDraws,hm...
15-12-2018T21:45:45,Ordithus,"That's why the US dominated, didn't get blown to smithereens"
15-12-2018T21:45:47,Bgrmystr2,"so we can't become great ""again"" cuz we'd have to have been great in the past to start with.."
15-12-2018T21:45:51,Ordithus,^
15-12-2018T21:45:59,MarshallMelon,Roaring Twenties were okay
15-12-2018T21:46:07,MarshallMelon,Before that little kerfuffle at the end
15-12-2018T21:46:09,Ordithus,Then :fire:
15-12-2018T21:46:17,Aphala,if the EU solidifies as a commitment we'd be top dog
15-12-2018T21:46:23,Ordithus,"Though that was pre Civil rights, so still shit"
15-12-2018T21:46:24,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a video on that you know
15-12-2018T21:46:27,Aphala,but you know immigration
15-12-2018T21:46:28,Aphala,lol
15-12-2018T21:46:43,MarshallMelon,"From an economic standpoint though, the 1920s were great"
15-12-2018T21:46:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains how US was never great and all that
15-12-2018T21:46:47,Aphala,One day we'll just be EARTH nothing more
15-12-2018T21:46:49,MarshallMelon,Until that one little thing
15-12-2018T21:46:57,Aphala,Dam south africa though
15-12-2018T21:47:01,Ordithus,It was just a lil hiccup
15-12-2018T21:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Seen it, Bgr?"
15-12-2018T21:47:09,MarshallMelon,A lil' speedbump
15-12-2018T21:47:19,Bgrmystr2,uh.. probably not Kiwi
15-12-2018T21:47:36,Bgrmystr2,don't know of any videos talking about it
15-12-2018T21:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I can shoot it to you if you want
15-12-2018T21:47:42,Aphala,How about the US and UK combine as a power force
15-12-2018T21:47:45,Bgrmystr2,sure
15-12-2018T21:47:49,Aphala,We'd fucking mince everyone
15-12-2018T21:47:50,Bgrmystr2,I can watch it sometime later
15-12-2018T21:47:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta find it real quick
15-12-2018T21:47:52,RimaDraws,i think ill disappear for a bit.

15-12-2018T21:48:04,Bgrmystr2,there was a war over it XD
15-12-2018T21:48:07,MarshallMelon,"Good idea, Rima. Too politics-y in here"
15-12-2018T21:48:19,Aphala,We can make a VERY LARGE BRIDGE :ctwokinds-maevecute:
15-12-2018T21:48:21,MarshallMelon,POLITICAL! That's the word
15-12-2018T21:48:22,Ordithus,"Two, even, Bgr"

15-12-2018T21:48:45,Aphala,We're all about the union of two powers :P
15-12-2018T21:48:49,Bgrmystr2,"lol, the war for independance and..? :o"
15-12-2018T21:48:52,RimaDraws,i dont come here to talk politics

15-12-2018T21:48:58,Aphala,Scotland will be independant :O
15-12-2018T21:49:03,MarshallMelon,"Neither do I, this is kind of an outlier"
15-12-2018T21:49:04,Aphala,Some time
15-12-2018T21:49:09,Aphala,I guess
15-12-2018T21:49:18,MarshallMelon,That won't end well for you
15-12-2018T21:49:22,MarshallMelon,Not at first anyway
15-12-2018T21:49:29,Aphala,I dunno we've got most of the oil
15-12-2018T21:49:36,MarshallMelon,Your microeconomy isn't big enough
15-12-2018T21:49:47,Bgrmystr2,ahh there was a second war of independance
15-12-2018T21:49:50,Aphala,I mean we can produce A LOT of whisky
15-12-2018T21:49:51,Bgrmystr2,okay
15-12-2018T21:50:08,Bgrmystr2,my memory of class is fuzzy
15-12-2018T21:50:13,Bgrmystr2,history class*
15-12-2018T21:50:18,Aphala,World has alchys

15-12-2018T21:50:30,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it was like.. mid 1990s

15-12-2018T21:51:04,Aphala,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
15-12-2018T21:51:31,Ordithus,:ptv-scratch:
15-12-2018T21:51:40,Bgrmystr2,"cheers, thanks Kiwi"
15-12-2018T21:51:42,Bgrmystr2,will check it out
15-12-2018T21:51:52,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s cool
15-12-2018T21:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked it. Good meat to it
15-12-2018T21:52:17,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure if I'm just remembering both wars as one.. or if they only talked about one..
15-12-2018T21:52:38,Bgrmystr2,feelsbad :C
15-12-2018T21:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"As for the he I was asking about being gone earlier , it was Aphala"
15-12-2018T21:52:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah I figured
15-12-2018T21:52:56,Ordithus,Yeeeah
15-12-2018T21:53:19,RimaDraws,>>
15-12-2018T21:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I was hoping he’d go so I could jump in but after a bit I just decided to ignore
15-12-2018T21:53:40,Bgrmystr2,"he wasn't the only problem imo, but least it's over now."
15-12-2018T21:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not talking about the apparent obsession with politics
15-12-2018T21:54:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Thought that was admittedly dull
15-12-2018T21:54:19,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-12-2018T21:54:23,Ordithus,The earlier bit?
15-12-2018T21:54:26,RimaDraws,im glad he is gone
15-12-2018T21:54:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Ring a ding ding Ord
15-12-2018T21:54:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just ew
15-12-2018T21:54:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Big ew moment
15-12-2018T21:54:51,Ordithus,Yeah
15-12-2018T21:54:54,Bgrmystr2,"I would feel the same Rima, but he's just one of many."
15-12-2018T21:55:21,RimaDraws,i just dont want to be here with people i enjoy company with and talk politics. its not what i want to get into
15-12-2018T21:55:31,MarshallMelon,Seems we've had an influx them in the last few months
15-12-2018T21:55:34,MarshallMelon,No idea why
15-12-2018T21:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"In the meantime, I managed to get Bagheera to let me balance my nailclppers on his head"
15-12-2018T21:55:45,Ordithus,lol
15-12-2018T21:55:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I was more amused than him
15-12-2018T21:55:55,Ordithus,I bet
15-12-2018T21:56:02,Ordithus,Kitty not amused
15-12-2018T21:56:09,SpazztasticKiwi,“Why?”
15-12-2018T21:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,“And how is this entertaining to you?”
15-12-2018T21:56:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And a little of “There. Happy now?”
15-12-2018T21:56:57,Ordithus,"I get that, Rima.  Politics is rarely fun to discuss"
15-12-2018T21:57:18,MarshallMelon,"Huh, weird. Iliar's account is flagged as being a bot"
15-12-2018T21:57:28,RimaDraws,i just want to enjoy being here in chat. i know i can't make people not say things but i just don't like that..
15-12-2018T21:57:29,Ordithus,It is
15-12-2018T21:57:40,MarshallMelon,Okay then
15-12-2018T21:57:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's been that way
15-12-2018T21:57:50,MarshallMelon,Never noticed I guess
15-12-2018T21:58:17,Bgrmystr2,cuz he's got bot stuff going on his account to record the stream and such
15-12-2018T21:58:23,Bgrmystr2,it's all automatic
15-12-2018T21:58:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Iliar: 🤖
15-12-2018T21:58:43,MarshallMelon,"Ah yeah, that'd make sense. Although he could just use OBS on the archives"
15-12-2018T21:58:51,Ordithus,What has me concerned is Nibblybot occasionally Nibblys now
15-12-2018T21:59:04,SpazztasticKiwi,She has become aware
15-12-2018T21:59:07,Bgrmystr2,that's kinda pointless when you can just download the archive the website saves
15-12-2018T21:59:20,MarshallMelon,Back in ye olde days you couldn't
15-12-2018T21:59:22,Bgrmystr2,he records it in case the site recording fails
15-12-2018T21:59:44,Ordithus,The site recording also only goes back so far
15-12-2018T21:59:53,MarshallMelon,"12 at a time, with reserved slots"
15-12-2018T21:59:58,MarshallMelon,So more like 8
15-12-2018T22:00:01,Bgrmystr2,and yeah it's actually been possible to download them far back as I can remember
15-12-2018T22:00:24,Bgrmystr2,I think I was around when picarto implemented recordings
15-12-2018T22:00:31,Bgrmystr2,it's been a couple years?
15-12-2018T22:00:33,MarshallMelon,Early 2017
15-12-2018T22:00:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah see
15-12-2018T22:00:43,MarshallMelon,Or at least that's when Tom turned them on
15-12-2018T22:00:54,Bgrmystr2,Fluff as well
15-12-2018T22:01:03,MarshallMelon,Earliest recording dates from around early February '17
15-12-2018T22:01:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Bgr in old man voice: back in MY day
15-12-2018T22:01:06,SpazztasticKiwi,...
15-12-2018T22:01:19,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-condescending:
15-12-2018T22:01:29,MarshallMelon,I've got a couple of older ones recorded though
15-12-2018T22:01:34,MarshallMelon,"Not many, but some"
15-12-2018T22:01:46,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah they were downloadable all back then too, just gotta know your way around how the website hosts the files on the server and stuff"
15-12-2018T22:01:51,Bgrmystr2,and haha kiwi
15-12-2018T22:01:53,Bgrmystr2,yes
15-12-2018T22:01:59,Bgrmystr2,that is my feel.
15-12-2018T22:02:01,MarshallMelon,"Or in my case, idle the PC overnight with OBS running"
15-12-2018T22:02:20,MarshallMelon,"Not efficient, but it worked"
15-12-2018T22:02:38,MarshallMelon,Mostly
15-12-2018T22:03:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Feels like the more we go towards quicker, easier, and more compact, the worse we get"
15-12-2018T22:03:31,MarshallMelon,From a software perspective maybe
15-12-2018T22:03:34,MarshallMelon,Tech on the other hand
15-12-2018T22:03:58,Bgrmystr2,Software is becoming less and less user-friendly
15-12-2018T22:04:04,Bgrmystr2,and becoming more and more a nanny
15-12-2018T22:04:09,Bgrmystr2,holding your hand and doing everything for you
15-12-2018T22:04:23,MarshallMelon,Or trying to grab as much cash as possible out of you

15-12-2018T22:22:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Y’all think I jumped too quick with that Aphala thing...?
15-12-2018T22:22:26,Ordithus,No
15-12-2018T22:22:36,Bgrmystr2,how do you mean? Like jumped ship?
15-12-2018T22:22:51,Bgrmystr2,cuz I don't think so
15-12-2018T22:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I jumped cause of that and he said himself that he had a knack to be annoying for fun or something like that
15-12-2018T22:24:30,Ordithus,"Honestly, I feel like I failed you and Rima"
15-12-2018T22:24:34,Bgrmystr2,He seems to have a severe lack of understanding of how that works
15-12-2018T22:24:42,RimaDraws,i can usually handle myself
15-12-2018T22:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just maybe it was that or he was being creepy
15-12-2018T22:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to vote mainly for the latter
15-12-2018T22:25:39,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, Rima was adding fuel to the fire, giving him another target rather than letting the guy burn himself out"
15-12-2018T22:25:49,Bgrmystr2,"ye old addage, don't feed the troll"
15-12-2018T22:25:55,Bgrmystr2,it applies.

15-12-2018T22:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ord, i think you were just fine. It wasn’t an outright sexual comment, but something creepy"
15-12-2018T22:26:27,Ordithus,He... was misbehaving the whole bloody time
15-12-2018T22:26:41,RimaDraws,not to be discriminative but hes a brit

15-12-2018T22:57:03,Ordithus,"Go home Bagheera, you drunk"
15-12-2018T22:59:44,RimaDraws,bagheera.exe stopped working
15-12-2018T23:03:12,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s dozing

15-12-2018T23:07:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Well
15-12-2018T23:07:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t ever recall us ever saying names

15-12-2018T23:07:31,Ordithus,"My name is ""insert name here"""
15-12-2018T23:07:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s pretty well kept we keep them hush hush
15-12-2018T23:07:47,Bgrmystr2,I don't. :thinking:
15-12-2018T23:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Mmmk
15-12-2018T23:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But yeah. Mark’s been driving home with Amy and Henry and Chica
15-12-2018T23:08:25,Bgrmystr2,"I just never had reason to say it, most the time, I ask out of habit lol"
15-12-2018T23:08:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And he’s replaced Henry’s been getting sick
15-12-2018T23:08:47,Bgrmystr2,but in that moment I very much read it wrong
15-12-2018T23:08:49,SpazztasticKiwi,reported
15-12-2018T23:09:03,Bgrmystr2,D: Replaced

15-12-2018T23:09:47,Ordithus,"whew, good"
15-12-2018T23:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,He just seems to be a nervous puker
15-12-2018T23:09:57,Bgrmystr2,:<
15-12-2018T23:09:58,Bgrmystr2,aw

15-12-2018T23:10:30,RimaDraws,awww
15-12-2018T23:10:38,RimaDraws,looks like chica
15-12-2018T23:10:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s on Mark’s Twitter now. He’s been updating on their drive progress
15-12-2018T23:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And instagram
15-12-2018T23:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,He looks like Chica but a bit darker. And those ears!
15-12-2018T23:11:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Need a link?
15-12-2018T23:11:58,Ordithus,"If you're asking me, no, I already found him"
15-12-2018T23:12:05,Ordithus,When I made that comment
15-12-2018T23:12:35,Bgrmystr2,"uh, I'll take one"
15-12-2018T23:12:51,SpazztasticKiwi,https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/1074007622330642432?s=21
15-12-2018T23:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Henry is on the left. Chica is on the right
15-12-2018T23:13:11,SpazztasticKiwi,The cute
15-12-2018T23:13:26,Bgrmystr2,ooh okay

15-12-2018T23:14:42,Bgrmystr2,"Wish him the best, sick dogs are never fun"
15-12-2018T23:16:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Good news is there hasn’t been anymore puke news today 👍🏻
15-12-2018T23:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,So I figure he’s good now
15-12-2018T23:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I am curious as to how Mark keeps his all-white car interior clean
15-12-2018T23:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be terrified of having white seating
15-12-2018T23:20:21,Ordithus,Clean it all the time?  With dogs you have to clean the interior constantly anyways
15-12-2018T23:20:31,Ordithus,Unless you want to live in a hairy mess
15-12-2018T23:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Best friend is a vacuum
15-12-2018T23:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,He has a rather attractive car though I’ll say
15-12-2018T23:23:05,Ordithus,what is his car?
15-12-2018T23:23:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Tesla X
15-12-2018T23:23:26,Ordithus,Really? Cool
15-12-2018T23:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d likely never try one but it’s good lookin
15-12-2018T23:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if you know what an X looks like, try the Roadster"
15-12-2018T23:24:59,SpazztasticKiwi,That. Is a sexy car
15-12-2018T23:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Course I only admire. They’re not practical. Just for looks
15-12-2018T23:25:33,Ordithus,Old or new?
15-12-2018T23:25:48,SpazztasticKiwi,His X? A year old I think
15-12-2018T23:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,He did a video a bit ago and my memory’s still not good on it
15-12-2018T23:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,He mentioned swapping it out from the S model so he’d have the extra room the X gives for Chica to travel
15-12-2018T23:26:55,Ordithus,"The roadster is what I meant.  There's one coming out soon, but the old Roadster was Tesla's first cr"
15-12-2018T23:26:57,Ordithus,*car
15-12-2018T23:27:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah the new
15-12-2018T23:27:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He put up a vid about the free Roadster after 50 or something referrals
15-12-2018T23:27:51,Ordithus,"Yeah, that is a pretty car.  Ludicrous fast"
15-12-2018T23:29:29,SpazztasticKiwi,0-60 in a second or something right
15-12-2018T23:30:15,Ordithus,A bit longer than that
15-12-2018T23:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone who gets that thing isn’t gonna go just 60
15-12-2018T23:30:19,Bgrmystr2,I dunno I'm not a big fan of the design of Tesla's cars
15-12-2018T23:30:25,Bgrmystr2,"the physical design, specifically"
15-12-2018T23:30:35,Ordithus,But still way faster than is sensible
15-12-2018T23:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a car in Ifunny being made fun of cause it looked like a calculator cover
15-12-2018T23:30:53,SpazztasticKiwi,And you know what? It did
15-12-2018T23:31:16,Twokinds,:blue_car:
15-12-2018T23:31:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Heya tom
15-12-2018T23:31:31,Ordithus,I like the exterior of Teslas.  The inside... not as much
15-12-2018T23:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,But the Tesla isn’t terribly sensible to me eithter
15-12-2018T23:31:46,Twokinds,:ptv-dealwithit:
15-12-2018T23:31:47,Bgrmystr2,they're too round imo
15-12-2018T23:31:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Bubble cars
15-12-2018T23:31:58,Bgrmystr2,yes exactly
15-12-2018T23:31:59,Bgrmystr2,I hate it
15-12-2018T23:32:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh but not bubble cars
15-12-2018T23:32:03,Bgrmystr2,the sleek round.. not a fan
15-12-2018T23:32:14,Ordithus,What car is more your style?
15-12-2018T23:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you ever seen the actual bubble car?
15-12-2018T23:32:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Google something like “bubble car”
15-12-2018T23:32:35,Twokinds,All cars look the same to me.
15-12-2018T23:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It looks like what would happen if you farted in a smart car
15-12-2018T23:32:51,unsteddyphoenix,Some cars are red and some arent red.
15-12-2018T23:32:55,Bgrmystr2,"the sharp jagged stuff, cars that have a style.. I like uhh"
15-12-2018T23:32:56,unsteddyphoenix,So thats a difference
15-12-2018T23:32:57,Twokinds,My car is red
15-12-2018T23:32:58,RimaDraws,ugh i dozed off

15-12-2018T23:33:06,unsteddyphoenix,Ah so yours is the red type
15-12-2018T23:33:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom I have a feeling you just look for something with wheels
15-12-2018T23:33:27,Twokinds,Well I didn't buy it
15-12-2018T23:33:47,unsteddyphoenix,You find it?
15-12-2018T23:34:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I figured you would just get a car even if you preferred it be red
15-12-2018T23:34:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if you went shopping and found yourself a red one, cool"
15-12-2018T23:34:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause otherwise your mother or Mark got it

15-12-2018T23:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a beetle! Squash it!
15-12-2018T23:35:41,Ordithus,It's a rolling jelly bean
15-12-2018T23:35:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a wheeled cockroach
15-12-2018T23:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Kill it with fire
15-12-2018T23:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Before it reproduces
15-12-2018T23:36:11,Bgrmystr2,"no, I like stuff like the 1965 GTO https://classics.autotrader.com/classic-cars/1965/pontiac/gto/101055741"
15-12-2018T23:36:15,Bgrmystr2,or the 1970 El Camino https://classics.autotrader.com/classic-cars/1965/pontiac/gto/101055741
15-12-2018T23:36:21,Bgrmystr2,..wait
15-12-2018T23:36:23,Twokinds,"Sort of, yeah."
15-12-2018T23:36:25,Bgrmystr2,that's not the right link
15-12-2018T23:36:37,Bgrmystr2,"https://classics.autotrader.com/classic-cars/1970/chevrolet/el_camino/100942329 this one, sorry"
15-12-2018T23:36:57,Ordithus,Those look nice~
15-12-2018T23:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,“Sort of” what? I said like three options
15-12-2018T23:37:18,Bgrmystr2,"Though in sheer design, I would love having like.. the Lamborghini Diablo SV"
15-12-2018T23:37:23,Bgrmystr2,or the Roadster version of it
15-12-2018T23:37:33,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Good find.
15-12-2018T23:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I’ve said, I like the Bugatti"
15-12-2018T23:37:42,Bgrmystr2,"I'm torn, cuz the roadster is badass lookin and the normal SV has the roof scoops"
15-12-2018T23:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,The color changing one
15-12-2018T23:38:04,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really care about the engine or whatnot, it's really the design  of the car that gets my fancy"
15-12-2018T23:38:14,Bgrmystr2,I love the cars that stand out
15-12-2018T23:38:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"But as for real life cars I’d actually get and don’t just like the looks of, I’m a Chevy Cruze person"
15-12-2018T23:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Simple
15-12-2018T23:39:00,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, the Scion xB was also one of the more recent cars I liked, cuz at the time.. of all the cars trying to be all round and uniform, it said fuck you guys, I'm a box."
15-12-2018T23:39:19,Ordithus,"haha, yeah, it did.  But it was still ugly as sin"
15-12-2018T23:39:28,Bgrmystr2,I think that's part of why I liked it
15-12-2018T23:39:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz I absolutely hate the same-y look of all the cars everyone drives
15-12-2018T23:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’m a box”
15-12-2018T23:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Beautiful
15-12-2018T23:40:12,Bgrmystr2,"I'd be just as happy driving around a delorean as an every-day car, just cuz I love the look of it"
15-12-2018T23:40:24,Bgrmystr2,"I don't care if it's gas, electric, whatever, the internals don't matter"

15-12-2018T23:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,But here’s the bubble car

15-12-2018T23:41:47,Bgrmystr2,a really super big pin
15-12-2018T23:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d prefer you burn it
15-12-2018T23:42:11,Bgrmystr2,I kinda wanna burn it.. then pop it so all the pieces are small enough to burn up in the air and disappear.
15-12-2018T23:42:24,Bgrmystr2,disappears without a trace
15-12-2018T23:42:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"And as for the interior of the teslas, what got me was seeing the inside of Mark’s X"
15-12-2018T23:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,White interiors give me nightmares
15-12-2018T23:43:05,Bgrmystr2,I don't see interiors that often

15-12-2018T23:44:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway, I’d hate for Tom to join only to be lost so what else we got for a topic?"
15-12-2018T23:44:36,Ordithus,Probably one of my favorite car designs is the Jag F-type https://goo.gl/images/azyfPJ
15-12-2018T23:44:55,Twokinds,That looks like a car alright
15-12-2018T23:44:58,Bgrmystr2,it's all round and stuff :c
15-12-2018T23:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I like Jags but
15-12-2018T23:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
15-12-2018T23:45:07,SpazztasticKiwi,What Bgr said
15-12-2018T23:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I did see a Jag model once that got my eye cause it was good looking, almost Mustang looking"
15-12-2018T23:46:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But I never got a good look cause it was on the highway
15-12-2018T23:46:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Also. The Mustang GT
15-12-2018T23:47:16,SpazztasticKiwi,👌🏻
15-12-2018T23:47:22,Ordithus,Agreed
15-12-2018T23:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a relatively popular sports car round here
15-12-2018T23:47:44,Ordithus,Definitely my fav pony car
15-12-2018T23:48:03,Bgrmystr2,I still like the GT40 the most
15-12-2018T23:48:10,Bgrmystr2,moreso than the others like that
15-12-2018T23:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark apparently got to ride in one with Jordan Maron
15-12-2018T23:48:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes me slightly salty
15-12-2018T23:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And to clarify - Jordan Maron is CaptainSparklz. Another YouTuber
15-12-2018T23:50:36,Bgrmystr2,ooh
15-12-2018T23:50:53,Bgrmystr2,The only thing I know of him is his minecraft skyblock playthrough
15-12-2018T23:51:06,Bgrmystr2,and he always had some pretty good music for his timelapses
