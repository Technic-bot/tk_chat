15-12-2018T12:06:23,Twokinds,I couldn't remember posting it.
15-12-2018T12:06:29,Twokinds,But apparently I did.
15-12-2018T12:06:36,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you posted it kind of early."
15-12-2018T12:06:43,Ordithus,I'd hope one of us would have reminded you
15-12-2018T12:06:47,Ordithus,We pester you like that
15-12-2018T12:07:25,Twokinds,"It's good, because I am pretty absentminded"
15-12-2018T12:07:32,Twokinds,"Well, it's more, I have a lot to keep track of."
15-12-2018T12:08:11,iliar,If this happens then you can use suggestions from the previous week.
15-12-2018T12:08:30,Azumachan,I use todoist and wunderlist for event tracking
15-12-2018T12:08:32,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
15-12-2018T12:09:44,RimaDraws,my cat is being annoying
15-12-2018T12:09:48,Dadrobit,I use my nonstop anxiety that comes from not being able to fully relax when I'm not working.
15-12-2018T12:10:07,Ordithus,I just never get everything done
15-12-2018T12:10:52,Dadrobit,"Unless I physically cannot do my job, in which case I bust out years old puzzles from the closet..."
15-12-2018T12:12:38,Twokinds,That's why I've been deverting all my scheduling to Alexa
15-12-2018T12:12:48,Twokinds,Having a robot tell me what to do all the time is nice.
15-12-2018T12:16:51,Azumachan,Is it working well ?
15-12-2018T12:16:56,Twokinds,Yes
15-12-2018T12:17:01,Twokinds,It's corrected my sleep schedule
15-12-2018T12:17:39,Azumachan,That's cool.
15-12-2018T12:18:11,RimaDraws,how much is that thing tom?

15-12-2018T12:18:49,Azumachan,30$
15-12-2018T12:20:07,Twokinds,Yeah 25 - 30 dollars
15-12-2018T12:22:01,iliar,What? Alexa costs $30?
15-12-2018T12:22:06,RimaDraws,oh sweet. i may get one. if it helps you that much maybe i should get one
15-12-2018T12:22:10,Azumachan,The dot
15-12-2018T12:22:41,Twokinds,Yeah for the small little hockey puck thing
15-12-2018T12:22:53,Twokinds,The old one is 25 and the new ones are 30
15-12-2018T12:23:00,RimaDraws,ill get the new one
15-12-2018T12:24:01,Twokinds,"Actually, the old dots are on sale for 20 right now. Must be getting rid of their inventory."
15-12-2018T12:26:09,iliar,It is pretty cheap. I thought Alexa costs $200+
15-12-2018T12:27:03,Twokinds,"They do have more expensive ones with better speakers or with screens, but it's not really necessary."
15-12-2018T12:27:12,Twokinds,They can intigrate with any smartphone.
15-12-2018T12:27:34,Twokinds,I'm sure Amazon sells them at near cost just to get people into the ecosystem.
15-12-2018T12:27:44,Twokinds,That's how they get ya.
15-12-2018T12:32:00,Azumachan,I'm knee deed in Google's one

15-12-2018T15:34:17,Aphala,Magic the gathering?
15-12-2018T15:34:20,Twokinds,Yeah
15-12-2018T15:34:24,RimaDraws,oooh
15-12-2018T15:34:28,CrimsonQuill,Never really heard of it...
15-12-2018T15:34:32,Aphala,^ u wot
15-12-2018T15:34:37,CrimsonQuill,I'm more a Halo person.
15-12-2018T15:34:37,Dadrobit,Wut
15-12-2018T15:34:39,Aphala,It's like Adult YuGiOh
15-12-2018T15:34:41,Aphala,But good
15-12-2018T15:34:45,Azumachan,A very expensive card game.
15-12-2018T15:34:47,CrimsonQuill,Ok...
15-12-2018T15:34:58,QuinnMalachite,veeeeeeery expensive
15-12-2018T15:35:00,Twokinds,I still can't understand those weird cards with the arrows and different conditions on them
15-12-2018T15:35:03,Aphala,It's Pokemon trading cards +YuGiOh combined
15-12-2018T15:35:09,Aphala,They do have the PC game as well but...
15-12-2018T15:35:11,Aphala,mm
15-12-2018T15:35:16,Azumachan,Wallets battle.
15-12-2018T15:35:20,CrimsonQuill,"So, like Warhammer 40'000 modelling in cards."
15-12-2018T15:35:24,Aphala,Yes
15-12-2018T15:35:26,CrimsonQuill,I get it
15-12-2018T15:35:29,Twokinds,"I mean, it was the original trading card game"
15-12-2018T15:35:39,Azumachan,Yes
15-12-2018T15:35:41,CrimsonQuill,"At present, I think I'll focus on Asgore."
15-12-2018T15:35:48,Twokinds,It's what yu-gi-oh and pokemon are inspired by.
15-12-2018T15:35:58,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
15-12-2018T15:36:00,Aphala,Dammit man I have to redownload the game!
15-12-2018T15:36:05,Azumachan,Probably 13 years since i played a game.
15-12-2018T15:36:16,CrimsonQuill,I'm in Undertale
15-12-2018T15:36:23,Bgrmystr2,never got into it myself
15-12-2018T15:36:24,CrimsonQuill,Stuck on the last boss...
15-12-2018T15:36:30,QuinnMalachite,"Well 40k can't really be described as pay to win, but most trading card games are pure pay to win loot boxes"
15-12-2018T15:36:30,Aphala,Magic 2015 (on steam) is basically the digital version)
15-12-2018T15:36:47,CrimsonQuill,My sister only died 11 times. I must've died about 40 now.
15-12-2018T15:36:54,Aphala,Quinn you played Eternal Crusade?
15-12-2018T15:36:55,Aphala,lol
15-12-2018T15:37:00,QuinnMalachite,noooooooo
15-12-2018T15:37:02,Aphala,It's lootboxes
15-12-2018T15:37:04,Bgrmystr2,"this is the same stats you said last time, Quill"
15-12-2018T15:37:11,QuinnMalachite,I I stayed the hell out of that
15-12-2018T15:37:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Morning
15-12-2018T15:37:15,Aphala,It's not that bad
15-12-2018T15:37:16,Bgrmystr2,hey marv
15-12-2018T15:37:21,Aphala,Once you cough up money
15-12-2018T15:37:26,Aphala,:expressionless:
15-12-2018T15:37:31,CrimsonQuill,"I don't know what stats I have Bgrm, I lost count around the 40th death."
15-12-2018T15:37:40,CrimsonQuill,Be right back
15-12-2018T15:37:45,QuinnMalachite,"Yeah, It looked like it over promised and planned based on what they could actually do"
15-12-2018T15:38:22,QuinnMalachite,BFG armada 2 looks really good though
15-12-2018T15:38:25,Aphala,Space Marine
15-12-2018T15:38:31,Aphala,Is the penultimate 40K game
15-12-2018T15:38:34,QuinnMalachite,"Yeeeeeeees, that was so good"
15-12-2018T15:38:36,Aphala,EVERYTHING was perfect
15-12-2018T15:38:48,QuinnMalachite,"except the ending, which was a quick time event"
15-12-2018T15:38:52,Bgrmystr2,lol nothing is ever perfect.
15-12-2018T15:38:53,Aphala,Yeah
15-12-2018T15:38:55,QuinnMalachite,but I forgive it for otherwise being fantastic
15-12-2018T15:38:59,Dadrobit,The new Arena game is looking to play way better than the 2015 Steam version so far.
15-12-2018T15:39:02,Aphala,Summon a sorcerer for a bad guy
15-12-2018T15:39:09,Aphala,Classic plot dump
15-12-2018T15:39:14,Aphala,Titus was bad ass though
15-12-2018T15:39:39,Aphala,Dadrobit not heard much about that
15-12-2018T15:39:41,Aphala,Sadly
15-12-2018T15:39:47,QuinnMalachite,"I mean, how many times did Relic pull the ""It was actually me, CHAOS!"" trope"
15-12-2018T15:40:12,Aphala,*laughs in Magnus*
15-12-2018T15:40:14,Dadrobit,"Just got my ass handed to me though. Only drew 4 lands, got absolutey curbstomped ."
15-12-2018T15:40:34,Dadrobit,"It's almost to realistic like that.,"
15-12-2018T15:40:37,Dadrobit,too*
15-12-2018T15:40:37,Aphala,There will always be those hardcore players who dominate in card styles games
15-12-2018T15:40:55,Aphala,Like Hearthstone I have a few easy ones but then BAM like 8 turns it's GG
15-12-2018T15:41:24,Dadrobit,Not much you can do when my initial draw is all I get to play with while the opponent just gets perfect synergy off.
15-12-2018T15:41:26,Twokinds,Is arena new?
15-12-2018T15:41:32,Dadrobit,"Yeah, still in Beta"
15-12-2018T15:41:41,Twokinds,Is it online only?
15-12-2018T15:41:56,Dadrobit,Yeah.

15-12-2018T15:47:23,Shotgunr12,hello
15-12-2018T15:47:26,Aphala,Yo
15-12-2018T15:47:51,Twokinds,"As much as I'd like to, I can't play MTG Arena"
15-12-2018T15:47:54,Twokinds,I like money too much.
15-12-2018T15:48:09,Aphala,I can relate
15-12-2018T15:48:24,Dadrobit,"I mean, FTP is an option still."
15-12-2018T15:48:30,Dadrobit,S'how I do it.
15-12-2018T15:48:34,Twokinds,Don't you have to buy cards?
15-12-2018T15:48:53,CrimsonQuill,I'm back again.
15-12-2018T15:49:02,Aphala,that's the problem with those games it's all fine but the FTP grind to get the a P2P player can be exhausting and not a lot of people have enough time to grind :/
15-12-2018T15:49:04,Twokinds,"Cause I have never bought in game items for any game, and I would not want to start."
15-12-2018T15:49:06,Dadrobit,No. You unlock packs as you play.\
15-12-2018T15:49:17,Twokinds,Well that sounds more reasonable.
15-12-2018T15:49:21,Aphala,Hmm
15-12-2018T15:49:25,RandomTonio,Hello there
15-12-2018T15:49:25,Twokinds,Maybe I will give it a shot then.
15-12-2018T15:49:28,Dadrobit,Though there is the option to buy packs as well.
15-12-2018T15:49:29,RandomTonio,I see changes
15-12-2018T15:49:29,Aphala,Like as challenges ?
15-12-2018T15:50:04,Dadrobit,"Yeah. ""Play 30 Blue spells"" Win 3 Games"" ""Do 10 Damage"""
15-12-2018T15:50:07,RandomTonio,There is one more sketch left...
15-12-2018T15:50:34,Aphala,Not bad
15-12-2018T15:50:37,Aphala,Downloading now
15-12-2018T15:50:42,Dadrobit,"Challenges either give you packs outright, or they give you in game currency to buy packs."
15-12-2018T15:51:21,Dadrobit,Plus you of course start out with 5 pre made decks.
15-12-2018T15:51:30,Sammit,Hi everybody

15-12-2018T15:51:40,Dadrobit,MTG Arena
15-12-2018T15:51:47,Aphala,Seems better than the 2015 one
15-12-2018T15:51:49,Aphala,By far
15-12-2018T15:52:02,SomeDudeNamedQ,hi everyone
15-12-2018T15:52:10,Sammit,Hi Q
15-12-2018T15:52:22,Twokinds,Finally read up on how plainswalkers work
15-12-2018T15:52:25,Dadrobit,"2015 Was always a bit clunky and dated, even in 2015."
15-12-2018T15:52:30,SomeDudeNamedQ,is today the sketch stream or color stream?
15-12-2018T15:52:37,RandomTonio,Sketch
15-12-2018T15:52:53,Bgrmystr2,"mid-month, so sketch"
15-12-2018T15:53:00,Bgrmystr2,colors aren't till the last week of the month
15-12-2018T15:53:03,Aphala,"2015, even 2015 was broken to 2015"
15-12-2018T15:53:10,SomeDudeNamedQ,oh right
15-12-2018T15:53:36,Dadrobit,It was a knee jerk reaction game from Wizards to try and compete with Hearthstone and it showed.
15-12-2018T15:53:44,Aphala,I concur
15-12-2018T15:53:55,Aphala,I hate when companies rush games like that
15-12-2018T15:54:02,Aphala,DOW 3...i'm looking at you
15-12-2018T15:54:10,Aphala,You unpolished jobbie
15-12-2018T15:55:44,Dadrobit,"Hearthstone still has Arena beat by far in visuals, but I still think MTGA is a step up."
15-12-2018T15:56:55,Aphala,I'm waiting for my Stellairs game to end and I might hop on MTGA
15-12-2018T15:57:05,QuinnMalachite,"Oh god, DOW3"
15-12-2018T15:57:17,QuinnMalachite,I was given it for free and I want a refund
15-12-2018T15:57:22,Aphala,It's a shambles
15-12-2018T15:57:25,TerraTheWizard,lol
15-12-2018T15:57:30,Aphala,DOW1 and to an extent 2 were good
15-12-2018T15:57:35,Aphala,But the limited units cap
15-12-2018T15:57:37,Aphala,Really hate that
15-12-2018T15:57:55,QuinnMalachite,"DOW 1 & 2 were very different games, but I really enjoyed both"
15-12-2018T15:57:59,QuinnMalachite,I still play the last stand
15-12-2018T15:58:02,QuinnMalachite,from time to time
15-12-2018T15:58:09,MrMongMong,But nothing can ever surpass Mass Effect Andromeda in brokenness
15-12-2018T15:58:11,Aphala,Total Annihilation will be the penultimate RTS
15-12-2018T15:58:22,Aphala,It's got everything right
15-12-2018T15:58:27,SomeDudeNamedQ,I spent my fair share of money on TCGs when I was in middle/high school
15-12-2018T15:58:36,SomeDudeNamedQ,that was enough for me

15-12-2018T15:59:31,Bgrmystr2,even the original creators couldn't make a true successor.
15-12-2018T15:59:36,Aphala,Exactly
15-12-2018T15:59:44,Bgrmystr2,"and they tried 3 times,"
15-12-2018T15:59:46,Aphala,I mean Sup Com 1 was alright but dang

15-12-2018T20:46:27,Bgrmystr2,"I live here too, so there's that."
15-12-2018T20:46:48,Ordithus,Phew what a day

15-12-2018T20:47:43,BadFoMo,"So, are Maddie and Maeve supposed to end up together?"
15-12-2018T20:47:50,MarshallMelon,Probably not
15-12-2018T20:47:51,RimaDraws,who knows
15-12-2018T20:48:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,Have a goodnight everyone!  Enjoyed the stream and talking with everyone!  Hopefully next week Adelaide kissing Nat naked and under the mistletoe and giving both Flora and Keith sword tail will get picked next week!
15-12-2018T20:48:04,Aphala,I mean Magpie is just Magpie
15-12-2018T20:48:07,MarshallMelon,"Maddie still has/had a crush on Keith, remember"
15-12-2018T20:48:08,Aphala,She's a solo agent
15-12-2018T20:48:09,Ordithus,"In sketchland, which is 110% canon, yes"
15-12-2018T20:48:11,Aphala,I suspect
15-12-2018T20:48:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanna see if Kat or Trace baking cookies or my other sketch would do good
15-12-2018T20:49:11,Aphala,Kat should be solo
15-12-2018T20:49:22,Aphala,Eric is a poon hound
15-12-2018T20:49:33,HeresyArtStream,later
15-12-2018T20:49:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Since baking cookies isn‚Äôt as strictly Christmas related, I‚Äôm probably gonna keep to my original and just save the others"
15-12-2018T20:49:36,RimaDraws,well i hope i can make the stream next week

15-12-2018T20:50:08,Aphala,Eric is a horn dog but he thinks of her as a sister
15-12-2018T20:50:33,Aphala,Other than Zen who can she go with
15-12-2018T20:50:37,Aphala,:P
15-12-2018T20:50:56,MarshallMelon,Honestly I've found it much more enjoyable to stop submitting suggestions
15-12-2018T20:51:09,MarshallMelon,These streams are best experienced as a spectator
15-12-2018T20:51:11,Aphala,I can agreed
15-12-2018T20:51:30,Ordithus,I like suggesting things. My happiness isn't dependent on it being drawn
15-12-2018T20:51:34,Aphala,If everyone let Tom do this thing
15-12-2018T20:51:34,Ordithus,"I just have fun, anyways"

15-12-2018T20:52:21,Ordithus,"Though, I must admit, it is a treat to have a suggestion drawn"

15-12-2018T21:13:04,Bgrmystr2,"I just listened to late 70s, early 80s, classic rock, etc"
15-12-2018T21:13:20,Aphala,Everyone pretends that they're not edgy
15-12-2018T21:13:22,RimaDraws,i listen to some dark stuff

15-12-2018T21:13:41,Destro35,I am young
15-12-2018T21:13:48,Aphala,Can't fault classic rock
15-12-2018T21:13:55,Bgrmystr2,"Techno, eurobeat, bluegrass"

15-12-2018T21:14:36,Destro35,What defines an edgy moment
15-12-2018T21:14:46,Ordithus,"I'm not familiar, Rima."
15-12-2018T21:14:47,Aphala,You never had a music phase?!
15-12-2018T21:14:52,Aphala,I find that hard to belive
15-12-2018T21:14:54,RimaDraws,i had some music phases

15-12-2018T21:15:06,Ordithus,Music phase? Sure.  Edgy?  No.
15-12-2018T21:15:31,Bgrmystr2,"I listen to music all the time, changed between genres, but I never had Edgy phase no"
15-12-2018T21:15:43,Destro35,"I am into classical, techno, and a little bit of Christian"
15-12-2018T21:15:46,Bgrmystr2,there's so many genres out there
15-12-2018T21:15:49,Aphala,But surely the music you'd listen to was 'against the grain'
15-12-2018T21:15:53,RimaDraws,i didn't have an edgy phase till after high school i think?
15-12-2018T21:15:53,Ordithus,"Like, waaay back, I listened to almost exclusively classical and jazz"

15-12-2018T21:26:28,Bgrmystr2,"People take advantage of saying ""I'm sick"" and they're not sick, they just want to get paid without going in to work"
15-12-2018T21:26:33,Bgrmystr2,it's a bad practice
15-12-2018T21:26:38,Aphala,True but we don't usually do that
15-12-2018T21:26:39,Aphala,:D

15-12-2018T21:28:59,MarshallMelon,To be fair stuff like holidays is subjective in the US depending on job/state
15-12-2018T21:29:04,Aphala,Trust me UK / EU have it sorted
15-12-2018T21:29:16,Aphala,No fuck about Tax is REALLY serious in the UK
15-12-2018T21:29:17,MarshallMelon,The only thing I would genuinely fault them for is healthcare

15-12-2018T21:29:55,MarshallMelon,"If you have to lose your house and savings to get life-saving care, something's wrong"

15-12-2018T21:31:55,MarshallMelon,The thing that amazes me is how the GOP fights universal healthcare with such vigor
15-12-2018T21:31:56,Aphala,Weird ass Yellow buggery
15-12-2018T21:32:05,MarshallMelon,"Like, it's been proven to work almost everywhere. What's the risk?"
15-12-2018T21:32:18,MarshallMelon,Aside from losing M O N E Y
15-12-2018T21:32:37,Aphala,I guess the US has a MASSIVE reliance on healthcare

15-12-2018T21:34:51,Aphala,haha
15-12-2018T21:34:55,Aphala,True
15-12-2018T21:34:55,MarshallMelon,"No, seriously"
15-12-2018T21:35:06,MarshallMelon,It's got a lot of people worried
15-12-2018T21:35:19,Aphala,He needs to forget about CHINA and focus on the US
15-12-2018T21:35:20,MarshallMelon,Seeing as he has control over the nukes and whatnot
15-12-2018T21:35:55,Aphala,He's weirdly childish
15-12-2018T21:36:09,Aphala,I suppose no one is perfect
15-12-2018T21:36:10,MarshallMelon,"Narcissism, mixed with dementia"
15-12-2018T21:36:19,Aphala,I mean we have May
15-12-2018T21:36:19,MarshallMelon,His mind's slowly breaking down
15-12-2018T21:36:20,Aphala,....
15-12-2018T21:36:32,Aphala,May is a mong
15-12-2018T21:36:35,Aphala,100%
15-12-2018T21:36:45,Aphala,She's shitting her frilliies
15-12-2018T21:36:50,Bgrmystr2,"I'd fully support a nationwide healthcare like other countries, it's just everyone who wrote up the one we have now have NO FUCKING IDEA how national health care is supposed to work."
15-12-2018T21:37:06,Bgrmystr2,or why it works the way it does.
15-12-2018T21:37:17,Bgrmystr2,so.. we're stuck with garbage
15-12-2018T21:37:24,MarshallMelon,To be fair your current system is so ingrained that just suddenly making an AHS or whatever wouldn't work
15-12-2018T21:37:31,Aphala,If you had federal healthcare plan that made sense to the world it'd be fine :P
15-12-2018T21:37:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's also true
15-12-2018T21:37:38,MarshallMelon,"Obama was right, it has to be a slow adoption process"
15-12-2018T21:37:40,MarshallMelon,Bit by bit
15-12-2018T21:37:46,Aphala,You always have Federal / State lawas
15-12-2018T21:37:49,Aphala,VERY confusing
15-12-2018T21:37:55,Aphala,Stop it :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
15-12-2018T21:37:58,Bgrmystr2,the problem is that you'll never get anywhere with slow process lol
15-12-2018T21:38:12,Aphala,Uniform law makes more sense tbhat
15-12-2018T21:38:14,MarshallMelon,Good ol' two-party system in action
15-12-2018T21:38:18,Aphala,^
15-12-2018T21:38:29,Bgrmystr2,cuz it takes years to make each change and then it barely changes much and it takes even longer for it to actually make a noticable change in the real world
15-12-2018T21:38:39,Bgrmystr2,you never get anywhere
15-12-2018T21:38:42,Aphala,We have mtuples in the UK sure it's arse most of the time but we have choice
15-12-2018T21:38:54,Aphala,Coms  / Libs
15-12-2018T21:38:55,MarshallMelon,Not that the ACA ever got a chance to shine. Pity really
15-12-2018T21:39:22,Aphala,Liberals hate the right < Cons hate those commie tier rights
15-12-2018T21:39:27,Aphala,It's all backwards
15-12-2018T21:39:35,Aphala,Not all libs want immigrants
15-12-2018T21:39:57,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know why having healthcare is so difficult... it's an amount everyone pays, and it covers literally everyone in the country."
15-12-2018T21:39:58,Aphala,Not all cons want Hetro only systems
15-12-2018T21:40:10,Aphala,Plus US is MASSIVE
15-12-2018T21:40:14,MarshallMelon,"Because politics, Bgr"
15-12-2018T21:40:24,Aphala,US is huge can't fault that
15-12-2018T21:40:24,MarshallMelon,"If the Dems want something, the Reps have to crush it"
15-12-2018T21:40:32,Bgrmystr2,"none of this insurance shit, you just pay the healcare tax thing, it goes to healthcare, and EVERYONE is covered. But no"
15-12-2018T21:40:34,Aphala,But there is a better system parity
15-12-2018T21:40:34,MarshallMelon,"It's really childish, but it's what happens"
15-12-2018T21:40:48,MarshallMelon,Partisan politics
15-12-2018T21:40:55,Aphala,True we can't comment UK has a totally wank system
15-12-2018T21:40:57,Bgrmystr2,we're charging people even morer money simply cuz they can't afford healthcare in the first place..
15-12-2018T21:41:15,Bgrmystr2,who the fuck even.. came up with that
15-12-2018T21:41:15,MarshallMelon,"Big Pharma, Big Hospital etc."
15-12-2018T21:41:21,MarshallMelon,Lobbyists won't allow it
15-12-2018T21:41:29,Bgrmystr2,they're the problem really
15-12-2018T21:41:39,Aphala,Lobbyist systems is so fucking broke
15-12-2018T21:41:45,Aphala,Cut that
15-12-2018T21:41:47,Aphala,Firstr
15-12-2018T21:41:54,Aphala,Really remove it
15-12-2018T21:41:58,Aphala,It's so bad
15-12-2018T21:42:02,Aphala,Ruining the US
15-12-2018T21:42:05,MarshallMelon,Thing is to cut the lobbying system you'd have to get the senators to vote for it
15-12-2018T21:42:09,Ordithus,"It's strange how popular an idea universal healthcare is, but it's not popular in congress"
15-12-2018T21:42:11,MarshallMelon,Guess who benefits from lobbying?
15-12-2018T21:42:30,Aphala,I mean as a Scot from the UK i'd rather have the US healthy
15-12-2018T21:42:35,Bgrmystr2,It's not illegal for corps to give lots of money so they get something that only benefits them. That's one of the biggest issues methinks. and it's really unfortunate
15-12-2018T21:42:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz everyone loses
15-12-2018T21:42:43,Aphala,First world represent!
15-12-2018T21:42:59,MarshallMelon,That good ol' Citizens United case
15-12-2018T21:43:06,MarshallMelon,What a GOOD THING that turned out to be
15-12-2018T21:43:27,MarshallMelon,Not
15-12-2018T21:43:30,Aphala,Only problem is the US is under some weird liberal paranoid system
15-12-2018T21:43:33,Bgrmystr2,there's so much fucked.. :ptv-uneasy:
15-12-2018T21:43:40,Aphala,The left isn't attacking you
15-12-2018T21:43:46,Aphala,The media hupe is
15-12-2018T21:43:49,Aphala,hype*
15-12-2018T21:43:56,MarshallMelon,"That's more of a historical thing, Aph"
15-12-2018T21:44:02,Aphala,True
15-12-2018T21:44:09,Bgrmystr2,"everyone's attacking everyone, it's been that way for a very long time"
15-12-2018T21:44:10,MarshallMelon,Red Scare in the Twenties. Cold War in the post-war period
15-12-2018T21:44:12,Bgrmystr2,fighting for control
15-12-2018T21:44:20,Bgrmystr2,and using fear to gain power
15-12-2018T21:44:45,Aphala,I genuinely wish that the US gets big again
15-12-2018T21:44:53,MarshallMelon,...it is?
15-12-2018T21:45:00,unsteddyphoenix,Or great again?
15-12-2018T21:45:04,Aphala,Like 1940s big
15-12-2018T21:45:12,Aphala,Nothing like is is now
15-12-2018T21:45:13,MarshallMelon,"As in ""half the world owes us money"" big"
15-12-2018T21:45:18,MarshallMelon,"Yeah, not a good idea"
15-12-2018T21:45:25,Ordithus,"You mean, when we were the only country not burnt to the ground by a horrible war?"
15-12-2018T21:45:28,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it is, but it was never great to begin with.. There was always problems even in the early days of the country"
15-12-2018T21:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,^
15-12-2018T21:45:42,Aphala,Money is a weird bullshit conecpt
15-12-2018T21:45:43,RimaDraws,hm...
15-12-2018T21:45:45,Ordithus,"That's why the US dominated, didn't get blown to smithereens"
15-12-2018T21:45:47,Bgrmystr2,"so we can't become great ""again"" cuz we'd have to have been great in the past to start with.."
15-12-2018T21:45:51,Ordithus,^
15-12-2018T21:45:59,MarshallMelon,Roaring Twenties were okay
15-12-2018T21:46:07,MarshallMelon,Before that little kerfuffle at the end
15-12-2018T21:46:09,Ordithus,Then :fire:
15-12-2018T21:46:17,Aphala,if the EU solidifies as a commitment we'd be top dog
15-12-2018T21:46:23,Ordithus,"Though that was pre Civil rights, so still shit"
15-12-2018T21:46:24,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a video on that you know
15-12-2018T21:46:27,Aphala,but you know immigration
15-12-2018T21:46:28,Aphala,lol
15-12-2018T21:46:43,MarshallMelon,"From an economic standpoint though, the 1920s were great"
15-12-2018T21:46:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains how US was never great and all that
15-12-2018T21:46:47,Aphala,One day we'll just be EARTH nothing more
15-12-2018T21:46:49,MarshallMelon,Until that one little thing
15-12-2018T21:46:57,Aphala,Dam south africa though
15-12-2018T21:47:01,Ordithus,It was just a lil hiccup
15-12-2018T21:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Seen it, Bgr?"
15-12-2018T21:47:09,MarshallMelon,A lil' speedbump
15-12-2018T21:47:19,Bgrmystr2,uh.. probably not Kiwi
15-12-2018T21:47:36,Bgrmystr2,don't know of any videos talking about it
15-12-2018T21:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I can shoot it to you if you want
15-12-2018T21:47:42,Aphala,How about the US and UK combine as a power force
15-12-2018T21:47:45,Bgrmystr2,sure
15-12-2018T21:47:49,Aphala,We'd fucking mince everyone
15-12-2018T21:47:50,Bgrmystr2,I can watch it sometime later

15-12-2018T21:48:19,Aphala,We can make a VERY LARGE BRIDGE :ctwokinds-maevecute:

15-12-2018T21:48:49,Bgrmystr2,"lol, the war for independance and..? :o"
15-12-2018T21:48:52,RimaDraws,i dont come here to talk politics

15-12-2018T21:49:03,MarshallMelon,"Neither do I, this is kind of an outlier"
15-12-2018T21:49:04,Aphala,Some time
15-12-2018T21:49:09,Aphala,I guess
15-12-2018T21:49:18,MarshallMelon,That won't end well for you
15-12-2018T21:49:22,MarshallMelon,Not at first anyway
15-12-2018T21:49:29,Aphala,I dunno we've got most of the oil
15-12-2018T21:49:36,MarshallMelon,Your microeconomy isn't big enough
15-12-2018T21:49:47,Bgrmystr2,ahh there was a second war of independance
15-12-2018T21:49:50,Aphala,I mean we can produce A LOT of whisky
15-12-2018T21:49:51,Bgrmystr2,okay
15-12-2018T21:50:08,Bgrmystr2,my memory of class is fuzzy

15-12-2018T21:52:17,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure if I'm just remembering both wars as one.. or if they only talked about one..
15-12-2018T21:52:38,Bgrmystr2,feelsbad :C
15-12-2018T21:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"As for the he I was asking about being gone earlier , it was Aphala"
15-12-2018T21:52:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah I figured
15-12-2018T21:52:56,Ordithus,Yeeeah
15-12-2018T21:53:19,RimaDraws,>>
15-12-2018T21:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I was hoping he‚Äôd go so I could jump in but after a bit I just decided to ignore
15-12-2018T21:53:40,Bgrmystr2,"he wasn't the only problem imo, but least it's over now."
15-12-2018T21:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not talking about the apparent obsession with politics
15-12-2018T21:54:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Thought that was admittedly dull
15-12-2018T21:54:19,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-12-2018T21:54:23,Ordithus,The earlier bit?
15-12-2018T21:54:26,RimaDraws,im glad he is gone
15-12-2018T21:54:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Ring a ding ding Ord
15-12-2018T21:54:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just ew

15-12-2018T21:54:51,Ordithus,Yeah
15-12-2018T21:54:54,Bgrmystr2,"I would feel the same Rima, but he's just one of many."
15-12-2018T21:55:21,RimaDraws,i just dont want to be here with people i enjoy company with and talk politics. its not what i want to get into
15-12-2018T21:55:31,MarshallMelon,Seems we've had an influx them in the last few months
15-12-2018T21:55:34,MarshallMelon,No idea why
15-12-2018T21:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"In the meantime, I managed to get Bagheera to let me balance my nailclppers on his head"
15-12-2018T21:55:45,Ordithus,lol
15-12-2018T21:55:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I was more amused than him
15-12-2018T21:55:55,Ordithus,I bet
15-12-2018T21:56:02,Ordithus,Kitty not amused
15-12-2018T21:56:09,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
15-12-2018T21:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúAnd how is this entertaining to you?‚Äù
15-12-2018T21:56:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And a little of ‚ÄúThere. Happy now?‚Äù
15-12-2018T21:56:57,Ordithus,"I get that, Rima.  Politics is rarely fun to discuss"
15-12-2018T21:57:18,MarshallMelon,"Huh, weird. Iliar's account is flagged as being a bot"
15-12-2018T21:57:28,RimaDraws,i just want to enjoy being here in chat. i know i can't make people not say things but i just don't like that..
15-12-2018T21:57:29,Ordithus,It is
15-12-2018T21:57:40,MarshallMelon,Okay then
15-12-2018T21:57:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's been that way
15-12-2018T21:57:50,MarshallMelon,Never noticed I guess
15-12-2018T21:58:17,Bgrmystr2,cuz he's got bot stuff going on his account to record the stream and such
15-12-2018T21:58:23,Bgrmystr2,it's all automatic
15-12-2018T21:58:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Iliar: ü§ñ
15-12-2018T21:58:43,MarshallMelon,"Ah yeah, that'd make sense. Although he could just use OBS on the archives"
15-12-2018T21:58:51,Ordithus,What has me concerned is Nibblybot occasionally Nibblys now
15-12-2018T21:59:04,SpazztasticKiwi,She has become aware
15-12-2018T21:59:07,Bgrmystr2,that's kinda pointless when you can just download the archive the website saves
15-12-2018T21:59:20,MarshallMelon,Back in ye olde days you couldn't
15-12-2018T21:59:22,Bgrmystr2,he records it in case the site recording fails
15-12-2018T21:59:44,Ordithus,The site recording also only goes back so far
15-12-2018T21:59:53,MarshallMelon,"12 at a time, with reserved slots"
15-12-2018T21:59:58,MarshallMelon,So more like 8
15-12-2018T22:00:01,Bgrmystr2,and yeah it's actually been possible to download them far back as I can remember
15-12-2018T22:00:24,Bgrmystr2,I think I was around when picarto implemented recordings
15-12-2018T22:00:31,Bgrmystr2,it's been a couple years?
15-12-2018T22:00:33,MarshallMelon,Early 2017
15-12-2018T22:00:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah see
15-12-2018T22:00:43,MarshallMelon,Or at least that's when Tom turned them on
15-12-2018T22:00:54,Bgrmystr2,Fluff as well
15-12-2018T22:01:03,MarshallMelon,Earliest recording dates from around early February '17

15-12-2018T22:01:06,SpazztasticKiwi,...
15-12-2018T22:01:19,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-condescending:
15-12-2018T22:01:29,MarshallMelon,I've got a couple of older ones recorded though
15-12-2018T22:01:34,MarshallMelon,"Not many, but some"
15-12-2018T22:01:46,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah they were downloadable all back then too, just gotta know your way around how the website hosts the files on the server and stuff"
15-12-2018T22:01:51,Bgrmystr2,and haha kiwi
15-12-2018T22:01:53,Bgrmystr2,yes
15-12-2018T22:01:59,Bgrmystr2,that is my feel.
15-12-2018T22:02:01,MarshallMelon,"Or in my case, idle the PC overnight with OBS running"
15-12-2018T22:02:20,MarshallMelon,"Not efficient, but it worked"
15-12-2018T22:02:38,MarshallMelon,Mostly
15-12-2018T22:03:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Feels like the more we go towards quicker, easier, and more compact, the worse we get"
15-12-2018T22:03:31,MarshallMelon,From a software perspective maybe
15-12-2018T22:03:34,MarshallMelon,Tech on the other hand
15-12-2018T22:03:58,Bgrmystr2,Software is becoming less and less user-friendly
15-12-2018T22:04:04,Bgrmystr2,and becoming more and more a nanny
15-12-2018T22:04:09,Bgrmystr2,holding your hand and doing everything for you
15-12-2018T22:04:23,MarshallMelon,Or trying to grab as much cash as possible out of you
15-12-2018T22:04:27,Bgrmystr2,"it's so bad, I'm legit kind of afraid of where it's going"
15-12-2018T22:04:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah that too
15-12-2018T22:04:30,MarshallMelon,App stores are wastelands now
15-12-2018T22:04:46,MarshallMelon,Yeah I feel you. Haven't installed my webcam in over a year
15-12-2018T22:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder how a zombie outbreak would effect things nearly every year
15-12-2018T22:04:51,Bgrmystr2,"I don't even want a smartphone, I haven't seen a single damn thing it can do that I'd want."
15-12-2018T22:05:04,MarshallMelon,Portable internet tho
15-12-2018T22:05:04,Bgrmystr2,"Mine calls and texts, and that's what a phone should do."
15-12-2018T22:05:12,Bgrmystr2,that costs so much money lol
15-12-2018T22:05:13,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-12-2018T22:05:13,Ordithus,Navigation is nice
15-12-2018T22:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,On one hand we have tech and the means and some of the smarts to stop it or nip the bud
15-12-2018T22:05:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"On the other, it could spread cause tech has made some so unconnected to our own abilities"
15-12-2018T22:05:47,MarshallMelon,If I didn't have a palm-sized internet machine on my commute I'd go mental
15-12-2018T22:05:59,MarshallMelon,"Trains are already crap, it just dulls the pain"
15-12-2018T22:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Know something else I wonder?
15-12-2018T22:06:29,Bgrmystr2,I don't see any reason to need it lol
15-12-2018T22:06:37,SpazztasticKiwi,How many people would try a selfie with a zombie
15-12-2018T22:06:44,MarshallMelon,"Yeah, well, YOU don't have to brave London every day"
15-12-2018T22:06:45,RimaDraws,not me
15-12-2018T22:06:50,Bgrmystr2,"I've never had mobile internet, and never needed it xD"

15-12-2018T22:07:09,Bgrmystr2,"I have, however, braved the streets of orleans everyday."

15-12-2018T22:07:47,Bgrmystr2,"though I guess if I had a smartphone, someone would just steal it lol"

15-12-2018T22:19:57,RimaDraws,yea i drew that for fun. it was done digitally after i drew the paper sketch in october
15-12-2018T22:21:31,RimaDraws,i think in the new year im gonna be doing more TK fan art and AI fan art. plus more free public posts on patreon for others to see
15-12-2018T22:22:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Y‚Äôall think I jumped too quick with that Aphala thing...?
15-12-2018T22:22:26,Ordithus,No
15-12-2018T22:22:36,Bgrmystr2,how do you mean? Like jumped ship?
15-12-2018T22:22:51,Bgrmystr2,cuz I don't think so
15-12-2018T22:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I jumped cause of that and he said himself that he had a knack to be annoying for fun or something like that
15-12-2018T22:24:30,Ordithus,"Honestly, I feel like I failed you and Rima"
15-12-2018T22:24:34,Bgrmystr2,He seems to have a severe lack of understanding of how that works
15-12-2018T22:24:42,RimaDraws,i can usually handle myself
15-12-2018T22:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs just maybe it was that or he was being creepy
15-12-2018T22:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to vote mainly for the latter
15-12-2018T22:25:39,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, Rima was adding fuel to the fire, giving him another target rather than letting the guy burn himself out"
15-12-2018T22:25:49,Bgrmystr2,"ye old addage, don't feed the troll"
15-12-2018T22:25:55,Bgrmystr2,it applies.
15-12-2018T22:26:08,RimaDraws,im sorry but i dont let people run me over
15-12-2018T22:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ord, i think you were just fine. It wasn‚Äôt an outright sexual comment, but something creepy"
15-12-2018T22:26:27,Ordithus,He... was misbehaving the whole bloody time
15-12-2018T22:26:41,RimaDraws,not to be discriminative but hes a brit
15-12-2018T22:26:46,RimaDraws,they're all mischievious

15-12-2018T23:11:58,Ordithus,"If you're asking me, no, I already found him"
15-12-2018T23:12:05,Ordithus,When I made that comment

15-12-2018T23:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I am curious as to how Mark keeps his all-white car interior clean
15-12-2018T23:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd be terrified of having white seating
15-12-2018T23:20:21,Ordithus,Clean it all the time?  With dogs you have to clean the interior constantly anyways
15-12-2018T23:20:31,Ordithus,Unless you want to live in a hairy mess
15-12-2018T23:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Best friend is a vacuum
15-12-2018T23:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,He has a rather attractive car though I‚Äôll say
15-12-2018T23:23:05,Ordithus,what is his car?
15-12-2018T23:23:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Tesla X
15-12-2018T23:23:26,Ordithus,Really? Cool
15-12-2018T23:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd likely never try one but it‚Äôs good lookin
15-12-2018T23:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if you know what an X looks like, try the Roadster"
15-12-2018T23:24:59,SpazztasticKiwi,That. Is a sexy car
15-12-2018T23:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Course I only admire. They‚Äôre not practical. Just for looks
15-12-2018T23:25:33,Ordithus,Old or new?
15-12-2018T23:25:48,SpazztasticKiwi,His X? A year old I think
15-12-2018T23:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,He did a video a bit ago and my memory‚Äôs still not good on it
15-12-2018T23:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,He mentioned swapping it out from the S model so he‚Äôd have the extra room the X gives for Chica to travel
15-12-2018T23:26:55,Ordithus,"The roadster is what I meant.  There's one coming out soon, but the old Roadster was Tesla's first cr"
15-12-2018T23:26:57,Ordithus,*car
15-12-2018T23:27:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah the new
15-12-2018T23:27:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He put up a vid about the free Roadster after 50 or something referrals
15-12-2018T23:27:51,Ordithus,"Yeah, that is a pretty car.  Ludicrous fast"
15-12-2018T23:29:29,SpazztasticKiwi,0-60 in a second or something right
15-12-2018T23:30:15,Ordithus,A bit longer than that
15-12-2018T23:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone who gets that thing isn‚Äôt gonna go just 60
15-12-2018T23:30:19,Bgrmystr2,I dunno I'm not a big fan of the design of Tesla's cars
15-12-2018T23:30:25,Bgrmystr2,"the physical design, specifically"
15-12-2018T23:30:35,Ordithus,But still way faster than is sensible
15-12-2018T23:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a car in Ifunny being made fun of cause it looked like a calculator cover
15-12-2018T23:30:53,SpazztasticKiwi,And you know what? It did

15-12-2018T23:31:31,Ordithus,I like the exterior of Teslas.  The inside... not as much
15-12-2018T23:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,But the Tesla isn‚Äôt terribly sensible to me eithter

15-12-2018T23:31:58,Bgrmystr2,yes exactly
15-12-2018T23:31:59,Bgrmystr2,I hate it
15-12-2018T23:32:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh but not bubble cars
15-12-2018T23:32:03,Bgrmystr2,the sleek round.. not a fan
15-12-2018T23:32:14,Ordithus,What car is more your style?
15-12-2018T23:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you ever seen the actual bubble car?
15-12-2018T23:32:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Google something like ‚Äúbubble car‚Äù
15-12-2018T23:32:35,Twokinds,All cars look the same to me.
15-12-2018T23:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It looks like what would happen if you farted in a smart car
15-12-2018T23:32:51,unsteddyphoenix,Some cars are red and some arent red.
15-12-2018T23:32:55,Bgrmystr2,"the sharp jagged stuff, cars that have a style.. I like uhh"

15-12-2018T23:33:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom I have a feeling you just look for something with wheels
15-12-2018T23:33:27,Twokinds,Well I didn't buy it
15-12-2018T23:33:47,unsteddyphoenix,You find it?
15-12-2018T23:34:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I figured you would just get a car even if you preferred it be red
15-12-2018T23:34:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if you went shopping and found yourself a red one, cool"
15-12-2018T23:34:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause otherwise your mother or Mark got it

15-12-2018T23:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Kill it with fire
15-12-2018T23:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Before it reproduces
15-12-2018T23:36:11,Bgrmystr2,"no, I like stuff like the 1965 GTO https://classics.autotrader.com/classic-cars/1965/pontiac/gto/101055741"

15-12-2018T23:37:23,Bgrmystr2,or the Roadster version of it
15-12-2018T23:37:33,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Good find.
15-12-2018T23:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I‚Äôve said, I like the Bugatti"
15-12-2018T23:37:42,Bgrmystr2,"I'm torn, cuz the roadster is badass lookin and the normal SV has the roof scoops"
15-12-2018T23:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,The color changing one
15-12-2018T23:38:04,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really care about the engine or whatnot, it's really the design  of the car that gets my fancy"

15-12-2018T23:38:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"But as for real life cars I‚Äôd actually get and don‚Äôt just like the looks of, I‚Äôm a Chevy Cruze person"
15-12-2018T23:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Simple
15-12-2018T23:39:00,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, the Scion xB was also one of the more recent cars I liked, cuz at the time.. of all the cars trying to be all round and uniform, it said fuck you guys, I'm a box."
15-12-2018T23:39:19,Ordithus,"haha, yeah, it did.  But it was still ugly as sin"
15-12-2018T23:39:28,Bgrmystr2,I think that's part of why I liked it
15-12-2018T23:39:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz I absolutely hate the same-y look of all the cars everyone drives
15-12-2018T23:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôm a box‚Äù
15-12-2018T23:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Beautiful

15-12-2018T23:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd prefer you burn it
15-12-2018T23:42:11,Bgrmystr2,I kinda wanna burn it.. then pop it so all the pieces are small enough to burn up in the air and disappear.
15-12-2018T23:42:24,Bgrmystr2,disappears without a trace
