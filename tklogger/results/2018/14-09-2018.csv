14-09-2018T00:00:35,LEgGOdt1,Please share
14-09-2018T00:00:40,SageSaga,"it was like - ""Hi, my brother used my account and cheated, my father will tell you. Hi, the father is typing now, it's true, his little brother did it"""
14-09-2018T00:00:42,Ordithus,And my axe!

14-09-2018T00:01:06,Dadrobit,Seem plausible
14-09-2018T00:01:12,Dadrobit,Seems*
14-09-2018T00:01:56,Bgrmystr2,lol totally convincing..
14-09-2018T00:02:26,LEgGOdt1,T_T... the person in question was banned from a game because their younger brother was cheating on their account?
14-09-2018T00:02:46,Bgrmystr2,it's probably bs
14-09-2018T00:02:55,LEgGOdt1,I agree
14-09-2018T00:03:03,Bgrmystr2,"there's likely no brother, ppl just make up excuses like that all the time"
14-09-2018T00:04:12,Combak,"To be fair, even if there was a brother, they might be able to get banned for account sharing."
14-09-2018T00:04:31,Bgrmystr2,I don't think acount sharing is a bannable offense..?
14-09-2018T00:05:08,Twokinds,I'm starting to run low on steam
14-09-2018T00:05:11,Bgrmystr2,"but even if it were true, why is he letting brother play on his acct anyway"
14-09-2018T00:05:16,unsteddyphoenix,get a new account?
14-09-2018T00:05:16,LEgGOdt1,Yeah it can be since if they've done something that violated the EUA

14-09-2018T00:06:36,LEgGOdt1,To get their account ban then they try getting on the site through someone else's account to only get that person's account banned without them even knowing
14-09-2018T00:06:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,says you Bgr
14-09-2018T00:06:53,Bgrmystr2,"if you tounge dry, you broken, marv"

14-09-2018T00:08:44,unsteddyphoenix,Considering he's...hopeless.

14-09-2018T00:38:47,SageSaga,it's only 20 miles away instead of 40
14-09-2018T00:38:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Awesome
14-09-2018T00:38:54,Twokinds,...movie?
14-09-2018T00:38:56,Twokinds,I thought it was an anime
14-09-2018T00:38:59,FluffKevlar,ive been meaning to watch macademia
14-09-2018T00:39:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,And now its a movie

14-09-2018T00:39:43,SageSaga,a bit of history about All Might

14-09-2018T00:41:26,SageSaga,you should
14-09-2018T00:41:52,unsteddyphoenix,Its decent
14-09-2018T00:41:55,w0lfmare,My favorite anime I'd say
14-09-2018T00:42:04,unsteddyphoenix,New age Naruto
14-09-2018T00:42:07,SageSaga,the Dub is available on VRV
14-09-2018T00:42:10,unsteddyphoenix,But before Naruto became awful
14-09-2018T00:42:35,MrEase,"its really solid, and its more focused on the characters than the action itself"
14-09-2018T00:42:49,unsteddyphoenix,Oh the action scenes are good though
14-09-2018T00:42:59,Bgrmystr2,"I've seen the dub a couple times, not a fan of the voices at all"
14-09-2018T00:43:03,MrEase,and the action is only in service of the characters and the world
14-09-2018T00:43:27,SageSaga,The voices for the dub arent bad- some could be better but not bad
14-09-2018T00:43:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Plus inevitably someone will make an abridged series, so we get that too!"
14-09-2018T00:44:14,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, just watched the newest part of DBZA earlier, so good."
14-09-2018T00:44:15,SageSaga,there is one
14-09-2018T00:44:33,SageSaga,and Takahata from DBZA and Hellsing Ultimate Abridged is doing All Might
14-09-2018T00:44:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hype
14-09-2018T00:44:53,unsteddyphoenix,I enjoyed Vegeta's *[MY BABY BOY!!!!]

14-09-2018T00:46:09,MrEase,I gotta say though the Hero Aca dub's biggest strength is the VA for Deku who actually was in DBZ abridged as Adult Gohan in the history of trunks special
14-09-2018T00:46:10,Twokinds,They beat Cell?!
14-09-2018T00:46:14,Twokinds,"Darn it, unsteddy!"

14-09-2018T00:50:14,Bgrmystr2,I always liked Cell in DBZA
14-09-2018T00:50:35,MrEase,"Nappa, Android 16, Cell, Super Kami Guru"
14-09-2018T00:50:43,MrEase,basically all the funniest ones
14-09-2018T00:50:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,GURU!!!! \o/
14-09-2018T00:50:56,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah Cell was one of them where the voice was really accurate to the actual show
14-09-2018T00:51:32,unsteddyphoenix,I remember Nappa being HILARIOUS
14-09-2018T00:51:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,still is
14-09-2018T00:52:17,ZRO4825,"Just got done watching that myself, actually"
14-09-2018T00:52:42,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-RainezZz: Good night, Tom, Sage, fellas.  Thanks for the stream!"
14-09-2018T00:52:49,unsteddyphoenix,later ord

14-09-2018T00:53:53,SageSaga,Do people know about next week?
14-09-2018T00:53:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the stream Tom
14-09-2018T00:54:02,Twokinds,I'm not here next week
14-09-2018T00:54:08,ZRO4825,What's next week? Post-Florence week?
14-09-2018T00:54:20,unsteddyphoenix,Thanks for streaming Tom! Good work~
14-09-2018T00:54:20,InTheLionsDen,One week or two?
14-09-2018T00:54:24,Twokinds,Next week I'll be in Korea
14-09-2018T00:54:26,Zakuru,"nighty tom, thanks for the streams"
14-09-2018T00:54:31,Twokinds,Two weeks
14-09-2018T00:54:34,MrEase,oh cool
14-09-2018T00:54:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Have fun TOm
14-09-2018T00:54:52,Bgrmystr2,Thanks for streaming tom :D!
14-09-2018T00:54:55,HeresyArtStream,Night Tom!
14-09-2018T00:54:56,Twokinds,Byeee
14-09-2018T00:54:59,Bgrmystr2,Enjoy your trip man
14-09-2018T00:55:01,MrEase,have a goodnight everybody
14-09-2018T00:55:06,FluffKevlar,later
14-09-2018T00:55:51,unsteddyphoenix,bye bye~
14-09-2018T00:55:58,thestooge,bye Tom! good night guys!
14-09-2018T00:56:13,SageSaga,maybe I can get Fluff to Substitute for Tom
14-09-2018T00:56:53,FluffKevlar,"what, now? or next week?"
14-09-2018T00:57:04,SageSaga,next 2 weeks
14-09-2018T00:57:33,FluffKevlar,hm i could try planning for that
14-09-2018T00:57:52,SageSaga,I'd appreciate it!
14-09-2018T00:58:07,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
14-09-2018T00:58:19,unsteddyphoenix,We would also appreciate it!
14-09-2018T00:58:21,SageSaga,if you need to work on NSFW stuff we might still be able to do it
14-09-2018T00:58:22,unsteddyphoenix,:D
14-09-2018T00:58:36,FluffKevlar,"what, pssh, i dont do NSFW stuff"
14-09-2018T00:58:48,FluffKevlar,everything is safe where we work
14-09-2018T00:59:00,FluffKevlar,i.e. at home
14-09-2018T00:59:14,ZRO4825,"He's got a pretty valid point. If your workplace don't give a flying rat's ass, everything is SFW. :P"
14-09-2018T00:59:38,ZRO4825,"Hell, I've got Nekopara as my lockscreen on my phone. My boss doesn't care. :joy:"
14-09-2018T00:59:58,SageSaga,i dont think they can have any say about your personal phone
14-09-2018T01:00:05,SageSaga,now if your work PC had something-
14-09-2018T01:00:07,ZRO4825,Oh he *could*.
14-09-2018T01:00:20,ZRO4825,"But with my boss it'd pretty much just be ""Lemme see that."" :P"
14-09-2018T01:07:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He's gonna pierce the heavens with his drill
14-09-2018T01:12:14,SageSaga,"The spell ""Nail to the Sky"" is a spell that reverses gravity on a target to the point that they reach such a height that they fall but constantly miss the planet- aka - Orbit"
14-09-2018T01:13:26,SageSaga,However- by that logic- such a spell should put him in range of his other ship if he can push further out of orbit
14-09-2018T01:13:40,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited: that is an awesome spell
14-09-2018T01:13:57,SageSaga,not very useful in a dungeon though
14-09-2018T01:14:33,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds extremely powerful
14-09-2018T01:14:53,ZRO4825,Sounds like someone made a good deal with the DM :V
14-09-2018T01:15:05,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, yeah. I can imagine using a spell that sticks your enemies to the roof with no way for them to get down would be fairly useless."
14-09-2018T01:15:35,Bgrmystr2,"and if they break through the roof, you never see them again.."
14-09-2018T01:15:41,Bgrmystr2,but who would do that?
14-09-2018T01:17:36,SageSaga,the spell eventually ends- its just physics takes over from there
14-09-2018T01:17:56,SageSaga,so if you nail them to the sky in a dungeon- they get to run around are the ceiling instead till it wears off
14-09-2018T01:19:09,Bgrmystr2,"haha I just imagine using that spell on the dungeon boss.. and it just kinda floats into the sky.... and you sit there and wait while they go up into the atmosphere and either die of asphyxiation, or the sheer temperature drop.."
14-09-2018T01:19:10,SageSaga,still - it's Tier 10 Magic
14-09-2018T01:19:32,Bgrmystr2,and like 5 mins later all your loot rains down on you
14-09-2018T01:19:53,Bgrmystr2,and/or the guy falls at terminal velocity and smacks the ground and explodes into loot anyway
14-09-2018T01:19:56,SageSaga,no- the loot would also be in orbit-
14-09-2018T01:20:12,Bgrmystr2,"ahh shit yeah cuz the loot isn't affected by the spell, is it?"
14-09-2018T01:20:25,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha rip :ptv-laugh:
14-09-2018T01:20:29,Bgrmystr2,"hey, worth it."
14-09-2018T01:20:54,Bgrmystr2,we'd still get exp
14-09-2018T01:21:01,Bgrmystr2,"unless that, too, is like the loot"
14-09-2018T01:21:09,Bgrmystr2,then oops
14-09-2018T01:22:30,SageSaga,space man comes to visit again and a skeleton of a monster slams onto the glass of his cockpit
14-09-2018T01:24:45,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
14-09-2018T01:24:57,Bgrmystr2,"""Where the hell did that come from??"""
14-09-2018T01:25:53,SageSaga,"always assume ""A wizard did it"""
14-09-2018T01:26:40,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, that's what it usually boils down to anyway."
14-09-2018T01:26:57,ZRO4825,FUN NOTE! Today marks a year since the week that drunk Kaylin was trolling Jack! =D
14-09-2018T01:26:59,unsteddyphoenix,"You mean ""a sorceror did it"""
14-09-2018T01:27:07,unsteddyphoenix,More their speed tbh
14-09-2018T01:28:33,SageSaga,not really - Sorcerers are limited in their magical works- Wizards arent
14-09-2018T01:29:26,SageSaga,you would need a very specific kinda Sorcerer to do it
14-09-2018T01:29:42,SageSaga,like a Transmutation Sorcerer or a Wild Magic Sorcerer
14-09-2018T01:30:29,SageSaga,most Sorcerers end up being Envokers though
14-09-2018T01:33:13,SageSaga,even Tim the Enchanter! He wasnt an enchanter at all! But no one dared correct him
14-09-2018T01:35:39,Dadrobit,Back. That was most excellent
14-09-2018T01:36:06,Dadrobit,I have a rather strong urge to go on a Frank Sinatra binge now though...
14-09-2018T01:46:08,SageSaga,almost done
14-09-2018T01:46:56,Dadrobit,final stretch
14-09-2018T01:47:00,ZRO4825,huzzah!
14-09-2018T01:47:07,ZRO4825,:csagesaga-bounce:
14-09-2018T01:47:37,SageSaga,oh - a bunch of the tech people got their RTX cards in today- but no drivers for them yet XD
14-09-2018T01:48:44,ZRO4825,Whoops! LOL
14-09-2018T01:49:23,SageSaga,not a mistake
14-09-2018T01:50:00,SageSaga,it's to enforce the embargo till they are ready
14-09-2018T01:53:03,SageSaga,hopefully it will be released soon because i wanna know if i should get the 2070 RTX
14-09-2018T01:53:08,unsteddyphoenix,I was mainly referring to wild magic sorcerors yeah
14-09-2018T01:53:20,unsteddyphoenix,2070? Planning ahead damn
14-09-2018T01:53:41,SageSaga,Sorcerer - why do you keep typing Sorceror?
14-09-2018T01:54:39,unsteddyphoenix,That's the uh...british spelling?
14-09-2018T01:55:00,SageSaga,dont you lie to me
14-09-2018T01:55:05,Dadrobit,Grammer is on point
14-09-2018T01:55:12,unsteddyphoenix,Sage your insight is too high
14-09-2018T01:55:41,SageSaga,"i ignored it at first assuming after i spelled it right multiple times that he would be like ""oh right that is how you spell it"""
14-09-2018T01:56:13,unsteddyphoenix,I...just typoed twice
14-09-2018T01:56:16,unsteddyphoenix,Thats all
14-09-2018T01:56:36,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes you roll two 1s in a row it happens~
14-09-2018T01:57:07,SageSaga,but then you rolled a 1 on your bluff
14-09-2018T01:57:11,Dadrobit,""":KeirenFacepalm:"" -Serp probably"
14-09-2018T01:57:32,unsteddyphoenix,I know right
14-09-2018T01:57:39,unsteddyphoenix,Even with my maxxed out charisma :ctwokinds-wink:
14-09-2018T01:57:50,SageSaga,another 1
14-09-2018T01:57:57,unsteddyphoenix,Stop that
14-09-2018T01:58:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm: for serp
14-09-2018T01:58:03,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
14-09-2018T01:58:25,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
14-09-2018T01:58:42,Dadrobit,Kat is a terrible example of charisma tbh.
14-09-2018T01:58:52,unsteddyphoenix,I...
14-09-2018T01:59:05,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats a little true
14-09-2018T01:59:23,Dadrobit,"Not even trolling. Who calls another girl ""tubby"" in the middle of a massage."
14-09-2018T01:59:31,Dadrobit,?
14-09-2018T01:59:43,unsteddyphoenix,Shes clearly just establishing dominance
14-09-2018T01:59:49,unsteddyphoenix,Or whatever
14-09-2018T01:59:50,ZRO4825,lol
14-09-2018T02:00:11,Dadrobit,"Establishes dominance, then immediately runs away."
14-09-2018T02:00:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Wasnt there like a thing about. ""well fed"" keidran being attractive in keidran society?"
14-09-2018T02:00:34,Dadrobit,Not in the comic at least.
14-09-2018T02:00:46,Twokinds,Yes
14-09-2018T02:00:55,Twokinds,Flora mentijms
14-09-2018T02:01:12,Dadrobit,Really?
14-09-2018T02:01:50,SageSaga,all done
14-09-2018T02:01:54,ZRO4825,Huzzah!
14-09-2018T02:01:54,Dadrobit,"Page 350, yep"
14-09-2018T02:01:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well doen Sage
14-09-2018T02:02:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,doen? Done
14-09-2018T02:02:08,JamesBSquirrel3,Yeah Sage!
14-09-2018T02:02:19,Dadrobit,Congrats Sage
14-09-2018T02:02:37,ZRO4825,"Wait, are you allowed to be done this early, Sage?"
14-09-2018T02:02:43,SageSaga,Yes
14-09-2018T02:02:47,ZRO4825,It's still almost a full 12 hours before your stream tomorrow...
14-09-2018T02:02:49,SageSaga,No one else got back to me
14-09-2018T02:02:57,Bgrmystr2,"nicely done sage, page looks nice"
14-09-2018T02:03:06,CrimsonQuill,I've just got up. WHat's going on?
14-09-2018T02:03:13,ZRO4825,"Also, loved the pages this week for Yosh! &lt;3 lol"
14-09-2018T02:03:13,Bgrmystr2,that 4th panel is particularly nice
14-09-2018T02:03:17,SageSaga,2 Color pictures arent due till Next Month
14-09-2018T02:03:19,unsteddyphoenix,People just dont want the art they paid for a I guess
14-09-2018T02:03:22,CrimsonQuill,It's 8:02 am here.
14-09-2018T02:03:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah nice perspective
14-09-2018T02:03:33,CrimsonQuill,What's happening?
14-09-2018T02:03:35,SageSaga,and 4 people for sketches havent said anything-
14-09-2018T02:03:40,SageSaga,and one Color person hasnt
14-09-2018T02:03:46,SageSaga,stream is ending Crimson
14-09-2018T02:03:47,ZRO4825,"FFS, lol"
14-09-2018T02:03:48,unsteddyphoenix,What a waste
14-09-2018T02:03:49,JamesBSquirrel3,So now you can get some rest. Maybe on Sunday?
14-09-2018T02:03:58,CrimsonQuill,Oh. I arrive right as it ends.
14-09-2018T02:04:04,CrimsonQuill,Blasted time zones.
14-09-2018T02:04:08,SageSaga,12 hours from now will be the color stream
14-09-2018T02:04:11,Dadrobit,I know that feel.
14-09-2018T02:04:18,Twokinds,less work!
14-09-2018T02:04:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\[T]/ Toyoko

14-09-2018T02:04:53,CrimsonQuill,Good morning and goodbye!
14-09-2018T02:05:17,JamesBSquirrel3,Sweet dreams Sage!:ptv-hearts:
14-09-2018T02:05:18,Dadrobit,o/
14-09-2018T02:05:22,SageSaga,(Do you think anyone noticed that i was streaming at a higher resolution today?)
14-09-2018T02:05:31,unsteddyphoenix,I literally have two sessions of dnd tomorrow
14-09-2018T02:05:44,unsteddyphoenix,I never notice that stuff until it's pointed out~
14-09-2018T02:05:45,SageSaga,have fun! I run one
14-09-2018T02:05:49,unsteddyphoenix,Then I cant un-see it
14-09-2018T02:05:51,Bgrmystr2,I actually hadn't noticed
14-09-2018T02:05:53,Dadrobit,good luck
14-09-2018T02:05:59,Bgrmystr2,but I would have if it was when you were drawing Yuugi
14-09-2018T02:06:17,SageSaga,wat
14-09-2018T02:06:44,Bgrmystr2,"like, last week"
14-09-2018T02:06:50,SageSaga,you fullscreened that?
14-09-2018T02:06:59,Bgrmystr2,yeah several times
14-09-2018T02:07:28,Bgrmystr2,"I full screen lots of stuff, sometimes you, sometimes tom, sometimes ron, depending on what's being drawn :u"
14-09-2018T02:07:50,SageSaga,well i could notice it a lot because my monitor is a 2k monitor- and 720p blown up to nearly 2k is very obvious
14-09-2018T02:07:54,SageSaga,1080 not as much
14-09-2018T02:08:06,unsteddyphoenix,oh nice
14-09-2018T02:08:08,unsteddyphoenix,brag about it
14-09-2018T02:08:12,Bgrmystr2,yah.. I run 1080p so
14-09-2018T02:08:39,Dadrobit,1440
14-09-2018T02:09:11,ZRO4825,I cry in 1080p
14-09-2018T02:10:12,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like 1080's still good...
14-09-2018T02:10:18,unsteddyphoenix,r...right?
14-09-2018T02:10:27,Dadrobit,"yeah, honestly it is"
14-09-2018T02:10:29,ZRO4825,Actually it seems to work perfectly fine for me.
14-09-2018T02:10:47,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
14-09-2018T02:11:09,SageSaga,yeah 1080 is still good
14-09-2018T02:13:09,Dadrobit,What's not good is this stupid fucking dogfight mini-game in FFXV. I swear to god it's rigged...
14-09-2018T02:13:25,Twokinds,No it's garbage now. The future is 16k!
14-09-2018T02:13:55,unsteddyphoenix,Nooo~
14-09-2018T02:14:00,Twokinds,FFXV eh? how is that?
14-09-2018T02:14:05,unsteddyphoenix,Must...upgrade...to stay....relevant!
14-09-2018T02:14:13,SageSaga,you need like 4 meters of monitor to get 16k
14-09-2018T02:14:21,Dadrobit,It's..... Okay. At best.
14-09-2018T02:14:50,SageSaga,i played it
14-09-2018T02:14:56,SageSaga,it was garbage
14-09-2018T02:15:10,Dadrobit,"Fighting consists of holding Circle to attack, and pressing Square to defend/dodge. It's super dissapointing."
14-09-2018T02:15:14,unsteddyphoenix,Ah going' out to eat. 'Night everyone~
14-09-2018T02:15:19,Dadrobit,disappointing*
14-09-2018T02:15:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Quickly, is that the boyband one?"
14-09-2018T02:15:32,Dadrobit,o/ Unsteddy
14-09-2018T02:15:35,unsteddyphoenix,I heard the boyband one is good
14-09-2018T02:15:40,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's the boyband one."
14-09-2018T02:15:41,SageSaga,(I actually havent played it and i dont actually think it is garbage_
14-09-2018T02:15:49,unsteddyphoenix,"hm ok,"
14-09-2018T02:15:51,unsteddyphoenix,seeya!
14-09-2018T02:16:30,Dadrobit,"It's very pretty to watch, and I like the characters and story well enough, but the gameplay is very pretty lacking."
14-09-2018T02:16:56,ZRO4825,I actually was quite enjoying it till I got stuck in sidequest hell.
14-09-2018T02:17:06,SageSaga,arent all the characters just like figure heads to revolve around the main character?
14-09-2018T02:17:25,Dadrobit,They're his support staff.
14-09-2018T02:17:54,Dadrobit,"His body guard, his cook/retainer, and his school buddy."
14-09-2018T02:18:29,SageSaga,at least hes not a liar like Tidus
14-09-2018T02:19:08,Dadrobit,Haven't played X in forever
14-09-2018T02:19:22,SageSaga,FFX starts with Tidus lying
14-09-2018T02:19:33,SageSaga,i think it's the legit first line of the game
14-09-2018T02:19:51,Dadrobit,I thought it started in the water polo match?
14-09-2018T02:20:13,Dadrobit,"""HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA"""
14-09-2018T02:20:20,SageSaga,no it starts with them half way through their journey and then goes into the past
14-09-2018T02:20:26,Dadrobit,S'pretty much all I remember
14-09-2018T02:20:42,SageSaga,"it starts with ""This is MY story"" speech"
14-09-2018T02:21:02,SageSaga,and it is not his story- he doesnt matter at all- it's Yuna's story
14-09-2018T02:21:35,Dadrobit,"Like how XII wasn't about Vaan or Penelo, it was Balthier's story all along!"
14-09-2018T02:23:13,Dadrobit,(I honestly really liked XII. It's combat system was dope as all get out)
14-09-2018T02:23:18,Dadrobit,Its*
14-09-2018T02:23:39,SageSaga,i never got to play it- Brother Sold my Playstation then
14-09-2018T02:23:46,Dadrobit,Dag
14-09-2018T02:23:49,Dadrobit,Dang*
14-09-2018T02:24:07,SageSaga,its coming out on switch but it looks ugly- not sure if i could deal with that
14-09-2018T02:24:16,Dadrobit,"They have the remastered version that just came out last year on PS4 though, so you can get it there."
14-09-2018T02:24:30,Twokinds,I noticed it looked pretty bad
14-09-2018T02:24:37,Dadrobit,And they even have Vaan's abs right side out now!
14-09-2018T02:24:42,SageSaga,almost all the Switch ports looked terrible
14-09-2018T02:25:08,Twokinds,No real helping that
14-09-2018T02:25:45,SageSaga,the switch hardware is good though- they can do a lot with it
14-09-2018T02:25:56,ZRO4825,I wanna get a switch so I can play MHGU ;_;
14-09-2018T02:26:13,SageSaga,it's fun - i wont be able to play through it all without people though
14-09-2018T02:26:45,Dadrobit,"Oh man, just watched the trailer. Did they really use footage with frame stutter for an official announcement? Ooof"
14-09-2018T02:30:58,Dadrobit,"Hm, I think when I'm done w/ XV, I'm gonna go back and cleanse my palette with XII again."
14-09-2018T03:17:49,Dadrobit,:/ Mandatory restart in 15 minutes.... GG Windows
14-09-2018T03:23:44,Twokinds,Least it warned you!
14-09-2018T03:25:58,unsteddyphoenix,Rest in peace dad you will be remembered
14-09-2018T03:31:36,DarthRexKing,Goodnight!
14-09-2018T03:33:33,Dadrobit,Ended up just doing it manually.
14-09-2018T03:33:38,Dadrobit,Just to spite it.
14-09-2018T03:34:02,unsteddyphoenix,I'm so proud of you
14-09-2018T03:45:52,Twokinds,I'm gunna fall unconscious for about 8 hours brb
14-09-2018T03:46:05,Dadrobit,"Have a good one, Tom."
14-09-2018T03:46:07,Bgrmystr2,have a good sleep tom :ptv-greetings:
14-09-2018T03:55:44,unsteddyphoenix,o/
14-09-2018T04:20:03,Dadrobit,God this game is actually the worst. 0/10
14-09-2018T04:21:14,Dadrobit,"I hate betting mini-games, and I hate especially when games lock content behind them."
14-09-2018T04:23:25,Dadrobit,"Been playing this stupid dogfight minigame for around 4 hours, only at about 1/3 the required amount of winnings."
14-09-2018T06:37:38,Xexanoth,now i have flashbacks to paazak from kotor...fuck that game.
14-09-2018T07:19:07,Dadrobit,"It's a betting game on a monster arena, but it's very rigged. Every 2-3 games, the game sabotages the monsters you bet on by making their AI go super passive while the others go full Mike Tyson and gang up on your bet, it's ludicrous."
14-09-2018T07:19:54,Dadrobit,"Can only bet a max of 9999 arena medals at a time, I need 3.6 million to buy what I need."
14-09-2018T10:49:24,Nekonny,o/
14-09-2018T10:50:07,Dakina,Yo
14-09-2018T10:50:17,Pimsan,Hiya! How is everyone doing?
14-09-2018T10:50:37,Mislakane,hello
14-09-2018T10:56:32,Nekonny,heya guys
14-09-2018T10:56:34,Nekonny,doing good
14-09-2018T10:57:41,Pimsan,Good to hear!
14-09-2018T10:58:35,Nekonny,testing something out in emofuri
14-09-2018T11:01:25,Pimsan,How?
14-09-2018T11:02:04,Ngrasta,Hiya folks ♥
14-09-2018T11:02:28,Nekonny,I wanted to see about adding alternate arm sets to the basic template
14-09-2018T11:02:40,Nekonny,hey there ngrasta
14-09-2018T11:06:15,Pimsan,Cool.
14-09-2018T11:06:22,sunblaze,hiya
14-09-2018T11:06:32,Nekonny,heya sun
14-09-2018T11:06:55,Nekonny,I'm not sure why Ive been on such a emofuri binge lately
14-09-2018T11:07:20,Supersun,:ptv-greetings:
14-09-2018T11:07:51,sunblaze,^love the name :D
14-09-2018T11:08:25,Supersun,:ptv-hearts:
14-09-2018T11:10:25,Nekonny,"welp... cant reach the confirm/cancel button on the bottom of the window ^_^"""
14-09-2018T11:10:43,Mislakane,oops
14-09-2018T11:20:09,Chalodraws,morning
14-09-2018T11:20:09,Nekonny,"sorry, still leaning some features ^^""trial and error"
14-09-2018T11:20:14,Nekonny,heya chalo!
14-09-2018T11:20:26,Pimsan,Hiya Chalo! How are you?
14-09-2018T11:20:43,Dadrobit,o/ Ron
14-09-2018T11:21:55,Mislakane,a chalo appears
14-09-2018T11:23:08,Nekonny,heya dadro
14-09-2018T11:27:40,Nekonny,"Well, looks like it works!"
14-09-2018T11:28:11,Nekonny,"it adds an extra layer of complexity, but it is a lot more expressive when you can have multiple hands"
14-09-2018T11:30:00,Nekonny,with this I can have up to 3 more hand sets...
14-09-2018T11:30:56,Nekonny,"alternatively, I could have a total of 5 arms... and that would allow combinations...."
14-09-2018T11:31:00,Nekonny,hum....
14-09-2018T11:31:25,Nekonny,but wouldnt allow interactivity between them
14-09-2018T11:31:43,Nekonny,what gives me the most options...
14-09-2018T11:32:53,Chalodraws,:cchalodraws-SarahFace2C:
14-09-2018T11:33:18,Nekonny,XD
14-09-2018T11:33:23,Nekonny,wheres my sarah?
14-09-2018T11:34:49,Pimsan,"No that i think about it. Did you every draw one of Chalo's character, Nekonny?"
14-09-2018T11:34:58,Nekonny,oh yes
14-09-2018T11:35:04,Nekonny,lots of times XD
14-09-2018T11:35:08,Pimsan,I see.
14-09-2018T11:35:42,Nekonny,you can see them on my DA gallery
14-09-2018T11:36:07,Nekonny,"Well, the math shos that with only 5 variatios, the most I could get would be 6 arm types"
14-09-2018T11:36:43,Nekonny,which isn't worth sacrificing the interaction IMO
14-09-2018T11:37:02,Chalodraws,i been super busy...
14-09-2018T11:37:07,Nekonny,NP ^^
14-09-2018T11:37:26,Nekonny,"theres reslly n o rush, I'm just messing with you"
14-09-2018T11:39:50,Nekonny,Although... seperating L and R would allow me to make special deformations
14-09-2018T11:39:54,Nekonny,that might be worth it
14-09-2018T11:41:25,Nekonny,This is a good learning step for anything else that I make
14-09-2018T11:41:50,Nekonny,My concern is that Live2d might be the better platform for me t o lern
14-09-2018T11:42:20,Nekonny,"its a lot more complex though, not that I couldnt understand it, but because the projects would take so much loonger to create"
14-09-2018T11:42:58,Mislakane,:thinking:
14-09-2018T11:50:17,Nekonny,"Guys, chat is going to reform over at https://picarto.tv/Nekonny"
14-09-2018T11:50:36,Nekonny,"If you want to continue in it, just go to that one"
14-09-2018T11:50:39,Chalodraws,is that still needed?

14-09-2018T14:07:42,CrimsonQuill,Sketch stream?
14-09-2018T14:08:01,sunblaze,scetch? looks more like a regular comic page. why scetch?
14-09-2018T14:08:17,CrimsonQuill,Just what I call all the streams.
14-09-2018T14:08:20,CrimsonQuill,By default.
14-09-2018T14:08:29,sunblaze,ah ok :D
14-09-2018T14:08:40,SageSaga,hey Sunblaze- do you have your request?
14-09-2018T14:09:17,Mippy,It is literally summer and it is snowing again
14-09-2018T14:09:18,sunblaze,yep give me a minute searching somethign else right now
14-09-2018T14:09:23,sunblaze,come back to you in 5
14-09-2018T14:10:00,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga I'm slowly making my way through Yosh. I really like it.
14-09-2018T14:10:55,SageSaga,Glad ya enjoy it ^^
14-09-2018T14:11:10,CrimsonQuill,I'm only in 2007 though.
14-09-2018T14:11:16,SageSaga,yikes
14-09-2018T14:11:20,CrimsonQuill,I'm savouring it about two months per day.
14-09-2018T14:11:29,Mippy,"Same Crimson, except I’m still in the part where it makes no sense XD"
14-09-2018T14:11:33,sunblaze,don't worry the end is near :D
14-09-2018T14:11:58,CrimsonQuill,Punctuated by occasional spurts of seven to eight.
14-09-2018T14:12:18,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, is Yosh approaching it's end? As in, end end?"
14-09-2018T14:12:26,SageSaga,ha
14-09-2018T14:12:50,CrimsonQuill,I'm only just discovering all of these webcomics! There are so many to read!
14-09-2018T14:13:36,SageSaga,did you read AI yet?
14-09-2018T14:13:52,sunblaze,that and there are new ones every time you look again :D sadly as many vanish or are discoontinued :(
14-09-2018T14:14:01,CrimsonQuill,"I read the tart a bit ago, but then University exams happende."
14-09-2018T14:14:10,CrimsonQuill,happened
14-09-2018T14:15:49,Mippy,I wants to know Sage’s stuff a bit better so gotta take some time to sit and binge AI and Yosh. But all I get are a half hour hear and there. Oh the life of a student
14-09-2018T14:17:00,CrimsonQuill,"I'm following three webcomics at the moment-Yosh, Twokinds and Hunters of Salamanstra."
14-09-2018T14:17:09,CrimsonQuill,And more are on my list.
14-09-2018T14:17:20,sunblaze,oh sorry forget to mention that. yes a bathing suit. if bikini or a 1-piece I leave to you
14-09-2018T14:17:22,SageSaga,AI is much better written and more compact- Yosh! is an extended very long series of events
14-09-2018T14:17:52,CrimsonQuill,Ok
14-09-2018T14:17:58,sunblaze,glorious picarto and its stupid public pm's :P
14-09-2018T14:18:12,Mippy,I have been fallowing Twokinds since I was in high school. I’m just getting into other web comics so I gotta find some stuff to fallow.
14-09-2018T14:18:28,SageSaga,I've been doing Yosh since Twokinds XD
14-09-2018T14:18:44,SageSaga,That's how Tom and I met
14-09-2018T14:18:45,CrimsonQuill,I discovered Twokinds in December
14-09-2018T14:19:08,Mippy,"Yeah, I noticed you and Tom started aroun the same time when I started reading Yosh."
14-09-2018T14:19:10,SageSaga,Yosh Started almost 15 years ago
14-09-2018T14:20:21,Mippy,I’ve been out of high school for around 11 years. So I’ve been fallowing Tom for a while
14-09-2018T14:20:23,Mihari,I've read it 7 times T_T
14-09-2018T14:20:57,Mihari,Everytime something goes wrong with the Katbox I legit fear anything involving Sage's site.
14-09-2018T14:21:28,Mippy,"Well, gotta catch a bus. If your still streaming when I get home Sage I may pop back in. Bye"
14-09-2018T14:21:35,SageSaga,take care Mippy
14-09-2018T14:22:46,SageSaga,"I dont know how to feel about Mihari using ""T_T"" after saying she's read it 7 times ^_^"
14-09-2018T14:23:24,Mihari,How would you feel reading your comic that many times? XD
14-09-2018T14:23:38,SageSaga,well I have
14-09-2018T14:23:47,Mihari,That doesn't answer the question :P
14-09-2018T14:23:56,FoxxTrotter,He has it on replay. ;0P
14-09-2018T14:24:07,SageSaga,I like my comic  - the beginning is rough but overall i enjoy it
14-09-2018T14:25:26,Mihari,"I enjoy after a certain point, but yah, a lot of rough at the start."
14-09-2018T14:25:47,CrimsonQuill,I'll be off for a bit
14-09-2018T14:25:56,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to fly spaceships.
14-09-2018T14:26:00,SageSaga,take care Crimson
14-09-2018T14:26:05,CrimsonQuill,Hopefully I'll be back soon.
14-09-2018T14:26:14,CrimsonQuill,Cheerio for now
14-09-2018T14:28:25,SageSaga,"I also get how frustrating working on my site can be- its like ""Ok this will automatically load all the comics and- it stopped at 200... crap, this is going to take a while"""
14-09-2018T14:30:05,SageSaga,an archive of over 2000 pages is a lot to deal with
14-09-2018T14:33:16,SageSaga,The worse part was going through 2000 pages and manually fixing the comic pages to the comic site- and then you found out an automated way to do it that would have worked
14-09-2018T14:44:52,Twokinds,Morning!
14-09-2018T14:44:58,SageSaga,yo Tom!
14-09-2018T14:51:46,SageSaga,Ya got something to work on Tom?
14-09-2018T14:55:21,Twokinds,Not at the moment no
14-09-2018T14:57:36,Rosscoe,Hello everyone!
14-09-2018T14:58:04,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: oo what a night
14-09-2018T14:58:08,SageSaga,yo
14-09-2018T14:58:09,Bgrmystr2,slept like a rock
14-09-2018T14:58:14,Bgrmystr2,mornin sage
14-09-2018T15:01:40,SageSaga,I had a dream that Tom took over my work on AI and it got super popular and i was really happy and really sad at the same time
14-09-2018T15:02:48,Rosscoe,"Bgrmystr im jealious, I been waken up to noise and more noise"
14-09-2018T15:02:50,Rosscoe,and umdiity
14-09-2018T15:02:55,Rosscoe,humidity*
14-09-2018T15:03:03,Rosscoe,"4 hours sleep, still got 3 more back shifts"
14-09-2018T15:06:51,Bgrmystr2,lol well ross it helps if you can sleep through like.. I dunno.. a truck crashing into your room or something
14-09-2018T15:09:15,SageSaga,that doesnt sound like it would be a helpful level of sleeping through things
14-09-2018T15:09:22,Bgrmystr2,also.. yeah sage I can see that dream
14-09-2018T15:09:36,Bgrmystr2,"nope, sleeping through most stuff isn't really helpful"
14-09-2018T15:09:41,Bgrmystr2,makes me late a lot
14-09-2018T15:10:02,Bgrmystr2,..a whole fucking lot :ptv-sad:
14-09-2018T15:11:19,Bgrmystr2,"my phone has three alarms loud enough to hear through the whole house, and I still end up turning them off mid-sleep and waking up 10-30 mins after they've all already gone off."
14-09-2018T15:11:43,SageSaga,set them to the sonic drowning warning
14-09-2018T15:11:45,Rosscoe,I've only been late for hitting the disamr alarm button and not hte snooze for 5 more minutes
14-09-2018T15:11:49,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.. but.. yknow"
14-09-2018T15:11:54,Bgrmystr2,"I'd sleep through it, sage xD"
14-09-2018T15:12:05,Rosscoe,"Only time I get a good sleep is if I been up for over 24 hours,"
14-09-2018T15:13:02,SageSaga,you need to find a set of sounds that wake you up- and make sure you switch between them so you dont get used to it
14-09-2018T15:13:11,Rosscoe,Least its noise roomie today fora move out then Sunday where Im going to need the serious z's for Mondays double 16 hour shift
14-09-2018T15:13:33,SageSaga,i set the alarm on my Tablet pc for the battery dying to the Sonic drowning theme - never reached for a cord faster
14-09-2018T15:13:35,Rosscoe,"sorry double 8, making 16 hous"
14-09-2018T15:13:49,Bgrmystr2,"my phone doesn't have enough space for that, unfortunately"
14-09-2018T15:13:58,SageSaga,make room
14-09-2018T15:14:07,SageSaga,delete some porn
14-09-2018T15:14:11,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. I could.. but still
14-09-2018T15:14:13,Bgrmystr2,it's not that big
14-09-2018T15:14:56,Bgrmystr2,I only have.. 70mb total in the phone.. not including the space taken up from the phone itself
14-09-2018T15:15:01,Bgrmystr2,and messages
14-09-2018T15:15:43,SageSaga,wth kinda garbage phone do you have?
14-09-2018T15:16:04,Bgrmystr2,"it's not garbage, just old. It's not made for space."
14-09-2018T15:16:09,Bgrmystr2,It's made for survival
14-09-2018T15:16:22,SageSaga,if it's old then it probably actually has an SSD slot
14-09-2018T15:16:28,SageSaga,not SSD
14-09-2018T15:16:32,SageSaga,MicroSD
14-09-2018T15:16:34,Bgrmystr2,it's not a smartphone lol
14-09-2018T15:16:50,Bgrmystr2,there is no MicroSD slot
14-09-2018T15:16:51,SageSaga,what is your point? My old flip phone has a micro sd slot
14-09-2018T15:16:53,Bgrmystr2,not even inside it
14-09-2018T15:17:02,SageSaga,boy
14-09-2018T15:17:05,SageSaga,get a new phone
14-09-2018T15:17:10,Bgrmystr2,that costs money
14-09-2018T15:17:12,Bgrmystr2,:C
14-09-2018T15:17:19,SageSaga,then buy an alarm clock
14-09-2018T15:17:25,Bgrmystr2,.. I have one
14-09-2018T15:17:33,Bgrmystr2,one of those super loud ringer ones
14-09-2018T15:17:47,SageSaga,get one of those vibrating pad alarm clocks
14-09-2018T15:17:57,Bgrmystr2,the reason I use my phone is cuz the alarm clock didn't work xD
14-09-2018T15:18:26,Bgrmystr2,"also, I dunno what that is"
14-09-2018T15:19:39,SageSaga,https://smile.amazon.com/iLuv-Smartshaker-Portable-Vibrating-Sleepers/dp/B01EHEIGOG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1537042747&sr=8-1&keywords=alarms+for+the+deaf
14-09-2018T15:20:17,Bgrmystr2,ahh okay the one I found was like $80
14-09-2018T15:20:29,Rosscoe,"Bgrmystr is the priem example of ""Heavy Sleeper"""
14-09-2018T15:20:35,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. my luck I'll end up sleeping my head on that itself xD
14-09-2018T15:20:43,Bgrmystr2,or it'll fall behind my bed
14-09-2018T15:21:58,CrimsonQuill,Hullo-I'm back
14-09-2018T15:22:04,Bgrmystr2,wb
14-09-2018T15:22:09,SageSaga,wb
14-09-2018T15:22:16,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
14-09-2018T15:22:41,SageSaga,Bgr- put it inside your pillow
14-09-2018T15:22:45,CrimsonQuill,"Now that I'm here, have any of you hard of Nanbaka?"
14-09-2018T15:23:02,SageSaga,yep
14-09-2018T15:23:07,Rosscoe,Nope
14-09-2018T15:23:08,SageSaga,never watched it though
14-09-2018T15:23:24,CrimsonQuill,"My sister, who's a big anime fan-bigger than me-urged me to watch it."
14-09-2018T15:23:35,CrimsonQuill,IT'S INCREDIBLY GOOD.
14-09-2018T15:23:42,CrimsonQuill,I'm still watching.
14-09-2018T15:23:53,CrimsonQuill,Then I have a host of otheres to take care of.
14-09-2018T15:24:28,Bgrmystr2,it's from 2016 so not surprising I haven't heard of it
14-09-2018T15:24:38,Bgrmystr2,I'm still catching up on series from 2015 and earlier
14-09-2018T15:24:59,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I have a host of these things I need to watch."
14-09-2018T15:25:04,Bgrmystr2,yeah same
14-09-2018T15:25:08,Bgrmystr2,I have hundreds of titles
14-09-2018T15:25:16,Bgrmystr2,several hundred..
14-09-2018T15:25:26,CrimsonQuill,My list is still quite small-only about 10 or so.
14-09-2018T15:26:05,Bgrmystr2,I stopped watching the currently airing list back in.. I dunno.. '13 or so? :ptv-wondering:
14-09-2018T15:26:15,Bgrmystr2,maybe '12?
14-09-2018T15:26:20,Bgrmystr2,it's been a while..
14-09-2018T15:27:04,CrimsonQuill,I startes my Anime cruise with a really old one-Inuyasha.
14-09-2018T15:27:48,SageSaga,Inuyasha is considered Old now?
14-09-2018T15:28:23,CrimsonQuill,By some...
14-09-2018T15:28:26,MatyMaty,Well Sage. it came out in 2000
14-09-2018T15:28:36,CrimsonQuill,I liked it but there was a lot of padding.
14-09-2018T15:28:46,MatyMaty,there is young people today who were born after the series started
14-09-2018T15:28:46,SageSaga,thats not even 20 years ago!
14-09-2018T15:28:49,CrimsonQuill,I skipped Yugioh.
14-09-2018T15:28:56,CrimsonQuill,I read the manga for that instead.
14-09-2018T15:29:05,Rosscoe,its only been 18 years
14-09-2018T15:29:09,CrimsonQuill,One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100 really set me off.
14-09-2018T15:29:19,Rosscoe,I guess anything is classed as old is over 10 now
14-09-2018T15:29:24,CrimsonQuill,I did really like Inuyasha's running gags though....
14-09-2018T15:29:24,Rosscoe,it'll be vintage in 2 more years!
14-09-2018T15:29:29,CrimsonQuill,'OSUWARI!'
14-09-2018T15:29:29,MatyMaty,Think about it this way Sage XD
14-09-2018T15:29:38,MatyMaty,"in 2008, how distant 1990 felt?"
14-09-2018T15:29:44,Bgrmystr2,yeah I was gonna say
14-09-2018T15:29:48,SageSaga,like a skip away
14-09-2018T15:29:58,Bgrmystr2,How do ppl feel about the classic 90s and 80s anime
14-09-2018T15:29:59,CrimsonQuill,We live in a weird time.
14-09-2018T15:30:09,Rosscoe,80's anime has some good titles and story telling
14-09-2018T15:30:21,Rosscoe,and creative art works
14-09-2018T15:30:21,SageSaga,ya'll need some 3x3 Eyes
14-09-2018T15:30:22,CrimsonQuill,"Where the new is whatever came out 10 seconds ago, and the old is only a minute"
14-09-2018T15:30:27,Rosscoe,3x3 eyes
14-09-2018T15:30:32,Rosscoe,I watched that one
14-09-2018T15:30:36,Bgrmystr2,there's a surprising amount of good stories in the pre-2000s
14-09-2018T15:30:47,CrimsonQuill,One of my favourite films of all time is a 90s anime film
14-09-2018T15:30:51,CrimsonQuill,Guess which one
14-09-2018T15:30:59,Rosscoe,"I found a tin box copy of IRA never opened few years ago, was a fun adventure"
14-09-2018T15:31:05,Bgrmystr2,gonna go on a limb and say Akira
14-09-2018T15:31:05,MatyMaty,"Heck, the Haruhi franchise"
14-09-2018T15:31:13,MatyMaty,is considered ancient history now
14-09-2018T15:31:14,CrimsonQuill,Nope. Both wrong
14-09-2018T15:31:21,CrimsonQuill,'Mononoke Hime'
14-09-2018T15:31:27,SageSaga,Akira is older than 90s
14-09-2018T15:31:29,Bgrmystr2,"I'm the only one that guessed, Quill lol"
14-09-2018T15:31:32,CrimsonQuill,Also known as 'Princess Mononoke
14-09-2018T15:31:36,CrimsonQuill,LOL
14-09-2018T15:31:42,Bgrmystr2,ah is it? I don't recall xD
14-09-2018T15:31:48,Bgrmystr2,"I watched Akira once, didn't really get into it"
14-09-2018T15:31:51,Rosscoe,Akria......There was a Akira paraody in a France Cartoon I just watched
14-09-2018T15:31:53,Bgrmystr2,and that was about the end of it
14-09-2018T15:31:53,SageSaga,Akira was late 80s
14-09-2018T15:32:02,Bgrmystr2,ehh close enough :U
14-09-2018T15:32:07,MatyMaty,Even Carameldansen
14-09-2018T15:32:12,MatyMaty,is like prehistoric now :v
14-09-2018T15:32:13,Bgrmystr2,lol Maty
14-09-2018T15:32:17,CrimsonQuill,Princess Mononoke for me is a masterpiece.
14-09-2018T15:32:22,Bgrmystr2,I still like that
14-09-2018T15:32:24,CrimsonQuill,"The story, the visuals, the music!"
14-09-2018T15:32:28,CrimsonQuill,THE MUSIC!
14-09-2018T15:32:28,SageSaga,Carameldansen isnt an anime
14-09-2018T15:32:31,Bgrmystr2,my friend from sweden hates it XD
14-09-2018T15:32:33,CrimsonQuill,Whut
14-09-2018T15:32:39,CrimsonQuill,I've lost the thread
14-09-2018T15:32:52,MatyMaty,I know :P
14-09-2018T15:32:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah it wasn't even originally from an anime even through the meme
14-09-2018T15:33:02,Bgrmystr2,it was from a game opening
14-09-2018T15:33:06,CrimsonQuill,ok
14-09-2018T15:33:26,Bgrmystr2,though there was an anime made :thinking:
14-09-2018T15:33:34,Rosscoe,"uuugh, you know I ponder the power of people's reading abilites lately, I got a ad up online saying ""Make me an offer  I can not refuse"" on an item I have and I keep getting asked ""Whats your lowest?"""
14-09-2018T15:33:39,SageSaga,the anime was Popotan
14-09-2018T15:33:45,SageSaga,and it made very little sense
14-09-2018T15:33:57,Rosscoe,My sister has the complete series of Poptan
14-09-2018T15:33:58,SageSaga,but i watched it before the meme
14-09-2018T15:34:02,Rosscoe,I watched the first 5 epsiodes
14-09-2018T15:34:12,CrimsonQuill,I bought Princess Mononoke on Blu Ray a few days ago.
14-09-2018T15:34:18,Bgrmystr2,lol I don't have the series physically yet
14-09-2018T15:34:23,Bgrmystr2,I wanna get it though
14-09-2018T15:34:25,CrimsonQuill,And have two volumes of Assassination Classroom manga
14-09-2018T15:34:33,Rosscoe,"then was like ""Sooo its just a show with fan service and some bizzare time travel world hopping power house"""
14-09-2018T15:35:05,Bgrmystr2,well.. it was based off an eroge
14-09-2018T15:35:08,Bgrmystr2,VN
14-09-2018T15:35:10,Bgrmystr2,so..?
14-09-2018T15:35:26,Bgrmystr2,not sure what you entirely expected from back then xD
14-09-2018T15:35:35,CrimsonQuill,MARMITW
14-09-2018T15:35:37,CrimsonQuill,MARMITE
14-09-2018T15:35:45,Rosscoe,Whelp time too go cook some chicken and chips
14-09-2018T15:35:52,CrimsonQuill,MARMITE
14-09-2018T15:36:01,Rosscoe,Watching Tom Saka cartoons again?
14-09-2018T15:36:07,Bgrmystr2,"popotan was cute, both game and anime. I liked the art and music"
14-09-2018T15:36:18,CrimsonQuill,"No, I genuinely love marmite."
14-09-2018T15:36:29,MatyMaty,I know the big thing nowadays is Fortnite. But what game was popular in the early 2000's? :thinking:
14-09-2018T15:36:42,CrimsonQuill,Killzone?
14-09-2018T15:36:57,Bgrmystr2,"for xbox, Halo :v"
14-09-2018T15:37:00,Rosscoe,Star Craft
14-09-2018T15:37:01,CrimsonQuill,HALO!
14-09-2018T15:37:10,SageSaga,Oblivion?
14-09-2018T15:37:11,CrimsonQuill,HOW DIDN'T I GUESS THAT?
14-09-2018T15:37:22,CrimsonQuill,I guess the silliest things
14-09-2018T15:37:29,MatyMaty,oh yes Oblivion :o
14-09-2018T15:37:35,CrimsonQuill,Elder Scrolls?
14-09-2018T15:37:36,Bgrmystr2,early 2000s.. Motherfuckin Diablo 2
14-09-2018T15:37:56,CrimsonQuill,My first game to see Daddy play was Call of Duty MW
14-09-2018T15:38:07,CrimsonQuill,And Medal of Honour Airborne
14-09-2018T15:38:19,SageSaga,Team Fortress 2
14-09-2018T15:38:47,SageSaga,Oh- Neverwinter Nights
14-09-2018T15:38:52,MatyMaty,Minecraft?
14-09-2018T15:39:00,CrimsonQuill,'And from that day forward any time a bunch of animals are together in one place it's called a zoo!'
14-09-2018T15:39:10,CrimsonQuill,'Unless it's a farm!'
14-09-2018T15:39:18,SageSaga,minecraft was near the end of the 2000s right?
14-09-2018T15:39:22,CrimsonQuill,I think so
14-09-2018T15:39:34,Rosscoe,Hang on
14-09-2018T15:39:37,Rosscoe,google will answer this!
14-09-2018T15:39:37,MatyMaty,"I have never played it, so I dunno XD"
14-09-2018T15:39:42,Bgrmystr2,"2009 I think, Sage"
14-09-2018T15:39:45,Bgrmystr2,around there
14-09-2018T15:39:46,MatyMaty,I had a little creeper figure though
14-09-2018T15:39:47,Bgrmystr2,late 200s
14-09-2018T15:39:49,SageSaga,Minecraft is still great
14-09-2018T15:39:51,Bgrmystr2,2000s*
14-09-2018T15:39:54,CrimsonQuill,I have a big creeper plush
14-09-2018T15:39:57,CrimsonQuill,I called him CLiff
14-09-2018T15:40:01,CrimsonQuill,Cliff the Creeper
14-09-2018T15:40:33,Rosscoe,metal gear solid 2 at 2001
14-09-2018T15:40:47,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to head for the night.
14-09-2018T15:40:50,Bgrmystr2,I know SimCity 3000 came out in 1999.. dunno if would have been still super popular in the sim community a few years later
14-09-2018T15:40:52,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight chaps!
14-09-2018T15:41:05,Bgrmystr2,"also, Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 lol"
14-09-2018T15:41:07,Rosscoe,"And Halo, aslo in 2001"
14-09-2018T15:41:08,MatyMaty,WoW
14-09-2018T15:41:11,CrimsonQuill,Halo...
14-09-2018T15:41:13,MatyMaty,"well, it is still a thing"
14-09-2018T15:41:19,Rosscoe,WoW is still going
14-09-2018T15:41:20,Bgrmystr2,RCT2 in 2002
14-09-2018T15:41:22,Rosscoe,Just like FF11
14-09-2018T15:41:27,MatyMaty,but back then like 90% of the people I knew played it
14-09-2018T15:41:27,Bgrmystr2,also gnight Quill
14-09-2018T15:41:30,Rosscoe,But I think FF11 is done with expansions now
14-09-2018T15:41:33,CrimsonQuill,This is Spartan Crimson-201 signing off.
14-09-2018T15:41:38,Mihari,WoW has tapered off a lot.
14-09-2018T15:41:39,Rosscoe,night Quill
14-09-2018T15:41:53,Mihari,"It's still huge, yes, but no where near as played as it used to be"
14-09-2018T15:41:56,MatyMaty,now I only know.... 3 people who play it
14-09-2018T15:43:36,Bgrmystr2,Zro being one of them?
14-09-2018T15:44:02,MatyMaty,"lol, well if Zro does it would make it 43"
14-09-2018T15:44:06,MatyMaty,"er, 4"
14-09-2018T15:44:11,Bgrmystr2,Zro plays a lot of WoW
14-09-2018T15:44:23,Bgrmystr2,"I see him playing it every so often, least once a week"
14-09-2018T15:44:35,Mihari,"Lulz, I just found my original TERA collectors edition box with the 3 disc installation dvds XD"
14-09-2018T15:45:06,Bgrmystr2,"so I guess that makes it 4, Maty :P"
14-09-2018T15:45:24,MatyMaty,I always liked the Tera aesthetics
14-09-2018T15:45:56,Mihari,"I loved it's combat system, visuals, and soundtrack."
14-09-2018T15:46:11,MatyMaty,"even if nowadays the whole ""Korean MMO"" is kind of a meme on itself"
14-09-2018T15:46:12,Mihari,But it was very much a grind game.
14-09-2018T15:47:00,Bgrmystr2,"oh, 3rd person mmorpg"
14-09-2018T15:47:07,Bgrmystr2,that's prolly why I passed it up
14-09-2018T15:47:25,SageSaga,I enjoyed it for a while but then it became too much of a hassle to level and get new gear
14-09-2018T15:48:09,SageSaga,you would think i wouldnt have a big issue with that when im a big MH fanboy but- MH's grind for the most part is a fun grind
14-09-2018T15:48:32,Mihari,^_^;
14-09-2018T15:48:35,SageSaga,they always have a small bit of grind in it that I hate  but for the most part- its just about going out to fight a monster i enjoy fighting
14-09-2018T15:48:54,MatyMaty,"Most people seem to think that, yup :o"
14-09-2018T15:49:23,Rosscoe,"speaking of tera, I gota resitnall it cause the laucnher is acting up again"
14-09-2018T15:49:24,SageSaga,MHW's bad grind is the RNG for decorations- it's awesome if you are Mihari- terrible if you are me
14-09-2018T15:50:03,Mihari,"I think that's the universe being a dick to me, here your life has been giving you shit so have some good gems in a game... balanced right?"
14-09-2018T15:50:12,SageSaga,Mihari - you had the same good luck with Generations RNG too! XD Remember all those talismans?
14-09-2018T15:50:18,Mihari,Yes
14-09-2018T15:50:37,MatyMaty,"You should play online poker, Mihari :P"
14-09-2018T15:50:43,SageSaga,"""Hey- is this any good?"" ""That's a god talisman"" 'How about this"" ""How is that possible?!"""
14-09-2018T15:53:07,SageSaga,"Mihari got an attack gem from a glowing feystone - that's like a .05% drop, i have over 600 hours of combined MHW play time- havent gotten one"
14-09-2018T15:53:38,Bgrmystr2,I know that feel on both sides
14-09-2018T15:54:00,SageSaga,i think she has gotten 2 or 3 of them
14-09-2018T15:54:01,sunblaze,cheetahs luck I guess :D
14-09-2018T15:54:16,Bgrmystr2,Pretty normal RNG imo
14-09-2018T15:54:55,Mihari,Attack gems?
14-09-2018T15:55:59,SageSaga,attack decorations
14-09-2018T15:56:36,Bgrmystr2,:saxophone: :ptv-excited: sage has the sax music now
14-09-2018T15:57:04,SageSaga,ive always had this music
14-09-2018T15:57:08,Bgrmystr2,yeah I know
14-09-2018T15:57:36,Bgrmystr2,first time I thought about it though :thinking:
14-09-2018T15:57:45,MatyMaty,Mmmmmmm I need a new mouse :(
14-09-2018T15:59:48,MatyMaty,I wonder if getting another deathadder or trying a different one :thinking:
14-09-2018T16:00:26,SageSaga,i have a deathadder too- older model- i hear they break down kinda fast
14-09-2018T16:01:16,MatyMaty,"this one lasted over a year, so I dunno if that is fast or not. But the sensor is kinda janky"
14-09-2018T16:01:27,SageSaga,thats really fast imo
14-09-2018T16:01:59,SageSaga,dont they have a 2 year warranty?
14-09-2018T16:02:27,MatyMaty,I don't think they do down here. Remember I had to buy it imported :P
14-09-2018T16:02:43,MatyMaty,Maybe I'll try a corsair or a logitech one
14-09-2018T16:03:24,Bgrmystr2,I've had... 50/50 luck with the logitech mice. They're good quality but I seem to have bad luck
14-09-2018T16:04:02,Bgrmystr2,"I'd still go w/ them though, even so, cuz most mice aren't ergonomic enough"
14-09-2018T16:04:31,Mihari,"Yah, I have 3 attack gems."
14-09-2018T16:04:47,SageSaga,ok so the RNG just gave you 2
14-09-2018T16:04:59,SageSaga,because you automatically get 1 as a gift in game
14-09-2018T16:05:15,Mihari,Yah
14-09-2018T16:08:32,Rosscoe,Gota love the mRandom Number Generators
14-09-2018T16:10:06,SageSaga,if you have a way to manipulate the outcome even to improve your chances by 20 percent i would think it was more fair- because then on average it's just 1/5 times
14-09-2018T16:11:04,SageSaga,but nope- it's all slots all the time
14-09-2018T16:12:18,SageSaga,they even have a method for getting the most rare materials that a monster drops outside of just trying over and over- complete weekly objectives- get a trade in item for a rare material
14-09-2018T16:13:01,Rosscoe,Im not playing MHW hardcore enough for that XD
14-09-2018T16:13:22,SageSaga,you can complete the weekly objectives in a few hours
14-09-2018T16:13:31,CommanderTrace,hii
14-09-2018T16:13:52,SageSaga,heck this weeks i completed 2 of the 3 objectives without trying
14-09-2018T16:16:24,SageSaga,and Mihari and I have been acing the Arenas too
14-09-2018T16:28:05,Rosscoe,I need to finish the main story
14-09-2018T16:28:37,SageSaga,slow boy
14-09-2018T16:29:22,Rosscoe,yea I got more distractions than I care for right now lol
14-09-2018T16:29:42,Rosscoe,"ok im gona go nap for 3 hours, see yeas later!"
14-09-2018T16:30:00,SageSaga,take care!
14-09-2018T16:30:01,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Rosscoe."
