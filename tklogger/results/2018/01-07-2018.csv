01-07-2018T16:13:41,Bgrmystr2,the couple I live with might do some 4th of july stuff.
01-07-2018T16:24:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I just normally celebrate with a Halloween thing for my birthday

01-07-2018T19:17:48,Dadrobit,Used some local raw honey instead of sugar and tossed in a few berries for giggles to see what I got.
01-07-2018T19:18:15,Dadrobit,It's Heckin' Ambrosia is what it is.
01-07-2018T19:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm good

01-07-2018T19:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Then is it really ‚Äúapple‚Äù sauce?
01-07-2018T19:26:09,Dadrobit,Yes?

01-07-2018T19:26:21,Dadrobit,"It's like, 95% apples."
01-07-2018T19:27:31,Dadrobit,Made the mistake of watching food channels on YouTube and was dying for something tasty on a diet.

01-07-2018T20:10:45,Twokinds,Does my brother count as a travel agent?
01-07-2018T20:10:54,CrRAR,lol
01-07-2018T20:10:59,unsteddyphoenix,I guess he...travels a lot?
01-07-2018T20:11:31,CrRAR,He can certainly charm someone with his dulcet tones into getting you the best price xD
01-07-2018T20:11:37,Twokinds,Cause I usually get my hotel rooms for Comic-con through his connections
01-07-2018T20:12:05,unsteddyphoenix,Are they always this pricy?
01-07-2018T20:12:20,Twokinds,Yeah pretty much.
01-07-2018T20:12:49,CrRAR,"Yeah, Cali is just pricey in general... for everything."
01-07-2018T20:12:55,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
01-07-2018T20:13:07,Twokinds,They know they can charge whatever they like during Comic-Con

01-07-2018T20:13:40,Twokinds,4

01-07-2018T20:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And since Mark is a traveler himself maybe he does know better than an agent
01-07-2018T20:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever tried researching yourself
01-07-2018T20:16:32,unsteddyphoenix,sdcc is so big it cant afford to give special rates?
01-07-2018T20:16:41,unsteddyphoenix,Too all the people?
01-07-2018T20:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs what I did for East. For two people. Agent did the flights thing and I got the tickets and hotel
01-07-2018T20:17:13,unsteddyphoenix,Its hard to imagine how big it must be if hotels jack up their prices for it...
01-07-2018T20:18:01,CrRAR,It's a bit like a pilgrimage.
01-07-2018T20:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you want to try my agent and see what she says?
01-07-2018T20:19:06,unsteddyphoenix,to reach nerdvana?
01-07-2018T20:19:14,CrRAR,xD
01-07-2018T20:20:35,Twokinds,Well it doesn't really matter since I'm not the one paying for it

01-07-2018T22:56:24,CrRAR,"lol, yeah, the name ""Edward"" IS in there."
01-07-2018T22:57:03,CrRAR,Maybe it's a Frankenstein of a few differrent things?
01-07-2018T22:59:55,CrRAR,I guess I agree with the hobby of modding games... but not to use them cheaply as cheats against folks wanting to follow the rules.
01-07-2018T23:00:16,TheGamePlayer,grabs flyswatter and frantically starts attacking a fly in the kitchen
01-07-2018T23:00:37,CrRAR,That was my problem earlier only here in my office.
01-07-2018T23:00:57,CrRAR,Much smaller room with MUCH more delicate things in it.
01-07-2018T23:01:23,CrRAR,I just waited till the fly tired himself out. Easy prey~
01-07-2018T23:01:26,TheGamePlayer,Ya I use modds as long as it's ok with everyone in the area around me or in my own private game
01-07-2018T23:01:31,CrRAR,mmm
01-07-2018T23:01:33,Dadrobit,Looks like something off of Wattpad tbh
01-07-2018T23:02:07,CrRAR,hmm
01-07-2018T23:02:23,Twokinds,I'm debating whether or not Puppet Friends is too much for Patreon.

01-07-2018T23:02:49,unsteddyphoenix,Is a more voluptuos character inherently more lewd? :thinking:
01-07-2018T23:03:09,Dadrobit,She's got a doll of her crush sitting between her bewbs
01-07-2018T23:03:10,TheGamePlayer,puppets creep me out
01-07-2018T23:03:19,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, I think Puppet Eric is what does it."
01-07-2018T23:03:27,TheGamePlayer,Lol
01-07-2018T23:03:32,unsteddyphoenix,Damnit Eric
01-07-2018T23:03:38,unsteddyphoenix,How out of character for him
01-07-2018T23:04:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Actually, making it more lewd is entirely IN character nvm"
01-07-2018T23:05:17,unsteddyphoenix,Do they have like...guidelines?
01-07-2018T23:06:02,Twokinds,They don't get very specific

01-07-2018T23:06:17,unsteddyphoenix,Youd think they would CONSIDERING
01-07-2018T23:06:45,Twokinds,"The one thing they said was too much was ""full rear view nudity"""
01-07-2018T23:07:49,Twokinds,They did say Flora was fine 'in the fur' though.
01-07-2018T23:08:02,Twokinds,"I think it's just that, combined with anything that could be 'sexual themes'"
01-07-2018T23:08:02,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
01-07-2018T23:08:16,Twokinds,"So, puppet Eric puts it over the line."
01-07-2018T23:08:52,TheGamePlayer,What's wrong with puppets?
01-07-2018T23:09:06,Dadrobit,"It's what what, it's where."
01-07-2018T23:09:10,Twokinds,Yeah it's the location
01-07-2018T23:09:14,Twokinds,"Anyway, it's no big deal."
01-07-2018T23:09:20,TheGamePlayer,Oh
01-07-2018T23:09:22,Twokinds,I'll post it on Deviantart and Twitter.
01-07-2018T23:09:24,Dadrobit,"Much like real estate, ""Location, Location, Location."""
01-07-2018T23:09:35,TheGamePlayer,Lol
01-07-2018T23:09:48,CrRAR,Okay! lol
01-07-2018T23:10:15,Twokinds,Twitter doesn't care... yet...
01-07-2018T23:10:25,TheGamePlayer,Well Patreon can shove their rules where the sun doesn't shine
01-07-2018T23:10:39,Twokinds,Eh I understand
01-07-2018T23:10:58,Dadrobit,"It's not Patreon yo, it's PayPal and Braintree."
01-07-2018T23:11:01,Twokinds,They gotta appeal their masters.
01-07-2018T23:11:06,TheGamePlayer,I take that back
01-07-2018T23:11:10,Twokinds,appease*
01-07-2018T23:11:21,CrRAR,Yeah I heard that too robit
01-07-2018T23:11:22,TheGamePlayer,Last thing we want is lewd everywhere
01-07-2018T23:11:26,CrRAR,xD
01-07-2018T23:11:54,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I don't think it'll be a problem if you made that one public, tom"
01-07-2018T23:11:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...so annoying
01-07-2018T23:12:00,CrRAR,Who knew the powers that be would be curating the internet ;_;
01-07-2018T23:12:04,Dadrobit,"Rock and a hard place. Either appease the $ and lose some fan support, or support the fans completely, and lose the $ which shuts down the whole damn thing."
01-07-2018T23:12:10,TheGamePlayer,"Pop-up adds, tv commercials, game trailers,"
01-07-2018T23:12:22,CrRAR,It used to be the wild frontier~
01-07-2018T23:12:25,unsteddyphoenix,they should at least like
01-07-2018T23:12:29,unsteddyphoenix,be specific
01-07-2018T23:12:51,Dadrobit,"Nah, being specific can create loopholes for the users to exploit."
01-07-2018T23:13:07,Bgrmystr2,"the fans are what basically pay for patreon, so I'm not expecting it to go very well for em anyway"
01-07-2018T23:13:19,CrRAR,I think it's basically anything that someone could complain about needs to be patron-only.
01-07-2018T23:13:34,TheGamePlayer,I need coffee
01-07-2018T23:13:40,CrRAR,Which is why the rules are so fuzzy and subjective
01-07-2018T23:14:31,CrRAR,"you know that ""not on my christian chat server"" us folks are always blabbering about?"
01-07-2018T23:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,You may be underestimating some people‚Äôs talent in finding something wrong
01-07-2018T23:14:45,TheGamePlayer,Tom how's your coffee bunker doing? Hasn't ran out I hope
01-07-2018T23:15:12,TheGamePlayer,Or is it tea
01-07-2018T23:15:34,Bgrmystr2,"there's no point catering to ppl who complain about stuff to be patreon only, cuz they'll find something new to complain about"
01-07-2018T23:15:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Like Mr. No Free Samples guy or Ms. Too Many Sprinkles
01-07-2018T23:15:38,Bgrmystr2,over and over and over again
01-07-2018T23:15:45,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like that's a lot better than just...randomly deciding case by case
01-07-2018T23:15:50,CrRAR,tru
01-07-2018T23:15:51,Bgrmystr2,till everything is paywalled on patreon
01-07-2018T23:17:08,CrRAR,...and how appropriate that Eric would cause the hubbub. xD
01-07-2018T23:17:24,Bgrmystr2,I don't think there would be any problem if that image was public
01-07-2018T23:17:30,CrRAR,He doesn't even actually WANT to be in there!
01-07-2018T23:17:32,TheGamePlayer,He does draw nude keidran
01-07-2018T23:17:51,CrRAR,Strike #1
01-07-2018T23:18:09,TheGamePlayer,Did I spell that right
01-07-2018T23:18:16,CrRAR,yes
01-07-2018T23:18:22,TheGamePlayer,Ok
01-07-2018T23:18:29,CrRAR,"The ""Strike"" is against Eric, not you lol"
01-07-2018T23:18:39,TheGamePlayer,It's not in my autobank but I should be
01-07-2018T23:18:48,TheGamePlayer,I know
01-07-2018T23:18:50,Dadrobit,"Wait, he doesn't want to be in there? Is this rape? Are you really condoning rape on your Patreon, Tom?!?! This is why!!! /s"
01-07-2018T23:19:07,TheGamePlayer,AHH
01-07-2018T23:19:25,Bgrmystr2,see.... what dadro said? yeah there really are people that think that way
