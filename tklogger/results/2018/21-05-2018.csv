21-05-2018T00:17:42,Twokinds,1 1/2 hours to go.
21-05-2018T00:18:41,Vatruvius,Nice.
21-05-2018T00:18:47,unsteddyphoenix,Wouldnt the liquid get pretty reduced over such a long cook time?
21-05-2018T00:19:09,Vatruvius,Depends on how much liquid and if you add any back and if you are cooking with a lid.
21-05-2018T00:19:16,Twokinds,It gets reduced a little but not that much. It has a lid.
21-05-2018T00:19:18,Dadrobit,Depends on how hot you cook it. Sous Vide temps? Not really.
21-05-2018T00:19:49,unsteddyphoenix,I thought Sous Vide was cooking in a bag
21-05-2018T00:20:00,Twokinds,It's just simmering
21-05-2018T00:20:22,unsteddyphoenix,What's inside it?
21-05-2018T00:20:55,Dadrobit,The reason it's in a bag is to prevent flavor loss of the meat over the long cook period because it's only being cooked at around 130-140F.
21-05-2018T00:21:22,Dadrobit,Was just using it as a reference to the cooking temp rather than method.
21-05-2018T00:21:40,Twokinds,"2lb beef, 2lb carrots, 2lb potatoes, 1lb onions, beef stock and seasoning."
21-05-2018T00:21:47,Vatruvius,Gute Abend frau Kiwi.

21-05-2018T00:22:14,Vatruvius,Danke.
21-05-2018T00:22:18,SiliconCarbide,kein ding!
21-05-2018T00:22:24,Twokinds,"You simmer the beef onions and seasoning for an hour, then with the water level lower, fill it back up with carrots and potatoes."
21-05-2018T00:23:06,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds HEARTY.
21-05-2018T00:23:16,Vatruvius,That sounds really good Tom.
21-05-2018T00:23:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like something to eat off of for days
21-05-2018T00:24:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a big fan of onion but it sounds nice
21-05-2018T00:24:12,unsteddyphoenix,What onion is the best vegetable
21-05-2018T00:24:13,SiliconCarbide,"@Vatruvius technically it should also be ""Fr√§ulein"" instead of ""Frau"", the latter is for married women"
21-05-2018T00:24:22,SiliconCarbide,but no one really uses it anymore
21-05-2018T00:25:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn‚Äôt Fr√§ulein the equivalent of ‚ÄúMs.‚Äù?
21-05-2018T00:26:21,Twokinds,"After 3 hours of simmering, you can't even see the onions anymore."
21-05-2018T00:26:30,Twokinds,They just disintigrate into the broth.
21-05-2018T00:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Flavoring onions are best onions
21-05-2018T00:26:47,unsteddyphoenix,lol

21-05-2018T00:27:14,unsteddyphoenix,Do you fry the onions and beef first?
21-05-2018T00:28:11,Twokinds,No
21-05-2018T00:28:49,Twokinds,You just dump the beef in the soup and skim the fat and junk as it heats up.
21-05-2018T00:30:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Sounds nice and simple, which appeals to me greatly"
21-05-2018T00:30:06,SiliconCarbide,@SpazztasticKiwi Ms. is for unmarried women right? then its the equivalent yes
21-05-2018T00:30:27,SiliconCarbide,but again in german that distinction isnt really in use anymore

21-05-2018T00:46:04,unsteddyphoenix,Where does the bacon come in to the meatloaf?
21-05-2018T00:46:26,Dadrobit,Everywhere if it's done right tbh.
21-05-2018T00:46:52,unsteddyphoenix,Nice

21-05-2018T00:47:58,Twokinds,The bacon is supposed to be laid on top of the loaf.
21-05-2018T00:48:06,Dadrobit,Just a big 'ol pile of bacon in a pan.
21-05-2018T00:48:08,unsteddyphoenix,If it was anything besides the bacon I probably wouldn't have noticed lol
21-05-2018T00:48:15,Dadrobit,lol
21-05-2018T00:48:31,unsteddyphoenix,That wouldve been my guess though
21-05-2018T00:48:46,Twokinds,"Yeah, it's so each slice also gets you bacon."
21-05-2018T00:48:52,Twokinds,Because bacon.

21-05-2018T00:54:32,Dadrobit,I keep honey sticks for a snack if I have to wait an unnatural amount of time for food.
21-05-2018T00:54:48,Twokinds,Whassa honey stick?
21-05-2018T00:55:37,Dadrobit,Little plastic straw full of honey that you bite/cut open on one end to suck on.
21-05-2018T00:56:12,unsteddyphoenix,Like...pixie sticks but honey?
21-05-2018T00:56:44,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, I can't have too much sugar."
21-05-2018T00:56:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, pretty much."
21-05-2018T00:57:09,Dadrobit,And they're super easy to make yourself so you can make them with local honey if you want.
21-05-2018T00:57:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Sugar starts making you sick after a few decades
21-05-2018T00:57:36,unsteddyphoenix,What other spreads do you use?
21-05-2018T00:57:44,unsteddyphoenix,Peanut butter sticks? Jam sticks?
21-05-2018T00:57:47,unsteddyphoenix,Butter sticks?
21-05-2018T00:57:52,Twokinds,Yeah
21-05-2018T00:58:42,Twokinds,I used to have a drawer at my work desk dedicated to snacks. A huge variety of candy boxes. The other side was a drawer for chips and salsa.
21-05-2018T00:58:49,Twokinds,"Man, I miss those days."
21-05-2018T00:58:56,SpazztasticKiwi,That can‚Äôt be sanitary
21-05-2018T00:59:06,Twokinds,The days when I didn't care at all. XD
21-05-2018T00:59:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Right next to the socks huh
21-05-2018T00:59:24,Twokinds,lol no I had an office desk.
21-05-2018T00:59:30,unsteddyphoenix,for snack-related emergencies
21-05-2018T00:59:46,Twokinds,So I could work on twokinds and snacks were within easy idle eating reach.
21-05-2018T00:59:51,unsteddyphoenix,Was one draw just completely salsa and one draw completely chips?
21-05-2018T00:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,So you didn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúbrb‚Äù is mid stream
21-05-2018T01:00:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Open one draw to get chips, another to dip"

21-05-2018T01:00:15,Twokinds,"Well, I had a minifridge for dip."
21-05-2018T01:00:22,Twokinds,Can't just leave that out.
21-05-2018T01:00:31,unsteddyphoenix,I guess~
21-05-2018T01:00:36,unsteddyphoenix,Ruins the mental image though
21-05-2018T01:00:43,Twokinds,heheh
21-05-2018T01:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Why you aiming on getting a house? Sounds like you live in your room as it is
21-05-2018T01:01:00,unsteddyphoenix,The whole house will be his room!
21-05-2018T01:02:01,Twokinds,"I dunno. I feel like it'll be so freeing, finally having a house to myself."
21-05-2018T01:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And your own bills
21-05-2018T01:02:41,Twokinds,I already pay all the bills here.
21-05-2018T01:02:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Well how bout the new neighbors
21-05-2018T01:03:09,Twokinds,I... don't even know my current neighbors.

21-05-2018T01:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I do that anyway
21-05-2018T01:05:30,unsteddyphoenix,Do you make them call you Big Daddy?

21-05-2018T01:06:13,unsteddyphoenix,Lol. Does that come up often?
21-05-2018T01:06:14,Dadrobit,"One of the families that has been around for a few years knows about calling me daddy, the others do not lol."
21-05-2018T01:06:19,SpazztasticKiwi,So you go out with family and it‚Äôs ‚ÄúIve never seen these people in my life‚Äù

21-05-2018T01:12:58,Twokinds,I've never seen a... Jenovah's Witness?
21-05-2018T01:13:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I just tell em ive found Jesus and walk off
21-05-2018T01:13:15,Dadrobit,"Oh man, we are inundated with them over here..."
21-05-2018T01:13:28,unsteddyphoenix,Ive encountered a couple. I assume theyre used to people closing doors on them~
21-05-2018T01:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen two in Walmart before. I‚Äôm less paranoid walking past cops
21-05-2018T01:13:59,Twokinds,It might have to do with us living in a Jewish community.
21-05-2018T01:14:09,Twokinds,But I dunno.
21-05-2018T01:15:29,unsteddyphoenix,At least I understand people trying to sell me things.
21-05-2018T01:15:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Witnesses aren‚Äôt inherently Jewish
21-05-2018T01:15:43,unsteddyphoenix,They always come around early in the morning too.
21-05-2018T01:16:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Wake me up on my day off and I‚Äôll show you what the devil looks like
21-05-2018T01:16:13,Twokinds,lol maybe that's why I've never seen them
21-05-2018T01:16:21,Twokinds,Nothing waking me up in the morning
21-05-2018T01:17:22,Dadrobit,Just answer the door in a half open robe. Achieve maximum discomfort with anyone trying to take away your time.
21-05-2018T01:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"I normally sleep like the dead, but if you do manage to wake me up, I‚Äôm not a nice person"

21-05-2018T01:18:47,SpazztasticKiwi,That would probably work - as modest people they‚Äôd have a hard time talking to you half naked
21-05-2018T01:20:05,unsteddyphoenix,Man I wish I could always wear a robe
21-05-2018T01:20:19,unsteddyphoenix,When is that going to be fashionable
21-05-2018T01:20:42,Twokinds,I don't know what you're talking about
21-05-2018T01:20:50,Twokinds,I always wear a robe.
21-05-2018T01:21:09,Dadrobit,My best work is done in my robes.
21-05-2018T01:21:32,unsteddyphoenix,I dare you to wear a robe at Momocon
21-05-2018T01:21:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Id like one of those really fluffy VS robes
21-05-2018T01:22:14,Twokinds,I feel like a convention is a place where a robe wouldn't be that strange
21-05-2018T01:22:32,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, it seems like it's gunna be raining all through momocon :("
21-05-2018T01:22:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it looks like you‚Äôll be running instead of walking then

21-05-2018T01:26:24,unsteddyphoenix,Tom could conceivably always wear robes then
21-05-2018T01:26:26,unsteddyphoenix,Damnit.

21-05-2018T02:23:02,Dadrobit,Seems like shit talking behind my back is going swimmingly in the fandom :D

21-05-2018T02:24:08,unsteddyphoenix,you must have fun on the forums
21-05-2018T02:28:24,Dadrobit,Fairly sure I know who's behind most of it. Filthy communist I got into an argument with got banned after the mods got sick and tired of him insulting Tom as part of his ranting.
21-05-2018T02:29:00,Dadrobit,He's gone on a minor spree since he's gotten back about mods abusing power and playing favorites with forum members.
21-05-2018T02:29:40,Dadrobit,Then there are others who I'm sure I've ruffled their feathers from having differing opinions with.
21-05-2018T02:30:15,Dadrobit,"Like the one guy who called the murdering of children ""acceptable collateral damage."""
21-05-2018T02:30:36,Dadrobit,"So yeah, I have a ton of fun on the forums. :D"
21-05-2018T02:30:46,unsteddyphoenix,cant make an omelette without breaking a few kids
21-05-2018T02:31:17,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like a lot of work to deal with all of that
21-05-2018T02:32:10,Dadrobit,"You should get your kids from the orphanage, more paperwork up front, but they're less expensive overall."
21-05-2018T02:32:30,Dadrobit,Gotta be economic about your omelettes.
21-05-2018T02:32:53,Dadrobit,economically responsible I should say.
21-05-2018T02:33:20,unsteddyphoenix,Are street urchins still a thing? That sounds easiest of all
21-05-2018T02:35:15,Dadrobit,Didn't we come to the consensus that Maddie has the voice of an English street urchin? I'd just feel bad then if I went for them knowing that.
21-05-2018T02:35:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"To escape the fun of pregnancy and get the ability to have my own kid, I‚Äôd consider adoption"
21-05-2018T02:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm not sterile, just terrified of being pregnant"
21-05-2018T02:37:04,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm that's true...when I think of kids as little Maddie's or maeves it becomes a lot sadder for some reason
21-05-2018T02:39:23,Dadrobit,Go after Karen and you can get yourself some green eggs and ham!
21-05-2018T02:39:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Though motherhood doesn‚Äôt seem to suit me at the moment now either
21-05-2018T02:40:02,Dadrobit,Nobody cares about Karen anyways :D
21-05-2018T02:41:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I would adopt Karen
21-05-2018T02:41:43,SpazztasticKiwi,In a heartbeat
21-05-2018T02:42:39,Dadrobit,"Always figured that if I ever changed my mind about kids, I'd just adopt."
21-05-2018T02:42:58,Dadrobit,Get one that's 8 or 9 already. Properly housebroken.
21-05-2018T02:44:19,unsteddyphoenix,That doesn't sound as bad
21-05-2018T02:44:33,unsteddyphoenix,Just get cats though....
21-05-2018T02:44:38,Bgrmystr2,8? 9? housebroken? Your house is gonna be broken alright if you get a kid at that age :V
21-05-2018T02:45:33,Dadrobit,"Nah, by that age they'll have an appreciation of how fortunate they are, won't be as much of a handfull."
21-05-2018T02:46:10,Bgrmystr2,if you say so. I've never met a kid at that age with that level of maturity ever.
21-05-2018T02:46:15,Bgrmystr2,and I've met a lot of kids in my life lol
21-05-2018T02:47:27,Dadrobit,"And if you wait much longer, you run the risk of getting one coming into pre-teen and teen angst and rebellion."
21-05-2018T02:47:58,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. they literally ALL do that so..
21-05-2018T02:48:07,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-05-2018T02:49:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but by adopting, I get a certain amount of authority through the appreciation of being rescued from the orphanage. (And the threat of sending them back)"

21-05-2018T02:52:32,unsteddyphoenix,Dark

21-05-2018T02:55:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Still not a fan of pro creating
21-05-2018T02:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Thing is I know a lady who can‚Äôt have kids - had multiple miscarriages - and she‚Äôs slightly upset at my lack of desire for kids
21-05-2018T02:59:06,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, can understand where she's comin from"
21-05-2018T03:00:44,unsteddyphoenix,Just tell her yours don't work either
21-05-2018T03:01:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I won‚Äôt be able to tell if I have the same infertility problem as her unless I try for a baby and miscarry myself
21-05-2018T03:03:58,unsteddyphoenix,It's called lying~
21-05-2018T03:04:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm closer to that family than that
21-05-2018T03:05:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Her niece is one of my close friends. I‚Äôve been over many many times
21-05-2018T03:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure if her problem was that the egg wouldn‚Äôt attach or she kept getting ectopic pregnancies
21-05-2018T03:16:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna go on to bed now
21-05-2018T03:16:45,Dadrobit,night night
