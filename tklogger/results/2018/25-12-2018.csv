25-12-2018T15:54:14,CrimsonQuill,I'm back on now.
25-12-2018T15:59:22,CrimsonQuill,Anything interesting happen?

25-12-2018T16:51:10,CrimsonQuill,?
25-12-2018T16:51:47,TerraTheWizard,1) quotes
25-12-2018T16:51:55,CrimsonQuill,I know
25-12-2018T16:52:01,TerraTheWizard,2) what dadro said

25-12-2018T16:53:37,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
25-12-2018T16:53:56,TerraTheWizard,so i just had an interesting time looking up an artist....
25-12-2018T16:54:12,TerraTheWizard,they sign all their work & credit it in the description under ther twitter handle
25-12-2018T16:54:26,TerraTheWizard,which is different to their username on that art site
25-12-2018T16:54:36,TerraTheWizard,and they don't post the art on their twitter
25-12-2018T16:55:12,TerraTheWizard,so i ended up confused if they were the artist or not
25-12-2018T16:55:37,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
25-12-2018T16:58:22,CrimsonQuill,I'm about to enter a new era of my life.
25-12-2018T16:58:34,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to draw at least one big thing every week.

25-12-2018T16:59:35,CrimsonQuill,Because these past six months have been a VERY mixed bag.
25-12-2018T17:00:07,CrimsonQuill,"Still, could be worse."
25-12-2018T17:00:35,CrimsonQuill,At least I'm reading Calvin and Hobbes again-that's always fun.
25-12-2018T17:08:51,Dadrobit,"Hold on, Terra. I'm actually not following that. The artist's signature on the art is different from the art site pseudonym, but is instead the same as the twitter account that doesn't post the art?"
25-12-2018T17:09:11,Dadrobit,art site's*
25-12-2018T17:09:21,TerraTheWizard,yeah
25-12-2018T17:09:37,TerraTheWizard,"it is them because they link their accounts in a pinned tweet, but it's weird"

25-12-2018T17:10:55,Dadrobit,Or dudette.
25-12-2018T17:12:40,Dadrobit,That was THE THING that was pounded into me in mine. Gotta get your branding out there on as many platforms as possible while maintaining maximum levels of quality and (here's the important bit) consistency.

25-12-2018T23:36:32,Bgrmystr2,"how exactly is a fanpage ""official"" if it's a fanpage? xD"
25-12-2018T23:37:05,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s astonishing how I manage to keep my smartass remarks to myself sometimes
25-12-2018T23:37:17,CommanderTrace,:joy:

25-12-2018T23:38:05,unsteddyphoenix,Its perfect
25-12-2018T23:38:12,CommanderTrace,xD
25-12-2018T23:38:24,Bgrmystr2,It's officially unofficial.
25-12-2018T23:38:27,Bgrmystr2,confirmt
25-12-2018T23:39:22,CommanderTrace,is the Twokinds instagram account your account Tom?
25-12-2018T23:39:45,Bgrmystr2,I don't think tom has an instagram account
25-12-2018T23:40:20,Bgrmystr2,"if you're talking about the one named two.kinds that one isn't tom, it's Neon"
25-12-2018T23:40:46,CommanderTrace,oh ok
25-12-2018T23:41:04,Bgrmystr2,"so it, too, is officially unofficial"
25-12-2018T23:41:37,CommanderTrace,because I have linked him
25-12-2018T23:41:52,CommanderTrace,yes xD
25-12-2018T23:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you guys seen the cringe-tastic police video where they’re checking the guy for weapons and end up grabbing...something else?
25-12-2018T23:46:47,Twokinds,Yes I don't maintain any social media personally other than my twitter.
25-12-2018T23:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It just rolled past my feed again and I got second and third hand embarrassment yet again
25-12-2018T23:47:58,unsteddyphoenix,This is where you get a social media manager
25-12-2018T23:48:08,unsteddyphoenix,And yeah I actually have seen that one spazz
25-12-2018T23:48:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Iliar sorta manages the IG
25-12-2018T23:48:24,unsteddyphoenix,Apparently it happens to guys in airports too sometimes
25-12-2018T23:48:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor souls
