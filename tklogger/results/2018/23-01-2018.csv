23-01-2018T20:51:44,Twokinds,I know OF it. But haven't seen the show.
23-01-2018T20:51:44,Bgrmystr2,Autocorrect is worse at both spelling and grammar than I am. It has absolutely no idea what it's doing. xD Not my friend. Zero faith.
23-01-2018T20:52:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,more for me then
23-01-2018T20:53:04,Bgrmystr2,You are free to take all of the auto-correct. I do not need it. :)
23-01-2018T20:53:51,BluePhantom90,guess I know why The Thundercats 2011 didn't last long. All the people that wanted to watched were away (Me in Afghanistan) or just didn't bather to watch it
23-01-2018T20:54:26,Bgrmystr2,most of the people who watched that show are not kids anymore and don't have the time to watch it
23-01-2018T20:54:39,Bgrmystr2,They're busy with school or work
23-01-2018T20:55:12,Bgrmystr2,so those who watched it were the new generation that DID have the time

23-01-2018T23:51:25,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: mmhm
23-01-2018T23:54:44,Dadrobit,Going through the stuff I recorded earlier. 36 minutes of audio. 58 seconds are what I could sift out as high quality. GG
23-01-2018T23:55:48,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
23-01-2018T23:55:52,unsteddyphoenix,Very high standartds
23-01-2018T23:55:53,Dadrobit,"Still, I kinda expected that. It's still something I can work with."
23-01-2018T23:56:38,Dadrobit,"Ehhh, there was plenty of dead space which is easy to spot and pass over."
23-01-2018T23:56:56,Dadrobit,Probably 2/3rds were just dead space between takes.
23-01-2018T23:57:05,Dadrobit,was*
23-01-2018T23:57:26,unsteddyphoenix,"so, 1/12ths usable basically"
23-01-2018T23:57:27,Unenlagia,"I'm sorry, what were you recording?"
23-01-2018T23:57:44,Dadrobit,Just that a lot of takes were ruined by clicks and unpleasent side effects of creating the sound.
23-01-2018T23:58:00,Dadrobit,And have you ever tried to record a cat? It's almost impossible.
23-01-2018T23:58:17,unsteddyphoenix,Actually ive had to record some dialogue for a class before
23-01-2018T23:58:17,Dadrobit,I was recording SFX for a video for my sound design class.
23-01-2018T23:58:33,unsteddyphoenix,And had to record our own foley
23-01-2018T23:58:50,unsteddyphoenix,Was hard. Thankfully I live in a pretty quiet area.
23-01-2018T23:59:02,Dadrobit,"Foley is gonna be a day long project for me, gonna turn my garage into a foley pit!"
23-01-2018T23:59:18,unsteddyphoenix,Though I must've looked weird to anyone watching me open and close the car boot at 2am
23-01-2018T23:59:21,Dadrobit,Footsteps for days
23-01-2018T23:59:23,unsteddyphoenix,Oooo cool.
