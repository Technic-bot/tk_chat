16-05-2018T11:54:35,Twokinds,Me too!
16-05-2018T12:00:29,Dadrobit,:( One more class and I'm done.
16-05-2018T12:00:38,Dadrobit,Cram class over the summer.
16-05-2018T12:01:41,Dadrobit,"Oh, and I made that curry-stuffed-meatball dish last night."
16-05-2018T12:01:50,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/71y2XBv.jpg
16-05-2018T12:02:00,Dadrobit,Was actually amazing.
16-05-2018T12:02:11,Dadrobit,Thanks for the inspiration lol.
16-05-2018T12:03:53,Twokinds,:D
16-05-2018T12:04:01,Twokinds,Glad it turned out good!
16-05-2018T12:09:58,Dadrobit,"Only bad part was prep time. Near two hours to make. Probably less time in the future since I almost know what I'm doing now, but man, that's a killer time to wait for food that you can't avoid smelling the whole time."
16-05-2018T12:16:55,Twokinds,lol yeah that's quite a bit.
16-05-2018T12:53:35,Combak,"Huh, looks nice."
16-05-2018T14:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey look food ü•ò
16-05-2018T14:35:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm thinking more waffly thoughts but nice
16-05-2018T16:05:17,Twokinds,I wish I had food.
16-05-2018T16:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Go make some
16-05-2018T16:08:10,Twokinds,Can't. Diet.
16-05-2018T16:08:34,SpazztasticKiwi,You realize diet doesn‚Äôt mean eat only once a day right
16-05-2018T16:10:12,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
16-05-2018T16:10:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or make something, ya know, healthy like fruit salad"
16-05-2018T16:10:48,Twokinds,"Fruit contains sugar, which is bad for you."
16-05-2018T16:12:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Natural sugar though. That‚Äôs the difference and I‚Äôm not saying eat a tub full
16-05-2018T16:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Or invest in actual salads. And oatmeal
16-05-2018T16:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,As for real food - fish. Relatively low fat and lots of good stuff
16-05-2018T16:17:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I also realize I‚Äôm probably making you hungry more than anything. You could also do something that makes you lose your appetite
16-05-2018T16:29:25,Bgrmystr2,"Sugar isn't bad for you. Too much of it is, though"
16-05-2018T16:29:42,Bgrmystr2,you need sugar for a balanced diet :u
16-05-2018T16:30:54,SiliconCarbide,is alcohol part of a balanced diet too?
16-05-2018T16:31:33,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: no? Why would you think that
16-05-2018T16:31:44,SiliconCarbide,well crap!
16-05-2018T16:32:19,Twokinds,I took your advice and made a salad. :D
16-05-2018T16:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-excited:
16-05-2018T16:32:52,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-katdryer: what dressing?
16-05-2018T16:32:57,Twokinds,"Iceburg lettuce, bell pepper, and carrots. Simple, but effective."
16-05-2018T16:33:28,Twokinds,6 oz of ranch dressing.
16-05-2018T16:33:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Good ol ranch. More of a Italian person myself
16-05-2018T16:33:57,Twokinds,XD
16-05-2018T16:34:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless said ranch has bacon
16-05-2018T16:34:16,Twokinds,"I'm kidding, it's California French. Light."
16-05-2018T16:34:31,Twokinds,Though I usually use italian.
16-05-2018T16:34:41,Twokinds,Since it's a lot less sugar.
16-05-2018T16:34:42,Bgrmystr2,the only ranch I ever liked was on lays chips lol
16-05-2018T16:34:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure I‚Äôve ever heard of California French
16-05-2018T16:35:09,Twokinds,"It's a lot like french, but californian."
16-05-2018T16:35:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Though isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúCalifornia French‚Äù a bit of a contradiction
16-05-2018T16:35:31,Twokinds,It's like a less sharp version of Russian.
16-05-2018T16:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably slower too
16-05-2018T16:37:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bad pun I know, but I‚Äôm full of em"
16-05-2018T16:39:00,Twokinds,"Growing up, I didn't like Ranch. French was my go-to, because it's sweet. Unfortunately, that sweetness also means it's not healthy, and kinda defeats the purpose of a salad."
16-05-2018T16:39:03,Twokinds,But it tastes good!
16-05-2018T16:40:35,SiliconCarbide,"ive never put anything but oil salt and pepper into my salads &lt;.&lt;, googling those dressings makes me want to try them though"
16-05-2018T16:40:50,SiliconCarbide,also it appears wikipedia has a cookbook:recipies entry
16-05-2018T16:40:51,SiliconCarbide,who knew
16-05-2018T16:42:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Dressing is supposed to be used as a topping. The problem is some people don‚Äôt use it like that
16-05-2018T16:43:11,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúDrown the lettuce. I‚Äôm so healthy‚Äù
16-05-2018T17:06:11,Trevuxnouxe,Im setting up a steam account on a imac...... slow as fuck!
16-05-2018T17:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn‚Äôt know fuck was slow :ptv-snicker:

16-05-2018T17:17:29,Bgrmystr2,"fuck is very slow, kiwi :v"
16-05-2018T17:17:34,Bgrmystr2,you should get with the times xD
16-05-2018T17:18:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah that takes effort :ptv-hearts:
16-05-2018T17:20:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll stay in this little world of mine here. People here are more enjoyable :ptv-dealwithit:
16-05-2018T17:26:32,Bgrmystr2,Then stay in your hole under your rock and continue to not know things while the rest of us continue to learn new ways to ruin everything :ptv-condescending:
16-05-2018T17:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I learn ok from conversation here
16-05-2018T17:33:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Living under a rock seems to be working for Tom, after all"
16-05-2018T17:34:31,Trevuxnouxe,"Due to the lack of a GOOD computer, i no longer can try out twokinds online......"
16-05-2018T17:35:06,Trevuxnouxe,Steam is reatarded. So is my Mcdumbass computer
16-05-2018T17:40:45,Bgrmystr2,"lol you severely underestimate the lacking in your abilities, Kiwi"
16-05-2018T17:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Time to save for a new computer maybe?
16-05-2018T18:30:52,Trevuxnouxe,Im McAss broke
