05-11-2018T01:12:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll at least have it done for then. Gives me time to try getting on someone else‚Äôs panel
05-11-2018T01:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,And she‚Äôs likely asleep now too so
05-11-2018T01:18:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"So now I ask Where‚Äôs your art, TOM"
05-11-2018T01:22:42,Twokinds,I can't draw
05-11-2018T01:23:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll take your word for it then
05-11-2018T01:23:03,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-uneasy: It's okay tom, I can't draw either"
05-11-2018T01:25:26,ZRO4825,I can draw. As long as someone else does the sketching first. :joy:
05-11-2018T01:25:50,FennexTheFox,"i mean, some people will pay for others to clean up their sketches"
05-11-2018T01:26:38,ZRO4825,"Ha, I'd be lucky if anyone wanted to give me THAT level of credit, lol"
05-11-2018T01:27:20,ZRO4825,"I've had fun doing lines over a few of Fluff and Tom's sketch work, but their sketches they release are typically pretty damned clean compared to most sketches, lol"
05-11-2018T01:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I can do some mean straight lines but after awhile my hand locks up or starts shaking
05-11-2018T01:28:24,FennexTheFox,my hand is too shaky too kiwi
05-11-2018T01:29:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve also noticed that I can draw realistic worth a damn but I can spit out a good stylized one
05-11-2018T01:29:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Best example is Ethan‚Äôs 500,000 sub thing I did"
05-11-2018T01:30:23,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs all in what you find fits best for your mind to translate out on paper
05-11-2018T01:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And practice
05-11-2018T01:30:46,ZRO4825,My mind does every fuckin style I've seen...and my hands refuse to do ANY of them. :rofl:
05-11-2018T01:33:02,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúNah I don‚Äôt really FEEL like it‚Äù
05-11-2018T01:36:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Isn‚Äôt past 12, Tom"
05-11-2018T01:36:47,Bgrmystr2,it's past 1am for him
05-11-2018T01:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hinting at. Though I guess he could be changing up that schedule
05-11-2018T01:37:53,SpazztasticKiwi,If it‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs not paying attention
05-11-2018T01:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Since I‚Äôm off tomorrow I aim to be up a lil longer. Watching YouTube

05-11-2018T13:23:57,Bgrmystr2,here's hoping
05-11-2018T13:24:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Well after almost dying yesterday that makes sense
05-11-2018T13:24:35,Bgrmystr2,"he was planning on it since last week, nothin really to do with yesterday at all"
05-11-2018T13:25:18,Bgrmystr2,"anycase, I'ma run. Seeya later kiwi. :)"
05-11-2018T13:30:29,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-greetings: do the shops
05-11-2018T13:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I have managed to cut myself with my own thumbnail
05-11-2018T13:36:35,ZRO4825,I've done that.
05-11-2018T13:36:37,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-SteelwormHades:
05-11-2018T13:36:40,ZRO4825,Fun times.
05-11-2018T13:39:55,Twokinds,I've actually done that too.
05-11-2018T13:43:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you got nails, I‚Äôm sure everyone has"
05-11-2018T13:43:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôve been doing it alot lately and I‚Äôve even cut them down and it‚Äôs still doing it
05-11-2018T13:49:30,Boxthefox,have you guys cut yourselfs with out realising how did u cut yourself how is just me that happens?
05-11-2018T13:50:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I once slammed my finger in a door and didn‚Äôt realize I busted the nail until I felt blood and it wouldn‚Äôt stop throbbing
05-11-2018T13:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Went up to the teacher to ask to go to the nurse and had to wait since she was talking to someone
05-11-2018T13:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"And she was ‚Äúoh dear, yes! Go - just go; Why didn‚Äôt you say something?!‚Äù"
05-11-2018T13:52:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Like don‚Äôt panic. If anyone should be panicking it should be me
05-11-2018T13:52:31,Boxthefox,i was in a party i was grabbing something i look to my finger is just blood coming out and i feel no pain. i think i cut myself on like a corner of a table to make so that happens
05-11-2018T13:53:47,Boxthefox,i was like how did this happen
05-11-2018T13:56:33,Boxthefox,how do get your finger slammed by a door and dont notice it?
05-11-2018T13:56:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I felt a pinch
05-11-2018T13:56:54,Boxthefox,jesus
05-11-2018T13:57:23,Boxthefox,when i was a kid i slammed 4 of my fingers in a door was like 1 hour of pain in cold water
05-11-2018T13:57:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"But it was a pinch, and since I‚Äôve bit my nails for so long, pain in my fingers doesn‚Äôt always go noticed"
05-11-2018T13:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn‚Äôt really start hurting till I looked at it
05-11-2018T14:00:45,Boxthefox,but like do you feel pain when like u slam your finger on the foot on a corner of an object?
05-11-2018T14:01:00,Boxthefox,that hurts alot
05-11-2018T14:02:00,Boxthefox,recently when that happen i think i broke my bone or snap it
05-11-2018T14:02:15,Boxthefox,just couldnt feel my finger
05-11-2018T14:04:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think it has to do with not paying attention. The body may get an injury but not feel it till later cause you‚Äôre on a task and because of a quirk in the survival instinct, you don‚Äôt feel it"
05-11-2018T14:05:01,Boxthefox,probably that i have injured myself some many times and not realising it
05-11-2018T14:06:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains why some can break something and not realize somethings wrong until much later
05-11-2018T14:09:38,Boxthefox,so Tom any new ideas for twokinds?
05-11-2018T14:10:54,Boxthefox,"like sketch,character ideas, more stuff from the back burner?"
05-11-2018T14:27:15,Boxthefox,i shouldnt have ask that actually is a dumb question XD
05-11-2018T14:28:23,SpazztasticKiwi,üêù on windshield. I said hi. She leave
05-11-2018T14:41:02,SpazztasticKiwi,That tiger shark sketch just go me going ‚Äúbaby shark do do do do do do‚Äù
05-11-2018T14:41:17,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôm not a fan
05-11-2018T14:49:45,Boxthefox,good luck getting that out of ur head when seeing that sketch
05-11-2018T14:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,So there‚Äôs this hibachi place here. Debating whether I need it
05-11-2018T14:56:40,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
05-11-2018T14:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
05-11-2018T14:57:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Duckie
05-11-2018T15:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs weird how I like lil baby animals but a human baby I just :ptv-kippi2:
05-11-2018T15:02:17,Boxthefox,lets be real a baby animal is more cute
05-11-2018T15:02:48,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
05-11-2018T15:03:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen zoos that have baby snow leopards
05-11-2018T15:04:08,SpazztasticKiwi,They are the most precious little balls of angry fluff you‚Äôll ever see and I want to hold one
05-11-2018T15:04:47,Boxthefox,i never saw a baby exotic animal
05-11-2018T15:04:53,Boxthefox,not even on zoos
05-11-2018T15:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen juveniles
05-11-2018T15:05:24,SpazztasticKiwi,But the leopard cubs they tend to keep out of public eye
05-11-2018T15:06:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if they‚Äôre orphan cubs I think there‚Äôs a zoo that‚Äôll let you hold one, since the orphan cubs are raised by humans by default of their mother‚Äôs death"
05-11-2018T15:07:14,Boxthefox,on my country orphan cubs are literly dogs and cats
05-11-2018T15:07:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Baby snow leopards: tiny balls of snuggle fluff
05-11-2018T15:07:54,Boxthefox,because they are the most animals that get abadoned and we dont have  a climate for exotic animals
05-11-2018T15:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Adults are just slightly larger balls of snuggle fluff
05-11-2018T15:08:31,SpazztasticKiwi,And they‚Äôre the smallest ‚Äúbig‚Äù (wild) cat
05-11-2018T15:09:01,Boxthefox,adult animals are literly boring on zoos they just sit thats why seeing by your own on the wild is nice
05-11-2018T15:09:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I went to I believe the Atlanta zoo and their snow leopards were absolute show offs
05-11-2018T15:10:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"They came right up to the show glass, stretched, pawed at you, play fought with each other"
05-11-2018T15:10:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Rubbed on the glass too. Camera hogs, the both of em"
05-11-2018T15:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Either Atlanta or Birmingham zoo
05-11-2018T15:11:22,Boxthefox,they were talking in keidran with body language thats why u dont know what they say XD
05-11-2018T15:11:38,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôm cute. Feed me‚Äù
05-11-2018T15:12:21,Boxthefox,xd
05-11-2018T15:13:27,Boxthefox,brb
05-11-2018T15:15:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"They look much like the clouded leopard, but cloudeds have more dark grey rather than a smoke grey and darker russets"
05-11-2018T15:16:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And snow leopards can purr
05-11-2018T15:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I have found a new friend
05-11-2018T15:20:40,Xexanoth,pumas can also purr...and squeak
05-11-2018T15:21:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Snow leopards mew like a house cat I swear
05-11-2018T15:22:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Tiny inchworm frend
05-11-2018T15:22:26,Xexanoth,give him tiny leaves
05-11-2018T15:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no leaf
05-11-2018T15:23:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I found him on the car

05-11-2018T20:49:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Same but, all the time"
05-11-2018T20:49:49,THETOXICATOR,Not mine
05-11-2018T20:51:12,THETOXICATOR,Need to go almost 3am bye
05-11-2018T20:54:14,Mippy,And I really wanted to ink my canvas today too. Stupid sick...
05-11-2018T20:55:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you desire to see inked art
05-11-2018T20:57:43,Dadrobit,Sure
05-11-2018T20:57:45,Mippy,Do you have some?
05-11-2018T20:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I could toss you some of my old Twitter stuff
05-11-2018T20:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs not colored since I mainly work with b&w line work but
05-11-2018T21:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And if all else fails there‚Äôs Tom‚Äôs Patreon
05-11-2018T21:04:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Get that Good‚Ñ¢Ô∏è art fix there
05-11-2018T21:06:54,Mippy,Definitely. I love hunting through the Patreon and Tom‚Äôs deviant art.
05-11-2018T21:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a cute lil Flora toe stretchie on IG
05-11-2018T21:09:02,Mippy,Part of my ‚Äúcollection‚Äù came from older Deviant Art post.
05-11-2018T21:09:35,Mippy,Toe stretching? Oh my...sounds cute.

05-11-2018T21:11:02,SpazztasticKiwi,And here‚Äôs my favorite piece I‚Äôve done so far https://twitter.com/spazztastickiwi/status/922876586751332353?s=21
05-11-2018T21:11:27,Mippy,Now that is a good morning stretch
05-11-2018T21:12:08,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-soon:
05-11-2018T21:12:30,Mippy,Oh my god! It‚Äôs for Ethan! He‚Äôs so cute
05-11-2018T21:12:48,Mippy,Ord being ominous
05-11-2018T21:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan‚Äôs just a few days younger than me
05-11-2018T21:13:39,unsteddyphoenix,Nice ink and nice peets
05-11-2018T21:13:41,Ordithus,Couldn't help myself.  Good evenin'
05-11-2018T21:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Thats also the first of the 20ish panel project I‚Äôm fiddling with
05-11-2018T21:14:19,unsteddyphoenix,hihi
05-11-2018T21:14:59,Mippy,"Dang, 20. Nice Kiwi"
05-11-2018T21:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I have like four done
05-11-2018T21:16:45,Mippy,I‚Äôll be back in a moment. Switch to PC because I‚Äôm cold and the bed is warm.
05-11-2018T21:16:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Now quick bury it in chat before Tom sees the self promo
05-11-2018T21:17:23,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
05-11-2018T21:17:24,Bgrmystr2,"fairly sure it's fine, it's not like you're trying to steal ppl from tom's stream chat to watch you instead"
05-11-2018T21:17:45,Bgrmystr2,like most other ppl commonly do with self-promo
05-11-2018T21:18:12,Ordithus,"Yeah, this is all ""after-hours"" chat anyway"
05-11-2018T21:18:27,Bgrmystr2,that too
05-11-2018T21:22:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Mask was success. Face is smooth n saft now
05-11-2018T21:22:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I will now nom cheeze its
05-11-2018T21:25:01,Mippy,"Yum, smooth skin"
05-11-2018T21:27:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Pulls out some hairs too
05-11-2018T21:27:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Fun
05-11-2018T21:28:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Not recommended for those with much or thick beards mustaches or otherwise
05-11-2018T21:28:33,Mippy,Soon be time to pluck the ladybeard hair again
05-11-2018T21:29:18,Dadrobit,So you're saying that I probably shouldn't do that myself?
05-11-2018T21:30:04,Ordithus,Might want to avoid that
05-11-2018T21:30:53,Mippy,I have no problum with a man taking care of his skin...but you may want to choose a different mask
05-11-2018T21:32:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you like home job face waxing
05-11-2018T21:33:15,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows: Every thing can be a kink if you find the right person Kiwi
05-11-2018T21:33:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"In which case: acquire a good grip on section, and pull in one swift motion in the direction of hair growth"
05-11-2018T21:34:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Go ahead and feel free to scream at this moment I wont blame you
05-11-2018T21:34:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Especially if it‚Äôs particularly thick hair, a large patch, or if it‚Äôs your first time"
05-11-2018T21:35:36,unsteddyphoenix,In my case it'd be all of the above
05-11-2018T21:35:41,unsteddyphoenix,Thanks no thanks
05-11-2018T21:36:03,Mippy,I want to try one of those peel off masks. Reminds me of peeling glue off my hand in elementry.
05-11-2018T21:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre satisfying
05-11-2018T21:36:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially the luckyfine blackhead mask I got
05-11-2018T21:37:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Pulls off dead skin and gummed up pores from their root
05-11-2018T21:37:43,Bgrmystr2,"fuck some hair pulling, that's always been dumb imo"
05-11-2018T21:37:46,Bgrmystr2,cuz the hairs still grow back
05-11-2018T21:37:53,Bgrmystr2,even if you pull the root
05-11-2018T21:38:00,Bgrmystr2,my leg is a perf example
05-11-2018T21:38:06,Mippy,Dang...I've been trying to get rid of my nose spots for a while. I figure i'm not getting deep enough
05-11-2018T21:38:16,Bgrmystr2,"cuz they waxed one part of my leg to show what it was like, and fuck that never again"
05-11-2018T21:38:20,Bgrmystr2,and my hair grew back.
05-11-2018T21:38:23,Bgrmystr2,so... useless
05-11-2018T21:38:27,SpazztasticKiwi,The one I just used though is Aztec healing clay. It will pull out head hair if it gets in it and you pick it out instead of washing
05-11-2018T21:39:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but girls are socially pressured to have smooth skin and oddly enough waxing lasts a little longer than shaving so it gets chosen
05-11-2018T21:39:24,Mippy,"Yes, fuck societal norms imposed on women by men."
05-11-2018T21:39:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Anyway, LuckyFine is about $5-$6 on Amazon"
05-11-2018T21:40:15,Mippy,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
05-11-2018T21:40:48,SpazztasticKiwi,The Aztec mask was like $8ish
05-11-2018T21:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I think
05-11-2018T21:41:01,Mippy,Hmmm...i haven't made a Amazon order in a while. Evenn in CAD that's cheeper than Sephora
05-11-2018T21:41:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs like a big pound tub of clay tho so
05-11-2018T21:42:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But you gotta mix it with water (purified or I think distilled is recommended) or ACV
05-11-2018T21:42:33,Mippy,Dang! I had a small tub as a gift once and it lasted months. Wonder how long a pound would last.
05-11-2018T21:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"and when I say luckyfine smells like a flower field, oh boy"
05-11-2018T21:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"That Aztec clay does not, though that‚Äôs mainly because I use the ACV and it stinks, not the clay"
05-11-2018T21:44:53,Mippy,I'd probuby just get water from our water cooler. It's purified...or something.
05-11-2018T21:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And it says you‚Äôre not supposed to use a metal bowl or utensil to mix it as that will activate the clay prematurely
05-11-2018T21:45:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"The tub I got has these instructions. If you get the tub, it‚Äôll probably tell the same"
05-11-2018T21:45:43,Mippy,i's got there plastic !
05-11-2018T21:46:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I also have two Freeman‚Äôs brand face masks
05-11-2018T21:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Ones a scrub that will take a good layer of dead skin off and polish your face like a marble
05-11-2018T21:47:54,Mippy,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot: I have one...I guess I have to step up my skin care game
05-11-2018T21:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And the other is an avocado oatmeal moisturizing clay mask. A good follow up to the first. And it smells so good
05-11-2018T21:48:42,Mippy,It's one of those dead skin removing types
05-11-2018T21:48:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve accumulated these over a bit of time. And my skins nowhere near perfect. I use them so it doesn‚Äôt get worse, and you know how skin is"
05-11-2018T21:49:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It will get worse if it wants too
05-11-2018T21:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I also have three other mini ones but they‚Äôre not real special. I got them to try on discount and I‚Äôm not too thrilled
05-11-2018T21:51:38,Mippy,"My skin has never been much of a problum. It gets dry, but is mostly clear (except my nose spots). I do get a couple of face demons around ""that time"". It's mostly good if I don't use anything I'm allergic to."
05-11-2018T21:51:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I find it helps hormonal acne to use the scrub and avocado masks
05-11-2018T21:53:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mainly the scrub since dry skin builds around my nose (nose is dry but my general face isn‚Äôt really, so idk)"
05-11-2018T21:55:01,Mippy,I may have to give that a go and see how it works for me.

05-11-2018T22:40:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Dang. PAX tickets go up soon and they‚Äôve decided to keep it at four days
05-11-2018T22:41:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"If Tom was tempted to go, I‚Äôd try for it but I may end up skipping this year"
05-11-2018T22:44:43,Mippy,I don't have the money for that type of thing right now. Out of country travel is expencive. Any plans to come to Canada Tom?
05-11-2018T22:44:59,Mippy,XD
05-11-2018T22:46:45,Twokinds,"Hey, it'd be expensive for me too!"
05-11-2018T22:47:01,SpazztasticKiwi,That was why I went to East last year. Jacksepticeye isn‚Äôt American so I went to see him primarily since Mark likes to go to almost all the American cons
05-11-2018T22:47:03,Ordithus,"Just paddle across the lake, you'll be fine"
05-11-2018T22:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And Ethan tries
05-11-2018T22:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I also want to try for Tupelo con since it‚Äôs close for me and will be relatively cheap
05-11-2018T22:49:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôd figure you‚Äôd pass on East cause of how crowded it can be Tom, though I feel the cost issue"

05-11-2018T22:49:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Seriously last year it got to where if I got bumped into one more time I‚Äôd scream

05-11-2018T22:52:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And dear God I never met him but seeing Ethan in person he is tall boi
05-11-2018T22:53:09,Mippy,I've never seen any of them in person. I'm waiting for the day. :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
05-11-2018T22:54:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Don‚Äôt believe Mark saying he‚Äôs short. He‚Äôs around my height, from what I could tell"
05-11-2018T22:54:47,Mippy,One day I'll get a tour location close to me.
05-11-2018T22:55:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark said he‚Äôs stopping the tour after the leg he‚Äôs on now
05-11-2018T22:55:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And I don‚Äôt remember if they went to Canada or not
05-11-2018T22:55:56,Mippy,annd I'll get tickets...and possibly force my Mom to go with me...because I have no friends
05-11-2018T22:56:16,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what I did. Brought my friend with me
05-11-2018T22:56:42,Mippy,Eh? Future tour?

05-11-2018T22:57:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I went to the Atlanta show last October
05-11-2018T23:00:53,Mippy,Your poor friend. What tourture.
05-11-2018T23:01:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Now keep in mind he still has that big honkin van. He may do a rando travel up there for a video
05-11-2018T23:02:06,SpazztasticKiwi,At this point I don‚Äôt see anything he could do now that would surprise me
05-11-2018T23:02:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless he came down to Alabama. In that case my only question would be ‚Äúwhat the hell for?‚Äù
