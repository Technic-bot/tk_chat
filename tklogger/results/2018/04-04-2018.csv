04-04-2018T00:10:51,Bigboi182,Of all the things that had to break...
04-04-2018T00:17:25,Vatruvius,At least I still have power and internet.
04-04-2018T00:19:58,Bigboi182,True.
04-04-2018T00:20:16,Bigboi182,"See, that's it! Look on the positive side."
04-04-2018T00:23:54,TheBeckoner,Download some shower
04-04-2018T00:26:54,Vatruvius,Don't think that will work the way I want it to.
04-04-2018T00:28:56,Bigboi182,Yeah.
04-04-2018T00:29:20,Bigboi182,I'mma get some shuteye.
04-04-2018T00:29:25,Bigboi182,See ya!
04-04-2018T00:29:47,Bigboi182,Hope your shower gets fixed Vat.
04-04-2018T00:29:56,Bigboi182,You need the hot shower.
04-04-2018T00:32:05,Vatruvius,Byr Bigboi!
04-04-2018T00:32:13,Vatruvius,Bye*
04-04-2018T03:21:44,SpazztasticKiwi,My flight’s in two hours and ten minutes
04-04-2018T10:06:43,NightMeaty22,good morning
04-04-2018T10:23:55,TrexM,morning
04-04-2018T10:26:40,Vatruvius,It is definitely not a good morning. :ptv-unimpressed:
04-04-2018T10:44:35,Vatruvius,Construction traffic. :ptv-sad:
04-04-2018T10:50:41,Vatruvius,:ptv-whiny:
04-04-2018T11:21:22,Bigboi182,Morning chaps!
04-04-2018T11:21:39,Bigboi182,"Stuck in traffic, eh Vat?"
04-04-2018T11:21:52,Bigboi182,You've had a bad 2 days...
04-04-2018T11:28:16,Vatruvius,And I am late to class...gotta run.
04-04-2018T11:37:33,Bigboi182,"OK, get to class."
04-04-2018T12:54:30,Vatruvius,And class is over. Tge week is done and now I can drive home and relax. :ptv-hearts:
04-04-2018T12:54:38,Vatruvius,The*
04-04-2018T12:59:14,Bigboi182,Yay!
04-04-2018T12:59:23,Bigboi182,But still no water...
04-04-2018T13:07:53,Vatruvius,We had a guy fill up our 2500 gallon tank so I will have water for a few days. Enough to get the well pump replaced.
04-04-2018T13:22:29,Bigboi182,That'll do for now then...
04-04-2018T14:12:16,Vatruvius,My dad called the well service that drilled the well in the first place and are pulling up the 800 foot line as I type. Not only do we have water but out well should be opperational by the end of the day.
04-04-2018T14:13:57,Vatruvius,"And on the drive back home I had a really cool vision of a game I have been wanted to create for over a year now...time to bust out my dusty mechanical pencils, put on some music, and go through about 20 pieces of paper trying to draw it."
04-04-2018T15:13:50,Bigboi182,I've had those visions all my life bro...
04-04-2018T15:14:06,Bigboi182,Flashback to the failed uses of RPG Maker...
04-04-2018T15:27:59,Bigboi182,Hello Torque~
04-04-2018T15:29:51,Vatruvius,And I am shit at drawing what is in my head...why can't there just be a machine that sees what your vision is and make it. That and...I am a very inexperienced drawer.
04-04-2018T15:59:23,Vatruvius,I will give drawing my vision another chance later...I got a rough sketch that reminds me of what the vision was but it will take some time to get it to look like what I want it to.
04-04-2018T16:04:42,Bigboi182,I have ALWAYS had that disappointment. I am currently making my comic called 'Roomies' and it is definitely NOT what I wanted it to look like.
04-04-2018T16:05:03,Bigboi182,I've tried to draw TK fanart and it looks awful.
04-04-2018T16:05:38,Bigboi182,See? https://carlitob1010.deviantart.com/art/20180318-191757-736160230
04-04-2018T16:06:02,Bigboi182,It's pretty bad...
04-04-2018T16:06:34,Bigboi182,So don't beat up yourself... There are people who are MUCH worse off...
04-04-2018T16:08:27,Vatruvius,Future Yoda Keith...:ptv-hearts: I understand though...I actually am pretty good at drawing it just takes ma a really long time to complete something.
04-04-2018T16:08:39,Vatruvius,me*
04-04-2018T16:24:03,Bigboi182,There you go! that's much better.
04-04-2018T16:24:16,Bigboi182,I TOLD you my drawing would suck...
04-04-2018T16:27:04,Bgrmystr2,"You should probably focus on speed before quality, Vatru"
04-04-2018T16:27:39,Bgrmystr2,Quality will improve regardless
04-04-2018T16:28:17,Bgrmystr2,"but the faster you work on stuff, the faster you finish, and the faster your quality improves"
04-04-2018T16:36:03,Bigboi182,I have more pictures of my comic if you want to see it...
04-04-2018T16:36:15,Bigboi182,Only IF you want to...
04-04-2018T16:37:42,Bigboi182,"Be warned, some of the pictures are REALLY blurry..."
04-04-2018T16:40:22,WIPKING,Lol watching goonies and chunk just smashed his pizza and coke amd the glass.

04-04-2018T16:42:06,Bigboi182,What?
04-04-2018T16:42:55,Bigboi182,"You really do watch some random stuff, not gonna lie..."
04-04-2018T16:46:21,WIPKING,The Goonies isnt random
04-04-2018T16:47:06,WIPKING,Its a 80s movies
04-04-2018T16:52:07,Bigboi182,I see...
04-04-2018T17:20:02,Vatruvius,I am not much of an artist Bgr...this is one of the first times I ever thought about using my drawing skills for anything in the last two years since I had to draw for courses I took in college. I only too the one course and it just was not for me.
04-04-2018T17:25:35,Bgrmystr2,Not all classes will be ideal for everyone
04-04-2018T17:25:48,Bgrmystr2,but that doesn't mean what they would be for isn't right for you
04-04-2018T17:32:14,Vatruvius,What? That statement confuses me Bgr. What I know is that I am not a creative/art person. I do not doodle or anything...I have a creative mind for content like D&D and the world of this video game I had a vision of.
04-04-2018T17:33:02,Vatruvius,When it comes to drawing I do have skills do to how my mind works but I have very little experience and it certainly would not be my career. Maybe a hobby later on...but not my career.
04-04-2018T17:33:08,Vatruvius,due*
04-04-2018T17:33:38,Bgrmystr2,"If it confuses you, stop thinking about it so hard. :P You taking one course that didn't suit you doesn't mean that career isn't for you. It's just the class wasn't for you. There's a difference."
04-04-2018T17:33:43,Bgrmystr2,Not all classes are made equal
04-04-2018T17:34:22,Bgrmystr2,being an artist can mean many different things. And it's not like being an artist wouldn't help you making games like D&D and such.
04-04-2018T17:34:35,Vatruvius,I know that...that particular class was the beginning to my Industrial Design major.
04-04-2018T17:35:32,Vatruvius,Now I am leaning towards programming but I will probably lead a team of people to bring this game I am thinking of to life. I like to create...but art is just not the most efficient method for me to do that.

04-04-2018T18:46:01,Vatruvius,Tom is here too...hi!
04-04-2018T18:47:37,WIPKING,"I wish i could support twokinds but because im pore i ........ well its not that i cant support, its that i have to ask my parents before i spend money, and asking parents for money to support a furry web comic is a bit embarassing."
04-04-2018T18:48:27,Vatruvius,My parents cannot believe I would donate money to anyone...they really do not care who. I think donating money to people really is a new generation thing.
04-04-2018T18:48:28,WIPKING,"But i can say thanks to tom and give him a support that is worth more than any amount of money,"
04-04-2018T18:48:52,w0lfmare,Just tell them it's a manga
04-04-2018T18:48:56,w0lfmare,Problem solved
04-04-2018T18:49:07,Vatruvius,Nah...just the money WIP...nothing else.

04-04-2018T18:50:19,WIPKING,The problem with saying its manga is that they understand it more than i do. But i guess its worthnthe shot
04-04-2018T18:50:31,WIPKING,Hey vat.....
04-04-2018T18:51:32,WIPKING,@Vatruvius you know that World at War Zombies video that Vanoss created with Wildcat and at the end of the video he tells us the name of a character in a play he created

04-04-2018T19:04:56,SpazztasticKiwi,But Boston’s nice
04-04-2018T19:06:09,Bgrmystr2,Yeah Boston is cool
04-04-2018T19:06:11,Bgrmystr2,been there before
04-04-2018T19:06:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Isao Takahata passed away today though
04-04-2018T19:10:15,Vatruvius,Who?
04-04-2018T19:13:38,WIPKING,Gunna be honest im expecting a stream...
04-04-2018T19:14:01,Vatruvius,You should settle on a name color.
04-04-2018T19:16:34,WIPKING,I did
04-04-2018T19:16:36,WIPKING,This red
04-04-2018T19:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Isao was the co-creator/director of My Neighbor Tortoro

04-04-2018T19:19:10,WIPKING,Turn off auto correct then
04-04-2018T19:19:34,Vatruvius,Cannot say I am familiar with that. Actually...I am not familiar with most things brought up in this chat.
04-04-2018T19:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s more useful than aggravating
04-04-2018T19:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw it on Tom’s profile on TK’s site. It’s a sweet movie
04-04-2018T19:20:35,Vatruvius,This is true Kiwi...more useful than aggravating.
04-04-2018T19:20:36,WIPKING,Whats it about
04-04-2018T19:21:22,Vatruvius,Wikipedia said it had to do with two daughters of a professor talking to wood spirits in some part of Japan.
04-04-2018T19:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,You’ll have to look up the movie’s description. I’m no good with that
04-04-2018T19:22:07,SpazztasticKiwi,But I really liked it. My friend and I just found out when we got back to the hotel
04-04-2018T19:22:45,Vatruvius,When will that be?
04-04-2018T19:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Getting back to the hotel? We’re back already
04-04-2018T19:23:55,Vatruvius,But you just said you and your friend just found out when you would get back?
04-04-2018T19:24:43,TomFurson,Do you guys live here?
04-04-2018T19:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"We found out when we got back to the hotel - in other words, sat down and checked our phones"
04-04-2018T19:24:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
04-04-2018T19:24:58,Vatruvius,Not...Bgr does. He often let's us stay over though.
04-04-2018T19:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,No we’re visiting Boston
04-04-2018T19:25:54,WIPKING,Lol

04-04-2018T19:27:56,Bgrmystr2,Is that good news? :thinking:
04-04-2018T19:28:00,Vatruvius,You cannot stream at your dad's house?
04-04-2018T19:28:10,Vatruvius,Or watch streams rather?
04-04-2018T19:28:27,WIPKING,Yes well im ground cause of grades
04-04-2018T19:28:34,WIPKING,My mom is much nicer
04-04-2018T19:28:45,WIPKING,Bgr sorry its good news for me
04-04-2018T19:28:54,Bgrmystr2,"Well that's what matters, right?"
04-04-2018T19:29:00,Bgrmystr2,good news for you
04-04-2018T19:29:05,WIPKING,Not you
04-04-2018T19:29:22,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it doesn't affect me any, so it's not really good or bad"
04-04-2018T19:29:29,Bgrmystr2,:u
04-04-2018T19:29:54,WIPKING,Just news as oogway says in kungfoo panda
04-04-2018T19:30:06,Bgrmystr2,I'd agree with that.
04-04-2018T19:30:19,Vatruvius,To be honest...getting good grades is actually really important and you should focus on school before watching streams. iliar uploads them on youtube so you can always watch them when you have finished your studies.
04-04-2018T19:30:34,Vatruvius,You will regret not getting good grades later in life...trust me.
04-04-2018T19:31:08,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I would agree w/ that to a point Vatru
04-04-2018T19:31:40,Bgrmystr2,I guess it does matter till near the  end of highschool when you kinda know what you're good at and what you wanna do
04-04-2018T19:31:56,Bgrmystr2,and then what you want to do and what you actually do end up being different
04-04-2018T19:32:15,Bgrmystr2,"but of course, none of that really is affected by the grades you make in school, you just need to learn basic stuff"
04-04-2018T19:33:01,Bgrmystr2,a lot of it helps though
04-04-2018T19:33:10,Bgrmystr2,so it's better than not knowing.
04-04-2018T19:34:40,Vatruvius,"The grades you get affects your chances of getting into colleges. Will you get into the college meant for you and your interests or into a basic college that will get some BS degree, may not be the one you want."
04-04-2018T19:35:07,Vatruvius,It really does matter if you plan on going to college. If not...it is good to exercise self discipline.
04-04-2018T19:35:58,TomFurson,OOOo College talk
04-04-2018T19:36:00,Bgrmystr2,"Most colleges are going to be trash though. Some people need it, some people don't, but for the most part it won't teach you what you really need to know cuz you can't learn that in a school setting."
04-04-2018T19:36:31,Bgrmystr2,best way of learning has always been on the field experiencing whatever it is firsthand.
04-04-2018T19:36:49,TomFurson,I mostly agree
04-04-2018T19:36:58,Vatruvius,Yes...but you cannot not get a good job or even a good paying one without a BS degree.
04-04-2018T19:37:10,Bgrmystr2,"fastest way to make mistakes, fastest way to realize they were mistakes, and fastest way to not make the same mistakes again"
04-04-2018T19:37:44,Bgrmystr2,"That may be true for the stereotypical job, Vatru, but there are exceptions across the board for most things"
04-04-2018T19:38:36,Bgrmystr2,"the only reason they look for college degrees is because they look for people with knowledge. If you can prove you've already got knowledge that surpasses a college degree, then it's not a difficult choice for them"
04-04-2018T19:40:14,Vatruvius,Actually...I have done a great deal of research on this subject Bgr. From the 12+ speeches I have gone to with employers along with the research I have done...if you do not have a degree and someone else does...your resume will not even be looked at.
04-04-2018T19:41:01,Vatruvius,In this world...for my generation...degrees are very important. If you do get hired without a degree...you will payed less by a substantial amount legally. Nothing you can do about it.
04-04-2018T19:42:00,Vatruvius,"That is if you get hired at all. Some fields care less about degrees because they could really use new people in the field, I get that, but if you want anything above a minimum wage job you need a degree of some kind."
04-04-2018T19:42:38,Bgrmystr2,"Research is nice, but I've already seen what happens in the field. Like I said, It's true for most stereotypical jobs, but there are exceptions for most things."
04-04-2018T19:42:42,Vatruvius,You are lucky Bgr because you have a work history...I would be hard pressed to find any job without a degree.
04-04-2018T19:42:50,Dadrobit,Unpopular opinion: Don't waste time with a 4 year BA. Go get certifications in somehting like welding at a trade school instead.
04-04-2018T19:43:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,welding pays super well
04-04-2018T19:43:11,Dadrobit,something*
04-04-2018T19:43:44,Vatruvius,Certificates are good...I have some of those offered at my community college I am attending right now.
04-04-2018T19:43:47,Bgrmystr2,"When I grow up, I'm gonna be a professional anime watcher :V"
04-04-2018T19:43:52,Bgrmystr2,or whatever.
04-04-2018T19:43:56,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
04-04-2018T19:44:37,Dadrobit,"Pops teaches it at high scool and college, makes his more dedicated kids get at least basic certifications in high school. They get out into the real world with $40+ an hour jobs."
04-04-2018T19:45:25,Dadrobit,He's a super propponent of not going for BA's in general.
04-04-2018T19:45:49,Dadrobit,"Unless you intend on going for a Masters, you're just another brick in the wall."
04-04-2018T19:46:03,Vatruvius,That is my point though...without a degree of some kind or a certificate at the very least...you will never get a job paying over $20 an hour unless you build up a decade of job history.
04-04-2018T19:46:47,Dadrobit,"It's of course better than just not having a post basic degree, but if you're going to spend time/money after high school, spend it on getting certified in a specific vocation."
04-04-2018T19:47:18,Bgrmystr2,"You do realize, Vatru, that most people who finish college still end up working their way up from the bottom of the totem poll"
04-04-2018T19:47:46,Bgrmystr2,"college degrees and all that stuff, do not ever guarentee a well-paying job"
04-04-2018T19:51:25,Dadrobit,"They do, overall and in general, provide a higher wages throughout your life and have a better guarantee of having a full time job."
04-04-2018T19:51:35,Dadrobit,https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=77
04-04-2018T19:52:23,Dadrobit,provide hihger*
04-04-2018T19:52:27,Dadrobit,higher*
04-04-2018T19:52:52,Bgrmystr2,"yeah higher, by a bit"
04-04-2018T19:53:01,Bgrmystr2,interesting how the lines are so close though
04-04-2018T19:53:39,Dadrobit,20% more isn't exactly close.
04-04-2018T19:54:19,WIPKING,Meh brain hurts from you guys
04-04-2018T19:54:38,Dadrobit,Not to mention the $19.5k a year that the BA earn over HS on average.
04-04-2018T19:54:57,Dadrobit,64% higher yo.
04-04-2018T19:55:40,Dadrobit,"Sure, higher education isn't for everyone, but on average, it is absolutey beneficial."
04-04-2018T19:55:53,Bgrmystr2,highschool and/or GED is less than 10% from the college degrees for the most part
04-04-2018T19:57:16,Bgrmystr2,"probably around 14% at the highest difference, vs I'd say 6 or 7% at it's closest"
04-04-2018T19:57:27,Bgrmystr2,it's only a few years of data though so
04-04-2018T19:57:29,Dadrobit,"Ah, indeed, I was looking at the hard red line."
04-04-2018T19:57:54,Dadrobit,It's the most recent data and it nearly covers an entire generation....
04-04-2018T19:57:57,Bgrmystr2,but yeah college is definitely consistantly higher
04-04-2018T19:58:17,Bgrmystr2,obv dropping out of high school is not great
04-04-2018T20:56:14,Vatruvius,And I am back.
04-04-2018T21:01:42,TorqueEmUp,"I mean as long as you get your GED, it doesn't really matter"
04-04-2018T21:09:22,WIPKING,Why is tom here
04-04-2018T21:09:46,Bgrmystr2,It's his stream p[age
04-04-2018T21:09:50,WIPKING,Hes not going to start streaming at 10 is he
04-04-2018T21:09:51,Bgrmystr2,why would he not be here?
04-04-2018T21:10:04,WIPKING,Or 11
04-04-2018T21:13:07,Vatruvius,Tom lucks in the chat to watch us...or he just likes to read what we talk about when he can.
04-04-2018T21:13:25,WIPKING,"@TorqueEmUp  you never was talking about college so you should have just left out ""i mean"""
04-04-2018T21:13:26,Vatruvius,I think it is the latter more than the formor.
04-04-2018T21:13:54,Vatruvius,You get your GED in college WIP
04-04-2018T21:14:20,WIPKING,He was never in the conbersation so why did he say i mean
04-04-2018T21:14:21,Bgrmystr2,No you don't Vatru
04-04-2018T21:15:25,Bgrmystr2,GED is a test that is equivilant to a high school diploma.
04-04-2018T21:15:41,Bgrmystr2,"You can probably get it at a college, but you don't get it going to college"
04-04-2018T21:15:51,Vatruvius,Your General Education Degree...like an Associates Degree?
04-04-2018T21:15:57,Bgrmystr2,no
04-04-2018T21:16:02,Bgrmystr2,That's different
04-04-2018T21:16:07,Bgrmystr2,a GED is not a college degree
04-04-2018T21:16:11,Bgrmystr2,it's a high school degree
04-04-2018T21:16:31,Vatruvius,I thought he was talking about finishing your general ed.
04-04-2018T21:16:34,Bgrmystr2,"instead of gratuating high school, some people get a GED"
04-04-2018T21:16:36,TomFurson,You are still talking about education?
04-04-2018T21:17:16,Vatruvius,It was over a long time ago then WIP brought it back up.
04-04-2018T21:17:22,Bgrmystr2,and yeah Torque was talking about finishing education. xD
04-04-2018T21:17:24,Vatruvius,Hmm...
04-04-2018T21:17:34,Bgrmystr2,"All he's saying is that if you don't finish high school, then get your GED"
04-04-2018T21:17:36,Bgrmystr2,and it's fine
04-04-2018T21:17:48,TomFurson,you can get a GED.
04-04-2018T21:17:48,Bgrmystr2,it's an equivilant degree in all aspects
04-04-2018T21:18:13,TomFurson,You have to pass a test if I am correct
04-04-2018T21:18:17,Bgrmystr2,Yes you do
04-04-2018T21:18:29,Bgrmystr2,"I had to get one, so I'd know."
04-04-2018T21:18:44,Bgrmystr2,"Unfortunately, not something I chose willingly."
04-04-2018T21:18:46,TomFurson,Ya I went to community college for High School and got my AA
04-04-2018T21:19:11,Vatruvius,Okay...in that case I say you should get something better than a diploma/GED but I know it is not for everyone.
04-04-2018T21:19:39,Vatruvius,Same TomFurson...got my Natural Science AS
04-04-2018T21:19:48,TomFurson,It was a pain. Also it depends on the state you live in
04-04-2018T21:20:26,TomFurson,"I almost went with an AS, but I would have had to say at CC longer"
04-04-2018T21:21:05,Vatruvius,Yes...very hard...but I learned a lot and I am significantly more mature than the majority of incoming college students...makes me feel like I went back to high school.
04-04-2018T21:21:17,Bgrmystr2,The difference for a Bachelor's and a Masters or higher is not that much higher than simply high school / GED education.
04-04-2018T21:21:25,Bgrmystr2,it's how you use it
04-04-2018T21:21:55,TomFurson,I know right. I hate first year college students
04-04-2018T21:22:12,TomFurson,I was in a drom full of them. It was the worst
04-04-2018T21:22:14,Vatruvius,Well...a diploma and GED is your general ed at the high school level while a Bachelors and Masters has a focus in a particular field. So not really that same...
04-04-2018T21:22:56,Bgrmystr2,noone said they were the same xD
04-04-2018T21:23:12,TomFurson,Also you can only get Bachelors  and Masters  at 4 year universities
04-04-2018T21:23:33,TomFurson,If you get an AA or AS the time is generally cut in half
04-04-2018T21:23:34,Vatruvius,You just said there were not that much of a difference Bgr.
04-04-2018T21:23:55,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, I did. Did you not click the link that dadrobit sent earlier?"
04-04-2018T21:24:29,Vatruvius,Yes...unless the degree you are trying to get follows a linear path of class to class so it does not cut time. Depends on the degree. But...it does mean when you try to get your degree you can just focus on your degree classes.
04-04-2018T21:25:01,Bgrmystr2,"then you'd know what I was referring to if you clicked it, cuz there's a very small percentage of difference."
04-04-2018T21:25:19,Bgrmystr2,considering the massive expenditure of money and time between the two
04-04-2018T21:25:39,Vatruvius,I know what the link was about. And...the difference might not seem like a lot but it is actually quite a bit in the real world. On average...someone with a degree earns $1M more in their lifetime compared to someone without a degree. That is a lot of $.
04-04-2018T21:26:02,Bgrmystr2,the link has nothing to do with amount of money earned
04-04-2018T21:26:07,TomFurson,But that is on a life time
04-04-2018T21:26:26,Bgrmystr2,and yeah that's a lifetime. that's not a lot realistically speaking
04-04-2018T21:27:50,Bgrmystr2,The difference of $1m is about $8 an hr for 60 year worklife
04-04-2018T21:28:11,Vatruvius,You have your opinion and I have mine Bgr. Though a higher education is not for everyone there is definitely a difference and it is noticeably difference. That biggest thing that make those difference not seem like a lot is the improvement to lifestyle.
04-04-2018T21:28:28,Bgrmystr2,and the differences some people make surpass $20-30 an hour difference
04-04-2018T21:28:52,Bgrmystr2,"This is not about opinions, Vatru. This is just about you not realizing what I'm talking about, so I'm explaining it."
04-04-2018T21:29:33,Bgrmystr2,"But if you wanna write it off as ""opinion"" then that's on you."
04-04-2018T21:29:42,Bgrmystr2,Least I tried. :
04-04-2018T21:29:43,Bgrmystr2,:v
04-04-2018T21:32:43,Vatruvius,No...it is an opinion Bgr. You are older...you have years of job experience and are successful to your standers of success.
04-04-2018T21:33:09,Vatruvius,For my generation of people coming out of high school...get a job at all let alone one that allows you to pay all of your bills is nearly impossible without a degree. That is my generation's world.
04-04-2018T21:33:22,Bgrmystr2,I did not know that making a note of a website where some lines are closer than other lines is opinion.
04-04-2018T21:33:41,Bgrmystr2,:thinking::thumbsup:
04-04-2018T21:33:52,TorqueEmUp,I seem to be doing fine without only a high school diploma
04-04-2018T21:33:59,TorqueEmUp,with*
04-04-2018T21:34:07,Vatruvius,This is a matter of opinion. And I understand that education is not for everyone...I want to end the subject but since you think your opinion is fact I have to come in here say it is not. The world is changing...it it is hard to live at all with a degree.
04-04-2018T21:34:12,TorqueEmUp,"stupid phone, tried to type too quick."
04-04-2018T21:35:29,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru, if you're going to actually accuse me of something I didn't do, at least do a better job of reading what I wrote and putting two and two together? :/"
04-04-2018T21:35:52,Bgrmystr2,cuz what you're saying and what I'm saying are two different conversations
04-04-2018T21:36:03,Bgrmystr2,It's like I'm talkin to the wall..
04-04-2018T21:36:27,Vatruvius,You literally said that this is not opinion but me seeing how it actually is and I am here to tell you that I have spent my entire life navigating what life is like for my generation.
04-04-2018T21:36:41,Bgrmystr2,"I'm doin alright as well, Torque, but it's not easy sometimes"
04-04-2018T21:36:47,Vatruvius,Do not write off another persons experiences as nothing.
04-04-2018T21:36:55,TorqueEmUp,agreed bgr
04-04-2018T21:37:09,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru, did you bother to even try to realize what I was talking about when I said that it wasn't opinion."
04-04-2018T21:37:14,NightMeaty22,d's welcome to McDo
04-04-2018T21:37:26,TorqueEmUp,"I lost my security job, and not really want to get into that stressful field, I just been doing DoorDash"
04-04-2018T21:37:53,Bgrmystr2,that sucks :c
04-04-2018T21:37:54,TorqueEmUp,"work when I want, for how long I want (within reason)."
04-04-2018T21:38:04,Vatruvius,I was simply trying to enlighten to you what my life has been like. I will just come back later when our heads cool down.
04-04-2018T21:38:26,TorqueEmUp,"cost of living around here is quite low, so that helps."
04-04-2018T21:38:35,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru, you think I don't know what it's like to not have job cuz market is shit lol xD"
04-04-2018T21:39:17,TorqueEmUp,"agreed, I know countless people with degrees out of college that haven't even used those degrees."
04-04-2018T21:39:23,Bgrmystr2,All I was saying is that a highschool Diploma / GED is not too far behind a college degree in terms of amount of ppl getting full time jobs lol
04-04-2018T21:39:28,Bgrmystr2,and that's not opinion
04-04-2018T21:39:30,TorqueEmUp,because the job market blows chunks
04-04-2018T21:39:36,Bgrmystr2,it's from the fact page that dadrobit linked.
04-04-2018T21:40:00,TorqueEmUp,Not fond of going into debt for some extra education
04-04-2018T21:40:42,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I wish the subject ""howe 2 conversation"" was a high school class."
04-04-2018T21:41:14,TorqueEmUp,I probably wouldn't have paid attention if it was
04-04-2018T21:41:17,TorqueEmUp,:P
04-04-2018T21:41:28,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-04-2018T21:41:31,TorqueEmUp,I was one of THOSE kids in high school
04-04-2018T21:41:32,TorqueEmUp,I slept
04-04-2018T21:41:38,Bgrmystr2,That's just terrible tho Torque
04-04-2018T21:41:43,Bgrmystr2,the class would be easy
04-04-2018T21:41:43,TorqueEmUp,teachers hated me for that
04-04-2018T21:41:58,Bgrmystr2,it'd be 90% arguments and 10% understanding
04-04-2018T21:42:02,Bgrmystr2,the class would be hell
04-04-2018T21:42:05,TorqueEmUp,lol
04-04-2018T21:42:14,Bgrmystr2,"but at the end of the day, everyone would be a better person because of it"
04-04-2018T21:42:22,Bgrmystr2,"well, at the end of many days"
04-04-2018T21:42:24,TorqueEmUp,I might pay attention
04-04-2018T21:42:26,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-04-2018T21:42:41,TorqueEmUp,I only ever did anything in my extra curricular classes
04-04-2018T21:42:42,Bgrmystr2,there would be no subject other than talking to others haha
04-04-2018T21:44:25,TorqueEmUp,"If I wasn't interested, I didn't do it. lol"
04-04-2018T21:45:08,Bgrmystr2,bad kid is bad xD
04-04-2018T21:45:15,TorqueEmUp,"Like my Info Tech class. Did fantastic in everything, except when he started having us doing programming, and I was like. ""Fuck that"""
04-04-2018T21:46:01,TorqueEmUp,"Yep, a bad kid"
04-04-2018T21:46:26,TorqueEmUp,well
04-04-2018T21:46:29,TorqueEmUp,bad student
04-04-2018T21:46:31,TorqueEmUp,:P

04-04-2018T21:47:29,TorqueEmUp,I didn't get in trouble. (mostly)
04-04-2018T21:48:57,TorqueEmUp,Only times I got in trouble when I was trying to occupy my time with things other than schoolwork.
04-04-2018T21:49:09,TorqueEmUp,and I'd get smartmouthy
