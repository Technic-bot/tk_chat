01-11-2018T12:06:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Reminds me I had an odd nightmare last night. Some creepy ghost lady was haunting my house and she always showed up in the bathroom mirror
01-11-2018T12:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"So when she screamed, I screamed back. She left"
01-11-2018T12:07:13,CrRAR,"Hmm, your scream game too stronk."
01-11-2018T12:07:23,CrRAR,for mirror lady demon
01-11-2018T12:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt yell at me. I‚Äôm already dead - I‚Äôm sensitive‚Äù
01-11-2018T12:08:19,CrRAR,"Well, maybe she only makes appearances around Halloween."
01-11-2018T12:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúThen go haunt an abandoned shack and leave me be‚Äù
01-11-2018T12:08:51,CrRAR,Solution: Just move the mirror somewhere else.
01-11-2018T12:09:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs slightly odd why ghosts like shiny things and their own reflection
01-11-2018T12:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like if I looked half as bad as most demons got after death, I‚Äôd avoid seeing myself"
01-11-2018T12:11:22,CrRAR,"It's funny because vampires don't get reflections, but they're typically the most dapper of all ghouls."
01-11-2018T12:11:34,CrRAR,:thinking:
01-11-2018T12:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,They say in an emergency coconut milk can be used in a blood transfusion
01-11-2018T12:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,And so vegan vampires are born
01-11-2018T12:23:12,CrRAR,VEGAN and good looks? They'll be UNSTOPPABLE.
01-11-2018T12:23:53,CrRAR,"Though... there is THE MOST sunlight where coconuts are, it could actually cause them to go extinct."
01-11-2018T12:26:30,CrRAR,unless... SECRET UNDERGROUND COCONUT CARTEL!!!

01-11-2018T12:33:04,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre forgetting about sunscreen and umbrellas ‚òÇ
01-11-2018T12:33:44,CrRAR,Now just likely disguises.
01-11-2018T12:33:47,SpazztasticKiwi,And the fact coconuts and coconut milk is sold in the black hole that is Walmart
01-11-2018T12:33:52,CrRAR,lol
01-11-2018T12:34:27,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWow. Coconut milk. You must be so healthy!‚Äù
01-11-2018T12:34:45,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúYeah. Watching my blood pressure‚Äù
01-11-2018T12:42:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve recently been noticing real estate lately or all of a sudden there‚Äôs an unannounced exodus from my area
01-11-2018T12:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Few more places have popped up on my feed for sale
01-11-2018T12:44:33,CrRAR,"Tons of people are selling because of the market, lots of folks are older too so they could be downsizing and pocketing the extra dollars."
01-11-2018T12:45:00,CrRAR,They could also just have been vampires and are moving closer to the coconuts.
01-11-2018T12:46:00,Xexanoth,Vampires are controlling the Coconut Milk market
01-11-2018T12:46:09,Xexanoth,Wake up Sheeple
01-11-2018T12:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Vampires are a safe assumption. We do get a bit of sun
01-11-2018T12:54:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Though people flip when there‚Äôs so much as a snowflake
01-11-2018T12:56:49,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
01-11-2018T12:56:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe if new people don‚Äôt move in and people keep moving out it‚Äôll be calmer for those who remain
01-11-2018T12:58:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or we‚Äôll get people moving in that contribute to a bit of nice change, if not variety"
01-11-2018T12:59:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Like when Hiro moved his hibachi place into town üçú
01-11-2018T13:08:18,FennexTheFox,h-hewwo?!?
01-11-2018T13:11:27,Dadrobit,"How can coconuts be vegan? They have hair and produce their own milk, which defines them as a mammal. Therefore not vegan. A coconut transfusion would just deveganize them."
01-11-2018T13:13:15,Dadrobit,"Also, hello."
01-11-2018T13:13:50,CrRAR,"also, hello to you sir."
01-11-2018T13:17:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Categorizing things is flawed at best. It‚Äôs like saying a hairless biped is human, plucking a chicken, and saying ‚ÄúBehold, a man!‚Äù"
01-11-2018T13:18:43,Dadrobit,Quoth Diogenes.
01-11-2018T13:19:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if I‚Äôm on the internet too mt

01-11-2018T13:29:55,FennexTheFox,and the raine print <3 looks way better in person than online tbh

01-11-2018T13:35:53,FennexTheFox,"yeah, also the thickness is a nice touch :) glad i wont accidentally crease it"
01-11-2018T13:48:03,Twokinds,Yeah I tried to make sure the prints were high quality
01-11-2018T14:17:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Still might get it laminated
01-11-2018T14:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Cost like a dollar at the library or something
01-11-2018T14:24:22,Dadrobit,":/ Man, I was a day one pre-order, and it seems like I'm gonna be the last person to actually get it lol."

01-11-2018T20:10:37,Nekonny,city

01-11-2018T20:13:21,SageSaga,go into an anime studio and demand more catgirls in anime or else you wont leave
01-11-2018T20:13:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Might be cold when you go
01-11-2018T20:13:34,Nekonny,"leaving out of orlando, Cleveland and a handful of other places"

01-11-2018T20:32:38,SageSaga,stream times are based on the person streaming's time- clearly if you are in a different time zone it can be a different day and time from you
01-11-2018T20:32:54,desertfenek,i know
01-11-2018T20:33:07,Bgrmystr2,stream time is based on the Eastern time zone. It's still Friday.
01-11-2018T20:33:23,Nekonny,9pm
01-11-2018T20:33:23,Bgrmystr2,just.. move to Eastern time and you'll be good :v

01-11-2018T20:34:46,Ordithus,Enhance! :ptv-angry:
01-11-2018T20:35:17,ZRO4825,"While I agree with you, Tharkis, one must always make sure the titties are correct. Never downgrade a bigger lady, and never upgrade a smaller lady. The results are almost never a happy female. :joy:"
01-11-2018T20:35:23,Bgrmystr2,"If it's too small, make em bigger."
01-11-2018T20:35:25,Bgrmystr2,and yeah
01-11-2018T20:35:50,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. they're unhappy *regardless* but yknow.. they could be even morer unhappy.
01-11-2018T20:36:47,Bgrmystr2,also yeah I'd say those are much bigger than you drew them in the new image
01-11-2018T20:37:11,Tharkis,lol.  I had to re-do my character's refsheet
01-11-2018T20:37:12,ZRO4825,She has nice fluff-counter-balances
01-11-2018T20:37:21,Tharkis,because people kept drawing her with HUUUUGGGEEE.... tracts of land
01-11-2018T20:37:29,ZRO4825,lol Tharkis
01-11-2018T20:37:44,Tharkis,so now the new ref sheet makes it more obvious that she's NOT chesty =D
01-11-2018T20:38:02,ZRO4825,"Just don't make her flat, then she'll get called a trap all the time. :rofl:"
01-11-2018T20:38:14,Tharkis,"not flat either, i'll link it tot you in pm"
01-11-2018T20:38:14,Bgrmystr2,or maybe she could stay chesty and it's all good? :upside_down:
01-11-2018T20:38:17,Nekonny,"larger , but not by much"
01-11-2018T20:38:36,Ordithus,"Give her an iMew, all will be fine"

01-11-2018T21:40:56,ZRO4825,"And before someone suggests it, no, it's not the boobs not being out in the open either. :P"
01-11-2018T21:41:06,DailyXperts,what was that from
01-11-2018T21:41:09,Ordithus,That was my guess
01-11-2018T21:42:06,SageSaga,it is very Michelle
01-11-2018T21:44:34,HeresyArtStream,"Dammit. My room was too warm so I opened the window, but it's raining and the window is next to my bed so I had to shut it because it was getting everything wet. :cheresyartstream-adiramad:"

01-11-2018T21:45:30,Mihari,"Well if anything the eyes are a bit too far apart, but meh"
01-11-2018T21:45:33,Bgrmystr2,it's easy zro
01-11-2018T21:45:38,Bgrmystr2,just put your finger onto the screen
01-11-2018T21:45:41,Bgrmystr2,and boop her nose
01-11-2018T21:45:53,ZRO4825,"I tried that, there was minimal reaction. I was much disappointed. D:"
01-11-2018T21:45:54,Ordithus,Who else did you think she was?
01-11-2018T21:46:05,ZRO4825,That's the kicker Ord. I can't say because idk
01-11-2018T21:46:07,SageSaga,too far?
01-11-2018T21:46:08,Bgrmystr2,well.. at least you put your finger on it. lol
01-11-2018T21:46:12,SageSaga,really?
01-11-2018T21:46:17,DailyXperts,well i now have a very red finger
01-11-2018T21:46:42,Mihari,"As in away from the nose, it's just a tiny bit."
01-11-2018T21:46:45,unsteddyphoenix,Should there be an eye distance between each eye sage?
01-11-2018T21:46:45,DailyXperts,because i was stupid enough to put a weight on my table
01-11-2018T21:46:50,unsteddyphoenix,Is that what you were measuring?
01-11-2018T21:46:56,Mihari,Course the whole lack of an actual visual nose might be playing into that.
01-11-2018T21:46:58,Bgrmystr2,"I think so, phoenix"
01-11-2018T21:47:00,Bgrmystr2,there usually is.
01-11-2018T21:47:07,ZRO4825,Mihari has point there methinks.
01-11-2018T21:47:17,Bgrmystr2,well you can sorta see the tip of it
01-11-2018T21:47:25,ZRO4825,Maybe that's what's screwin with me. idk
01-11-2018T21:47:33,Ordithus,:nose:
01-11-2018T21:48:06,SageSaga,its exactly an eye length apart
01-11-2018T21:48:20,unsteddyphoenix,interesting
01-11-2018T21:48:38,Ordithus,"How do anime characters fit two eyes on their faces, then"
01-11-2018T21:48:38,Mihari,I like I said it was an observation based on looks alone and I guessed it was do to the absence of a totally visual nose.
01-11-2018T21:50:21,Ordithus,The detail of her nose does look better to me
01-11-2018T21:50:33,Ordithus,Than before
01-11-2018T21:50:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Do I see a little reni?

01-11-2018T22:13:05,Bgrmystr2,I see sage didn't go with the micro bikini or the sling :o
01-11-2018T22:13:24,ZRO4825,Sling bikinis really aren't that great imo.
01-11-2018T22:13:42,Bgrmystr2,they are saucy though
01-11-2018T22:13:45,ZRO4825,the real fun of bikinis is watching the ladies bounce around in'em. Can't do that in slings or else there's no more bikini in the way. :joy:
01-11-2018T22:14:02,Bgrmystr2,"haha well, I guess that's true, but.."
01-11-2018T22:14:09,Bgrmystr2,that could also be a good thing? :v
01-11-2018T22:14:12,Bgrmystr2,perspective and all that
01-11-2018T22:14:13,thestooge,I'd say slings add more bounce ;)
01-11-2018T22:14:22,ZRO4825,It *could* be. Except Sage doesn't do NSFW. :P

01-11-2018T22:14:30,Ordithus,Tell that to Patreon
01-11-2018T22:15:31,ZRO4825,"Right, Ord? lol"
01-11-2018T22:19:29,HeresyArtStream,Patreon has dumb rules sometimes.
01-11-2018T22:19:48,ZRO4825,They're gonna shoot themselves in the foot is what they're doin.
01-11-2018T22:20:07,ZRO4825,I know of an artist who's working on a Patreon alternative that doesn't give a flying rat's behind about NSFW content.

01-11-2018T22:21:23,Bgrmystr2,Sage have you come to terms with the idea that they will probably *never* give you a proper response?
01-11-2018T22:22:18,ZRO4825,That's kinda bullshit if they don't.
01-11-2018T22:23:03,ZRO4825,"If they can't be arsed to give him a proper response on why he's locked down, then methinks they should be UNlocking his account from the 18+."
01-11-2018T22:24:20,ZRO4825,But that's my thinking. Companies I've noticed rarely if ever seem to run off the same train of logic I adhere to. :c
01-11-2018T22:24:44,Bgrmystr2,"I agree, but what are we gonna do about it lol"
