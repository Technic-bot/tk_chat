08-07-2018T05:57:43,Bgrmystr2,lolo
08-07-2018T08:40:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It didn’t end in physical or mental harm to anyone or anything. So that’s a plus
08-07-2018T08:40:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably confused some people though

08-07-2018T11:37:14,JamesBSquirrel3,Really.
08-07-2018T11:39:00,JamesBSquirrel3,Well its good to be back - but take it easy as usual. For me it couldn't gone following and overheat as heatwaves.
08-07-2018T11:42:09,Twokinds,"It was hot outside, but the convention was kept cold"
08-07-2018T11:42:44,Twokinds,Mostly for the sake of all the suiters. I don't envy them trying to walk around outside. :P
08-07-2018T11:44:27,JamesBSquirrel3,"Ah-ha I see your keep cool, nice. Hope you relax for a while."
08-07-2018T11:46:24,JamesBSquirrel3,"Anyway I was thinking yesterday about Sketch; can you draw sometimes about 'TwoKinds Concert', not LIVE music - I mean a drawing Concert plan! That will be something any ideas to cheer on. I wasn't sure while you on a list of TKPolls at a moment, y'know."
08-07-2018T11:54:49,JamesBSquirrel3,But you can think about anytime soon if it is your wish?
08-07-2018T11:55:29,JamesBSquirrel3,(about *it anytime)
08-07-2018T11:56:49,JamesBSquirrel3,"So I'll see you later on, take care Tom! Chao brb lol"

08-07-2018T12:21:16,Mippy,Yay! Work is being nice to me. I may actually be able to catch week day streams this week.
08-07-2018T12:22:39,TheGamePlayer,I see people are but I'm just concerned that if I do without asking it will result in terrible consequences
08-07-2018T12:23:07,TheGamePlayer,Cool Mippy
08-07-2018T12:24:43,Twokinds,I don't think Tom will mind
08-07-2018T12:25:04,Xexanoth,"As long as exhaustion is your only problem, cause con flu sucks"
08-07-2018T12:25:07,TheGamePlayer,Ok thanks Tom lol
08-07-2018T12:26:14,Mippy,Was gonna day that I swear Tom said we can use his stuff but someone beat me to it.

08-07-2018T12:32:00,Xexanoth,"prety sure it's picarto sucks on iOS, unless you're on a normal Windows WebBrowser picarto isn't doing so hot"
08-07-2018T12:32:21,TheGamePlayer,Ya picarto on iOS
08-07-2018T12:32:29,TheGamePlayer,I mixed it up
08-07-2018T12:39:54,TheGamePlayer,ok so it shows that my profile pic is changed on PC but not on my phone...
08-07-2018T12:42:30,Xexanoth,probably need to restart your phone browser
08-07-2018T12:57:30,SpazztasticKiwi,You have to be a special kind of person to take up 6 front parking spots at Walmart
08-07-2018T13:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,In other news my friend texted me this morning and told me Tom was at Antrocon
08-07-2018T13:31:55,Twokinds,Yep
08-07-2018T13:31:57,Twokinds,Just got back'
08-07-2018T13:32:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone should’ve told me
08-07-2018T13:33:03,SpazztasticKiwi,(Do note that I’m being slightly sarcastic )
08-07-2018T13:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,She evidently didn’t know you do commissions but she did say it was good you went. She’s more involved in that community than me and she says you’re pretty popular
08-07-2018T14:12:59,Twokinds,lol
08-07-2018T14:13:12,Twokinds,I unfortunately wasn't able to do a lot of sketches during the con
08-07-2018T14:13:40,Twokinds,I was pretty much completely booked by the second hour. It was crazy
08-07-2018T14:18:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah we heard
08-07-2018T14:19:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m currently being mobbed by my own fan club
08-07-2018T14:21:05,TheGamePlayer,Is that good?
08-07-2018T14:21:57,Xexanoth,that sounds...exhausting
08-07-2018T14:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it’s a cat and I’m a pretty big cat person so yeah
08-07-2018T14:23:22,TheGamePlayer,Well I'm currently eating breakfast at 2:22 pm
08-07-2018T14:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,If I wasn’t at work that’d be what I’d be doing instead
08-07-2018T14:24:38,TheGamePlayer,Lol
08-07-2018T14:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But i was up early so it’s lunch

08-07-2018T14:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,When I actually get up and make it that is
08-07-2018T14:26:09,TheGamePlayer,Lol
08-07-2018T14:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I tickle the tummy. Bagheera no like
08-07-2018T14:27:36,Xexanoth,scratch ears instead
08-07-2018T14:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,He wants treats
08-07-2018T14:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But he no need treats
08-07-2018T14:29:58,SpazztasticKiwi,He gets treats after I give him his medicine
08-07-2018T14:35:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Or when he does something cute
08-07-2018T14:36:31,Xexanoth,"but as a cat, doesn't he do cute things all the time?"
08-07-2018T14:38:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Well knocking over stuff isn’t cute
08-07-2018T14:39:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Or being a pest to his sister
08-07-2018T14:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I now have chili
08-07-2018T14:50:16,Xexanoth,Bon Appetit

08-07-2018T14:52:02,Bgrmystr2,"also, how is someone more involved in the community but not know tom does commissions at cons? That's like a known thing"
08-07-2018T14:56:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Not this community specifically
08-07-2018T14:56:39,SpazztasticKiwi,The fur stuff
08-07-2018T14:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Anthro community

08-07-2018T15:05:11,Bgrmystr2,"maybe not, tom said he needs a day to recover from the con"
08-07-2018T15:05:42,RimaDraws,yea road trip is tiring
08-07-2018T15:06:24,RimaDraws,he needs the break :)
08-07-2018T15:29:00,Xexanoth,i would need a break just from being around lots of people for several days
08-07-2018T15:30:52,JamesBSquirrel3,"We don't know now at an moments, its happening now or he say tomorrow? So that just a guess, honest."
08-07-2018T15:33:23,JamesBSquirrel3,"After all; we all we're 5th + 8th July of events as its stands, so exhuasted ways time."
08-07-2018T15:38:26,Bgrmystr2,"he didn't say anything, James"
08-07-2018T15:38:33,Bgrmystr2,"if it happens, it happens"
08-07-2018T15:38:48,Bgrmystr2,stop thinking so hard about it. :P
08-07-2018T15:42:04,JamesBSquirrel3,"I know, we all are.:slight_smile:"
08-07-2018T15:42:59,Xexanoth,"he did say he was gonna take a break, thats usually a pretty clear statement"
08-07-2018T15:44:31,Uluri,^_^
08-07-2018T16:06:49,Bgrmystr2,"naw james, I believe it's just you. :u"
08-07-2018T16:07:18,Bgrmystr2,"he was talking about after today, xex"
08-07-2018T19:03:31,Dadrobit,And the transmission was shot as well iirc. No first gear.
08-07-2018T19:03:36,TorqueEmUp,And they wonder why Americans soured at the idea of the Diesel engine in passenger cars.
08-07-2018T19:04:06,Dadrobit,It was the epitome of a broke teenager's first car
08-07-2018T19:04:50,TorqueEmUp,I have a Festiva. So I know that all too well. Was still a vastly better car than my newer 98 Monte Carlo.
08-07-2018T19:05:03,Dadrobit,"And yeah, it was a pita to work on. S'why I never got around to converting it."
08-07-2018T19:05:20,TorqueEmUp,"I sold the Monte to my roommate, and the Festiva kept have the passenge side axle pop out, and that prompted me to go out and get the 08 Focus."
08-07-2018T19:05:43,Dadrobit,Jesus lol
08-07-2018T19:06:06,TorqueEmUp,then just before AC the fuel pump died in the Monte.
08-07-2018T19:06:16,Dadrobit,Have an SES ZX3. Very fun little hatch
08-07-2018T19:06:47,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, mines a 08 SES with the PZEV package. But still has the 5-speed."
08-07-2018T19:07:08,TorqueEmUp,I eventually plan to remove all the PZEV nonsense
08-07-2018T19:07:27,TorqueEmUp,I do know I've got to get rid of that piece of shit lifetime airfilter garbage.
08-07-2018T19:07:32,Dadrobit,I ~believe~ mine's an 06. But don't quote me on that.
08-07-2018T19:07:33,RimaDraws,hi guys
08-07-2018T19:07:37,Dadrobit,o/ Rima
08-07-2018T19:07:42,RimaDraws,sup
08-07-2018T19:07:48,TorqueEmUp,Throttle response is garbage since it has 129k miles on that lifetime air filter.
08-07-2018T19:07:59,TorqueEmUp,"""lifetime"""
08-07-2018T19:08:09,Dadrobit,"You heard that they're discontinuing, like, all of the Ford model cars bar the Mustang?"
08-07-2018T19:08:20,TorqueEmUp,"Yup, sounds like a boneheaded move to me."
08-07-2018T19:08:23,Dadrobit,"Oh, yeah, screw that nonsense. Have that myself."
08-07-2018T19:09:00,Dadrobit,"Lifetime of the car? Either they have a shitload of confidence in the filter, or they're lacking a shitload of confidence in the car."
08-07-2018T19:09:07,TorqueEmUp,And of course they jammed it in the wheel well.
08-07-2018T19:09:29,TorqueEmUp,"So you have to remove the wheel, and inner fender liner to get to it."
08-07-2018T19:09:52,TorqueEmUp,But there are replacement airboxs you can get that let you switch to a replaceable filter.
08-07-2018T19:10:07,TorqueEmUp,so you can just bin that lifetime garbage.
08-07-2018T19:10:30,Dadrobit,"Same, I remember when I got the car and went to try and change the air filter, because of course you do that to any used car you buy, and I saw the ""instructions"". I legit thought I was in the twilight zone."
08-07-2018T19:12:27,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I am just going to get in there remove it, and aparently you can just stick a washable cone filter in its place with some intake adapter."
08-07-2018T19:48:12,QuinnAuer,Heya
08-07-2018T19:48:14,TorqueEmUp,"Well, going to go get a bite to eat, and then go see Antman 2"
08-07-2018T19:48:24,QuinnAuer,Take care?
08-07-2018T19:48:24,RimaDraws,i want to see that movie
08-07-2018T19:48:34,QuinnAuer,So I heard Tom survived AC as well
08-07-2018T19:49:14,TorqueEmUp,gah

08-07-2018T20:24:27,unsteddyphoenix,i'll take that under consideration
08-07-2018T20:42:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Peeka is a frog
08-07-2018T20:57:55,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like “ooo you draw?!? Draw me something!”
08-07-2018T20:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,And you’re like “I’m also a part time serial killer. Can I murder you for free too?”
08-07-2018T20:58:59,unsteddyphoenix,Murder AND art for free? Worth~
08-07-2018T20:59:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll murder you and use the blood as paint for your portrait
08-07-2018T20:59:44,Ordithus,"Ooh, a personal touch."

08-07-2018T21:00:41,unsteddyphoenix,paid for in blood
08-07-2018T21:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Depends on the artwork, the person, the blood used before it coagulates"
08-07-2018T21:01:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ya know, the usual"
08-07-2018T21:09:24,Bgrmystr2,well I don't think paid for in blood
