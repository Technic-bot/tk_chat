17-11-2018T13:37:53,Mippy,I think I've decided on Indian. I'll compramise with being heathy and get something Vegitarian :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
17-11-2018T13:38:35,RimaDraws,reptile expo?
17-11-2018T13:41:24,Dadrobit,"Yeah, tons of breeders at the convention center all selling exotic reptiles, amphibians, and insects and some respective enclosures."
17-11-2018T13:41:45,Dadrobit,Went yesterday and it was unbelievably packed in there.
17-11-2018T13:43:34,Dadrobit,"My little brother is the reptile aficionado of the two of us, but I enjoy snakes well enough to have fun perusing."
17-11-2018T13:44:33,RimaDraws,ehhh snakes
17-11-2018T13:44:40,RimaDraws,i like them but my mom has two pythons

17-11-2018T14:58:33,Twokinds,That looks cool
17-11-2018T14:58:48,Twokinds,"Not sure how well I can do neon in a sketch, but I could probably pull it off if it's picked."
17-11-2018T14:59:30,Twokinds,"Also, just found someone in the requests who's name doesn't match anyone in the Patron list."
17-11-2018T14:59:31,js199456,Good evening!
17-11-2018T14:59:44,Twokinds,"If you make a suggestion, make sure you use your Patron name or I can't verify you."
17-11-2018T15:00:03,js199456,Tom you'll be happy to hear that this time my suggestion is a bit more specific :P
17-11-2018T15:00:22,js199456,last weekend mine wasnt drawn cause it was a bit too general
17-11-2018T15:00:32,js199456,XD
17-11-2018T15:01:14,js199456,you may remember the pixie prank ^=^

17-11-2018T15:02:32,KitsuneShapeshifter,i wonder how many pokemon themed drawing were suggested due to pokemon: let's go hype
17-11-2018T15:02:36,Tharkis,*yawn* good afternoon all
17-11-2018T15:02:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Can you raise the lumber support?

17-11-2018T15:02:56,js199456,that's the issue
17-11-2018T15:03:04,js199456,it doesnt have lumbar support
17-11-2018T15:03:07,Tharkis,today we get to see how many dollars in leather i can ruin before making a passable 'Nekonomicon' book cover case for my new kindle
17-11-2018T15:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-KatDance::ctwokinds-nibsbounce::ctwokinds-nibsbounce::ctwokinds-FloDance:
17-11-2018T15:03:13,js199456,so i gotta stay up like a stick
17-11-2018T15:03:35,js199456,and drive for many miles
17-11-2018T15:03:42,Tharkis,"i cant draw, and i havent done any leather tooling really, but i've got the tools and a whole half of a cow to ruin trying to make it work =D"

17-11-2018T15:04:24,js199456,course!
17-11-2018T15:04:30,js199456,why didnt i think of that XD
17-11-2018T15:04:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Might find some at Walmart or something if not amazon
17-11-2018T15:05:17,js199456,i'll search on Amazon (no walmarts in my country)
17-11-2018T15:05:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Well Tom then you can just go get a better side
17-11-2018T15:05:30,Twokinds,uh... js
17-11-2018T15:05:36,Twokinds,Are you sure you submitted your suggestion?
17-11-2018T15:05:41,Twokinds,I see nothing about pixies in here
17-11-2018T15:06:09,js199456,I did
17-11-2018T15:06:15,js199456,but under the same idea
17-11-2018T15:06:23,js199456,from a diferent perspective
17-11-2018T15:06:32,js199456,so the pixie's are not mentioned
17-11-2018T15:06:36,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
17-11-2018T15:06:37,Twokinds,"Oh, I see"
17-11-2018T15:07:00,js199456,you see if people voted for it once they may not be inclined to vote for it again
17-11-2018T15:07:11,js199456,so you gotta make it attractive to them as something new
17-11-2018T15:07:20,js199456,that is what i went for
17-11-2018T15:07:26,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Hello people!
17-11-2018T15:07:30,TerraTheWizard,hi things
17-11-2018T15:09:07,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder if we'll see an increase of christmas themed suggestions
17-11-2018T15:09:18,Twokinds,I hope so
17-11-2018T15:09:39,js199456,did you found my suggestion Tom?
17-11-2018T15:09:40,KitsuneShapeshifter,"mine last week hit #3 in one of the polls, so close but also so far away :p"
17-11-2018T15:09:42,TerraTheWizard,i keep forgetting how close we are to xmas
17-11-2018T15:09:44,Twokinds,ye
17-11-2018T15:09:47,js199456,excellent
17-11-2018T15:10:10,TerraTheWizard,how are we already over half way through november
17-11-2018T15:10:12,ThingsAreMoving,"For a person who doesn't like cold, you sure sound happy to draw cold themed stuff, Tom :ctwokinds-smug:"
17-11-2018T15:10:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Because he stays inside
17-11-2018T15:11:15,js199456,Thanks for the recomendation Spazz
17-11-2018T15:11:32,js199456,i've found some lumbar support cushions that look pretty good
17-11-2018T15:11:41,js199456,i may get one at the end of the month
17-11-2018T15:11:48,ThingsAreMoving,I've changed my youngtani suggestion to something a bit weird/funny
17-11-2018T15:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,No problem. My mom has a bit of back problems and she uses the lumber support in the car to drive
17-11-2018T15:12:02,Twokinds,"Wait, how recently?"
17-11-2018T15:12:17,Twokinds,Cause I already downloaded them
17-11-2018T15:12:30,js199456,Cool! well hopefully it'll solve the issue
17-11-2018T15:13:54,ThingsAreMoving,"Oh, you mean my suggestion, Tom? I've put it in the form yesterday"
17-11-2018T15:14:02,ThingsAreMoving,so no problem
17-11-2018T15:14:31,Twokinds,okay phew
17-11-2018T15:14:32,infrawash,scketch for page 1046?
17-11-2018T15:14:42,Dimensional,Heh

17-11-2018T15:14:54,Dimensional,Can't wait. Hope my suggestion makes it in again.
17-11-2018T15:15:04,ThingsAreMoving,"I know you need some time to prepare for the stream, not gonna give you extra work in the last minute."
17-11-2018T15:15:15,Twokinds,"I can only wait so long before I have to start processing all the suggestions, so usually I give people until about 1pm est"
17-11-2018T15:15:20,Twokinds,3 hours before stream
17-11-2018T15:15:35,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, you might want to put that in the info box"
17-11-2018T15:15:44,ThingsAreMoving,I mean two days is plenty of time tbh
17-11-2018T15:15:56,InTheLionsDen,"Understandable.  Yes, it needs a posted cut-off time."
17-11-2018T15:16:45,ThingsAreMoving,"Most people have their lists of suggestions in a form of a text file and just copy, paste them once the form is available."
17-11-2018T15:16:48,ThingsAreMoving,afaik
17-11-2018T15:17:11,InTheLionsDen,I don't.
17-11-2018T15:17:25,infrawash,Follow your comic since 2015 (when I was 10 years old and I already had a cell phone) (now I'm 13 years old)
17-11-2018T15:17:37,TerraTheWizard,i have a .txt of my possible suggestions
17-11-2018T15:17:41,TerraTheWizard,have like 6 ready to go

17-11-2018T15:17:44,RimaDraws,i just remember mine
17-11-2018T15:18:13,TerraTheWizard,also in that same txt i keep track of the ones i won with
17-11-2018T15:18:13,RimaDraws,ive been going with the same one for almost two months

17-11-2018T15:18:26,js199456,hmm
17-11-2018T15:18:32,js199456,oh it works now
17-11-2018T15:18:38,ThingsAreMoving,"I have 13 suggestions in my file, four done, one on hold and the rest I just shuffle if they become stagnant in the polls."
17-11-2018T15:19:11,TerraTheWizard,"so i have 10 ready-to-go suggestions, 4 that need expanding on, and another 10 in a 'maybe-pile'"
17-11-2018T15:19:34,TerraTheWizard,"also 2 that i trashed but kept in a trash area of the file, lol"
17-11-2018T15:19:40,RimaDraws,?.?
17-11-2018T15:19:45,RimaDraws,i just get one as i go
17-11-2018T15:19:46,Tharkis,i just suggest what strieks my fancy =P  they've all been based on prior sketches
17-11-2018T15:19:51,Tharkis,strikes even
17-11-2018T15:20:23,Tharkis,"when they do well in voting i keep suggesting it, when they fall off, i abandon it =P   suggestions have a shelf life based on the sketch they're based on"
17-11-2018T15:20:28,TerraTheWizard,"that's what i did suddenly last week, forgot the details of it"
17-11-2018T15:20:34,TerraTheWizard,then it won
17-11-2018T15:20:45,TerraTheWizard,:|
17-11-2018T15:20:52,ZoopBoopLoop,Is it still an hour or two until it starts?
17-11-2018T15:21:00,RimaDraws,about 35 mins
17-11-2018T15:21:03,TerraTheWizard,'bout 40 mins
17-11-2018T15:21:05,Tharkis,"like the week after the plushy pic was colored, i made a suggestion for plush-nora causes plush mayhem , and it got like 3rd place votes, then dropped to 8th then last place"
17-11-2018T15:21:05,RimaDraws,40 maybe
17-11-2018T15:21:10,Tharkis,so it's never been suggested again D
17-11-2018T15:21:14,Tharkis,=D
17-11-2018T15:21:14,ThingsAreMoving,the vague one?
17-11-2018T15:21:45,TerraTheWizard,"oh tharkis, just remembered i've been seeing a lot of your commissions around lately, think we follow a lot of the same artists, lol"
17-11-2018T15:21:47,ThingsAreMoving,"oh, the 2nd part of the mind swap. I remember now."
17-11-2018T15:22:11,infrawash,√¨ ll see you lata at 4:00 pm
17-11-2018T15:22:27,infrawash,(later)
17-11-2018T15:25:21,ThingsAreMoving,"Btw I've ordered that coffee you've mentioned, Tom. It's... enjoyable but pretty mild. Had to put three packets into a cup to get it near the strength of the coffee I normally drink."
17-11-2018T15:25:36,ThingsAreMoving,Pretty good for an instant coffee.
17-11-2018T15:27:48,RimaDraws,i need to get my lunch

17-11-2018T16:15:10,Dimensional,Kat's massages are stuff of legend. So much that Lady Nora had to experience it for herself

17-11-2018T16:15:25,Katfeathers,one wink and it'd be all over

17-11-2018T16:17:25,CrimsonQuill,A wizard did it.
17-11-2018T16:17:35,CrimsonQuill,"Also, I think Nora could dodge the Pak 44"
17-11-2018T16:17:44,Katfeathers,Smaug has been over long without a date
17-11-2018T16:17:49,CrimsonQuill,That thing isn't meant for anti-air combat.
17-11-2018T16:18:24,CatzArt,i doubt that Quill. we could use a Bofors 40mm anti air gun
17-11-2018T16:18:28,Miftox01,and I guess Bofors would only work against the eyes
17-11-2018T16:18:48,SycrixART,CHOCOLATE AND PEANUT BUTTER
17-11-2018T16:18:52,Miftox01,and maybe the wing membranes
17-11-2018T16:18:54,CrimsonQuill,"Yes, but that's a dedicated anti air gun."

17-11-2018T16:24:21,Twokinds,Originally I wanted to make the dragons of Twokinds a lot different than the traditional dragons of fantasy

17-11-2018T16:24:38,MisterWho,absolutely
17-11-2018T16:24:41,Twokinds,Most dragons are either regal or beastly
17-11-2018T16:24:45,unsteddyphoenix,Reni especially
17-11-2018T16:24:45,CrimsonQuill,Your dragons are rather unique.
17-11-2018T16:24:51,Twokinds,"So I thought, hey, why not a pervy dragon and a dorky dragon"

17-11-2018T16:27:43,BluePhantom90,I will say the New Godzila anime is eh... Its okay but if anyone is True Godzila fans they would hate them
17-11-2018T16:27:59,CatzArt,"Things, and i wanna excuse to fire big guns."
17-11-2018T16:27:59,Tharkis,I like TK dragons exactly because they're more like people instead of being aloof and superior
17-11-2018T16:28:01,CrimsonQuill,I am not a true Godzilla fan.
17-11-2018T16:28:05,MisterWho,"The new Earth + Godzilla? Yeah, bit strange one."
17-11-2018T16:28:17,Yvatasha,hullo
17-11-2018T16:28:18,ProsePro7,The old 90s saturday morning cartoon was kinda good
17-11-2018T16:28:18,Tharkis,"pervy mischevious dragon, and dork-durgon"
17-11-2018T16:28:30,CrimsonQuill,Nora has quite the sense of humour.
17-11-2018T16:28:31,ThingsAreMoving,I feel the need to worship Nora even more.
17-11-2018T16:28:38,Miftox01,"If you had to choose wings to have permanently on yourself, which would you prefer, dragon-like or raven/angel-like?"

17-11-2018T16:28:56,CatzArt,I jest of course things. But i would be very uncomfortable around nora. she can read minds
17-11-2018T16:29:00,Yvatasha,I'm here and Idon't know what's going on
17-11-2018T16:29:04,MisterWho,Wings - depends. Which ones are easier to clean?
17-11-2018T16:29:05,CrimsonQuill,They'd be less likely to catch fire
17-11-2018T16:29:06,Katfeathers,double defector

17-11-2018T16:31:04,BadFoMo,And there was a cartoon in the 80s.
17-11-2018T16:31:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the 98 cartoon was miles better then the movie
17-11-2018T16:31:20,CatzArt,for what anime?
17-11-2018T16:31:28,Combak,Godzilla
17-11-2018T16:31:28,Twokinds,Weird that the Japanese would adapt an American movie into a japanese anime

17-11-2018T16:40:58,CatzArt,The idea was that we would have a saloon bar fight BGR.

17-11-2018T16:45:56,MarshallMelon,You could make a slightly suggestive picture of a rock and it'd be too much for Patreon
17-11-2018T16:45:57,Mippy,Better put a burka on her to be safe
17-11-2018T16:46:00,Bgrmystr2,they are prudes after all

17-11-2018T16:46:55,CatzArt,i would consider this casual nudity. not sure what patreon would think though

17-11-2018T16:49:04,CatzArt,Mister our standard may be different from the normies but we must put on a good face for the fandom. Help uncle Kage white wash us so the public doesnt kick us out of pitsburg
17-11-2018T16:49:20,ThingsAreMoving,"Kat massages Nora back into her true Dragon form. :ctwokinds-katwet:*[welp, now that's a challenge!]"
17-11-2018T16:49:34,MarshallMelon,It's got a good shot at winning the end-of-month poll if Iliar doesn't get to it first
17-11-2018T16:49:37,unsteddyphoenix,thats the version i wanna see things
17-11-2018T16:49:40,InTheLionsDen,Kat massages Nora into Reni
17-11-2018T16:49:40,CatzArt,you would need many Kats to massage dragon form nora

17-11-2018T16:51:09,MarshallMelon,"DA kinda sits between Patreon and FA in the lewdness scale. Like, they'll accept most softcore things but the second you go NSFW they're outta there"
17-11-2018T16:51:13,js199456,is there a bust chart with Human Nora ?
17-11-2018T16:51:27,iliar,@MarshallMelon Yes... I think about it. But I'm not completely sure yet.
17-11-2018T16:51:27,Bgrmystr2,I don't think so js
17-11-2018T16:51:27,ThingsAreMoving,"Not yet, js"
17-11-2018T16:51:34,js199456,darn
17-11-2018T16:51:40,RimaDraws,marsh you just need nsfw tags
17-11-2018T16:51:49,js199456,maybe i should suggest that next time
17-11-2018T16:51:50,Bgrmystr2,"not always, Rima"
17-11-2018T16:51:56,ThingsAreMoving,Maybe you should
17-11-2018T16:51:58,BadFoMo,"Am I the only one who could see Kathrin 'masashing' Nora, and /she's/ the one to transform?"
17-11-2018T16:52:03,RimaDraws,ive been on DA for 7 years

17-11-2018T16:52:12,Bgrmystr2,There's a reason FA exists.
17-11-2018T16:52:14,MarshallMelon,Even the tags aren't enough
17-11-2018T16:52:18,Bgrmystr2,yeah ^
17-11-2018T16:52:19,TerraTheWizard,dA is fine with nsfw as long as it's not hardcore
17-11-2018T16:52:25,CatzArt,Heh hopefully it stays that way
17-11-2018T16:52:25,TerraTheWizard,basically
17-11-2018T16:52:25,RimaDraws,yea some things aren't allowed
17-11-2018T16:52:31,ThingsAreMoving,that's true
17-11-2018T16:52:38,ThingsAreMoving,can confirm

17-11-2018T16:52:47,Katfeathers,"considering the hamsters work, it's one of those label and teir wall things a Patreon"
17-11-2018T16:53:16,Mippy,No pronz? :shrimp:
17-11-2018T16:53:27,McClaw,Hmm. I'm on a griffon kick -- but I don't remember anything like that in the comic or commission stuff so far.
17-11-2018T16:53:32,CatzArt,it sucks that Patreon is cracking down. Fenoxo.com has had to dial back his games so patreon wont cut him loose
17-11-2018T16:54:03,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
17-11-2018T16:54:05,Combak,There have been no griffons in TK.
17-11-2018T16:54:12,ProsePro7,An hour in and one drawing down...this is going to be a long stream
17-11-2018T16:54:15,Twokinds,I had this specific song stuck in my head all day yesterday
17-11-2018T16:54:16,Combak,How does he do that Catz?
17-11-2018T16:54:24,MarshallMelon,I imagine a service based around financial transactions probably has a few more regulations it needs to follow versus your average art site
17-11-2018T16:54:32,MarshallMelon,So it kinda makes sense
17-11-2018T16:54:40,RimaDraws,i had this playing earlier @Twokinds
17-11-2018T16:54:40,MisterWho,@CatzArt: I'm already helping uncle Kage at the EF. ;)
17-11-2018T16:54:42,CatzArt,do what Combak? make smutty text games?

17-11-2018T17:01:17,CrRAR,ya'know if kat causes Nora to transform she could get squished like whoever was saying earlier.
17-11-2018T17:01:26,ThingsAreMoving,Holy mother of God
17-11-2018T17:01:27,CatzArt,is SAI better than Clip Studio?

17-11-2018T17:02:26,Dimensional,I remember once being said that Nora didn't like being a biped/human form because she couldn't keep her balance walking on two legs.
17-11-2018T17:02:35,Tharkis,kitty cat nora =^.^=

17-11-2018T17:03:15,Bgrmystr2,"it's also that, things"
17-11-2018T17:03:20,Combak,Or Nora just transforms to look like Kat.

17-11-2018T19:23:42,CatzArt,This is by democratic vote so we do what the majority wants
17-11-2018T19:24:18,Mippy,Was wondering what was going on...had the stream paused again. :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
17-11-2018T19:24:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah, I figured that Nora would get picked.  Well, my cosplay request did move back up into the top 10."
17-11-2018T19:24:40,CatzArt,Although i would like to learn transformation magic. I would put it to good use wink wink.
17-11-2018T19:24:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's what the Electoral college is for: to prevent the majority from having power over the minority.

17-11-2018T19:25:45,Tharkis,"it was established when there was no mass communication, so that people could elect peopel who 'knew what the heck was going on'  to represent their votes"

17-11-2018T19:25:48,totallynotTrace,"No tharkis, thats what its turned into"

17-11-2018T19:26:15,Tharkis,"seems most like ""respect your elders"""
17-11-2018T19:26:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hm...I figured that there was something like a dragon council or something.
17-11-2018T19:26:25,Tharkis,in what we've seen thus far
17-11-2018T19:26:28,Dimensional,What Tharkis said
17-11-2018T19:26:29,NeonMitsumi,You're either well respected and a dragon.......or you're a lizard.
17-11-2018T19:26:38,ThingsAreMoving,Their Government is matriarchy in theory (as Nora is the strongest and eldest as far as we know)
17-11-2018T19:26:41,Dimensional,"Essentially, the oldest dragons have the most respect among dragon kind"
17-11-2018T19:26:59,CatzArt,i wonder if the dragons amass there arch drakist followers to battle each other
17-11-2018T19:26:59,unsteddyphoenix,Dragons dont have a government
17-11-2018T19:27:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Still, there has to be someone more powerful than Nora."
17-11-2018T19:27:10,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre almost all individuals
17-11-2018T19:27:15,Dimensional,"There has, but Nora doesn't care about the Masks."
17-11-2018T19:27:19,Dimensional,She does what she wants to do.
17-11-2018T19:27:22,totallynotTrace,the masks might have more power thatn nora
17-11-2018T19:27:29,ThingsAreMoving,Dragons are anarchists?
17-11-2018T19:27:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Thinks back to where Adelaide dragged Nora by the dragon's tongue.
17-11-2018T19:27:44,CatzArt,Still i wonder why Nora is infatuiated with Trace?
17-11-2018T19:27:54,Dimensional,Nobody knows.
17-11-2018T19:27:56,Xexanoth,cause he has the power
17-11-2018T19:27:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,Maybe dragons are attracted to magical power.
17-11-2018T19:27:57,Dimensional,Only Tom knows.

17-11-2018T19:28:27,ThingsAreMoving,"Nora: Nicely done, Trace. But next time try to actually keep them alive, too."
17-11-2018T19:28:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Theyre isolationists, I guess?"
17-11-2018T19:28:39,FenceEqualizer,Though it might not be why she sticks around. Just the start.
17-11-2018T19:28:46,KitsuneShapeshifter,well old trace has done TF punishment before

17-11-2018T19:29:07,Dimensional,"Nice Trace, but now try to have a complete transformation, instead of giving them Keidran ears? That's my thing."
17-11-2018T19:29:09,sunblaze,some call if punishment. some call it boost :P

17-11-2018T19:29:22,CatzArt,I remember a page in the comic way back when where Nora was questioning if trace was trace and he got angry released some powah and nora kinda err flushed a bit

17-11-2018T19:29:29,FenceEqualizer,Maybe Nora just thinks Trace has a nice butt.

17-11-2018T19:31:18,MisterWho,I don't think Nora can be bought with shiny things. That might end horrble for trhe wannybebuyer. - and funny for her. XD
17-11-2018T19:31:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Not to mention, the only person I think who is a better trickster than Nora is Bart Simpson."
17-11-2018T19:31:38,sunblaze,but trace himself might be shiny!
17-11-2018T19:31:42,ThingsAreMoving,I think the most important currency for Nora is entertainment.
17-11-2018T19:31:45,CrimsonHelsing,"idk, Lyn'Knoll paid her handsomely to keep their secret iirc"
17-11-2018T19:31:52,Dimensional,She doesn't like being bought by shiny trinkets. That's why I care a fat stack of doller bills.

17-11-2018T20:13:03,Mippy,I think we know everything we need to know about Rose up to this point. If there is anything else it will come in time

17-11-2018T20:14:01,Bgrmystr2,but it showed that Saria is the one that saved Rose
17-11-2018T20:14:04,CrimsonQuill,Trust me-I've seen
17-11-2018T20:14:08,ProsePro7,Geeze when was this?
17-11-2018T20:14:11,Mippy,Honestly there are other minor characters I‚Äôm more interested in

17-11-2018T20:14:21,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-11-2018T20:14:31,ShadowSoap,Probably shortly after the gallows scene
17-11-2018T20:14:42,CrimsonQuill,I rather like this one.
17-11-2018T20:14:48,CrimsonQuill,It's sweet.
17-11-2018T20:15:06,CrimsonQuill,"Plus, it shows a little more depth in the characters."
17-11-2018T20:15:10,ProsePro7,I cant pull it up it keeps blocking me
17-11-2018T20:15:21,ThingsAreMoving,whut
17-11-2018T20:15:37,Bgrmystr2,well it's not a patron-only image so it'll load eventually
17-11-2018T20:15:48,CatzArt,Everything that was asked of us we have done. Every night we lay in a filthy foxhole praying the enemy won't slit our throats. Every day we spent crawling through the mud and the dirt while bullets whistled all around. thats all i remember of his speech
17-11-2018T20:15:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So, if I did a cosplay request, does anyone know what would people be the most familiar with?"
17-11-2018T20:15:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,Besides Star Wars.

17-11-2018T20:16:41,unsteddyphoenix,Ok cool
17-11-2018T20:16:46,Combak,Easiest cosplay yet... I think.
17-11-2018T20:16:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think the cosplay idea has to be one that TK fan community is most familiar with?
17-11-2018T20:17:05,Combak,"That was to Quill, btw"
17-11-2018T20:17:06,ShadowSoap,"Soooo, something from another webcomic?"
17-11-2018T20:17:16,CrimsonQuill,@Combak I know
17-11-2018T20:17:28,CatzArt,I should have done Reznov quotes when Kat was part of glorious red army. oh well
17-11-2018T20:17:32,CrimsonQuill,I've just watched Jacksepticeye's playthrough of it
17-11-2018T20:17:40,CrimsonQuill,10 episodes
17-11-2018T20:17:41,unsteddyphoenix,lol true. missed the boat
17-11-2018T20:17:41,Mippy,Dust is pretty well known...or....maybe another web comic
17-11-2018T20:18:02,CrimsonQuill,'Hello! My name is Connor! I'm the Android sent by Cyberlife!'
17-11-2018T20:18:14,CatzArt,Dust an elysian tail of something else called dust?
17-11-2018T20:18:34,Mippy,Elysian Tail...
17-11-2018T20:18:39,BadFoMo,Thoes eyes look somewhat hateful.
17-11-2018T20:18:50,ShadowSoap,Maybe Slightly Damned? Seems to be plenty of overlap between the communities

17-11-2018T20:20:09,Dadrobit,Seems like something she does.
17-11-2018T20:20:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that would be an escalation
17-11-2018T20:20:17,CatzArt,Hey daddy is here Whats Up? other than the sky

17-11-2018T20:21:15,ThingsAreMoving,only when she needed the views for FurTube
17-11-2018T20:21:35,unsteddyphoenix,gotta get that clickbait
17-11-2018T20:21:37,ShadowSoap,I don't think that world has the internet yet
17-11-2018T20:21:40,CatzArt,Yeah fratricide for the win with these two. but Euchre did through her under the metaphorical bus

17-11-2018T20:22:35,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit I don't think it came up yet.
17-11-2018T20:22:42,RimaDraws,it came up with mine
17-11-2018T20:22:43,Combak,... What does Dust have to do with that Palmetto?
17-11-2018T20:22:45,Dadrobit,Still love most y'all anyways
17-11-2018T20:22:47,RimaDraws,i voted for it

17-11-2018T20:22:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,i don't know what it's about.
17-11-2018T20:23:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,What about Metroid?
17-11-2018T20:23:17,Combak,But... I... What?
17-11-2018T20:23:36,Mippy,Never played it Palm but maybe
17-11-2018T20:23:37,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, 6 votes...."
17-11-2018T20:23:38,Combak,We weern't even talking about Dust!
17-11-2018T20:23:39,ThingsAreMoving,I got some dragons today so I'm happy.
17-11-2018T20:23:46,CatzArt,Dust is a good game
17-11-2018T20:23:52,Dadrobit,That's rough
17-11-2018T20:24:01,ShadowSoap,>_<
17-11-2018T20:24:18,RimaDraws,like i said dad i voted
17-11-2018T20:24:19,Combak,The book club suggestion just uses one of W0lfmare's characters.
17-11-2018T20:24:21,unsteddyphoenix,"I got 7 dad, get destroyed :sunglasses:"
17-11-2018T20:24:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I thought about Front Mission, but I don't think many people here are mecha fans.  Heck, I was going to suggest Battletech, but again same problem."
17-11-2018T20:24:22,Dadrobit,But I need me some cross comic shenaniganry
17-11-2018T20:24:23,CatzArt,>_<
17-11-2018T20:24:23,RimaDraws,and so did crimson i think
17-11-2018T20:24:34,Mippy,@Combak Palm was asking for cross over ideas that would be popular with our community. Dust was suggested
17-11-2018T20:24:42,146Time,Oh man I LOVE battletech

17-11-2018T20:25:12,ThingsAreMoving,Dad you need to go on a pilgrimage
17-11-2018T20:25:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,So maybe Battletech might be a good one.
17-11-2018T20:25:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Mine hasn't shown up yet, I wonder what level I'll be"
17-11-2018T20:25:16,CatzArt,Im going to bail my computer is over heating night all

17-11-2018T20:55:19,CatzArt,oh too many good ones I guess tom will have to do them all. Although tom being able to draw for 5 hours straight is impressive in its own right. it would take me this long to finish one piece and he is on six
17-11-2018T20:55:24,Combak,Oh boy... KANDAT and KAZDAT...

17-11-2018T20:56:29,CatzArt,he did a jump and fell off a bridge
17-11-2018T20:56:34,Twokinds,lol

17-11-2018T21:08:36,RandomTonio,I feel like there should be an art contest involving rejected TK SKetch Ideas
17-11-2018T21:08:39,ThingsAreMoving,Fortunately 50% of the pictures are Tom's picks so If you feel he chooses generic ideas over great ones you can always call him out on that. :ctwokinds-smug:

17-11-2018T21:50:08,FenceEqualizer,Best use of my lazy Sunday afternoons. :ptv-hearts:
17-11-2018T21:50:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night everybody headed out
17-11-2018T21:50:24,Dadrobit,Have a good one all y'all that are leaving.
17-11-2018T21:50:25,ThingsAreMoving,"Yep, good night peeps"
17-11-2018T21:50:28,Twokinds,lol I gotta admit that chicken one had me the most worried.
17-11-2018T21:50:33,Dadrobit,?
17-11-2018T21:50:34,RimaDraws,lol it looked great
17-11-2018T21:50:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,really XD
17-11-2018T21:50:39,AFallingTree,How so?
17-11-2018T21:50:46,Combak,Oh?
17-11-2018T21:50:48,MrEase,what a fun stream
17-11-2018T21:50:49,Twokinds,"Because I knew that's the idea I'd go for if that suggestion was picked, and I did NOT know if I could pull off an anthro chicken."
17-11-2018T21:50:58,AFallingTree,Ooh lol
17-11-2018T21:50:59,MrEase,this was a good day
17-11-2018T21:51:02,Combak,"Eh, you did a good enough job."
17-11-2018T21:51:07,TheBeckoner,It looked good tho
17-11-2018T21:51:13,Dadrobit,I thought it looked totally fine.
17-11-2018T21:51:16,FenceEqualizer,Too Lewd
17-11-2018T21:51:16,Bgrmystr2,you did legitimately good imo tom
17-11-2018T21:51:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I say it was well anthro'd
17-11-2018T21:51:26,Dimensional,"You did it pretty well, Tom"
17-11-2018T21:51:38,Dimensional,I give you a 10 out of 10
17-11-2018T21:51:48,FenceEqualizer,"Yeah, was a pretty good bird woman."
17-11-2018T21:52:10,BluePhantom90,BTW Tom I liked how you edited my sketch suggestion. It worked a lot more. Though I don't think people saw it unless I pointed it out
17-11-2018T21:52:23,Dimensional,:)
17-11-2018T21:52:36,AFallingTree,What one was yours blue?
17-11-2018T21:52:36,Dimensional,Goodnight Tom. Have a great week!
17-11-2018T21:52:37,Dadrobit,It's easy. First you draw a circle. Then you draw the rest of the bird lady.
17-11-2018T21:52:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,So easy even I can do it XD
17-11-2018T21:52:53,MrEase,the bird lady is shaped like a friend
17-11-2018T21:52:57,RandomTonio,"So, now what? We begin something else?"
17-11-2018T21:53:07,Mippy,No
17-11-2018T21:53:08,unsteddyphoenix,yeah the chicken was pretty cute
17-11-2018T21:53:12,Twokinds,I had to sum it up to make it fit better
17-11-2018T21:53:17,Dadrobit,Incoming macro avian anthros
17-11-2018T21:53:18,unsteddyphoenix,You reckon you could pull off an anthro moth though?
17-11-2018T21:53:29,Twokinds,And yeah I was happy with how the chicken girl turned out XD
17-11-2018T21:53:42,Dimensional,I'm sure that chicken girl used to be an ordinary boy too. XP
17-11-2018T21:53:42,MrEase,nah I'm probably not gonna draw that Dadrobit
17-11-2018T21:53:48,Dadrobit,Ah well.
17-11-2018T21:53:57,MrEase,I'm probably going to ruin dragon nat >:D
17-11-2018T21:53:59,BluePhantom90,hold on I will post my sketch idea
17-11-2018T21:54:04,Dimensional,"But you did it great, Tom. It was enjoyable, plus gave us plenty of chicken puns."
17-11-2018T21:54:06,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds gross
17-11-2018T21:54:08,unsteddyphoenix,But
17-11-2018T21:54:14,unsteddyphoenix,At least let it be busty
17-11-2018T21:54:20,Dadrobit,Saw some cool moths for sale today at the Reptile expo. They were like $60 though.
17-11-2018T21:54:25,Corinthian,"Thanks for the stream, Tom!"
17-11-2018T21:54:27,FenceEqualizer,Everything Can't be busty.
17-11-2018T21:54:29,Combak,Well... At least it's a dragon.
17-11-2018T21:54:35,TheBeckoner,How long do those live Robit?
17-11-2018T21:54:36,unsteddyphoenix,reptile expo?
17-11-2018T21:54:37,FenceEqualizer,At least that's what I am suppose to say.
17-11-2018T21:54:40,MrEase,"actually thats also a lie, I have too much on my plate right now"
17-11-2018T21:54:42,Dadrobit,They were dead and mounted.
17-11-2018T21:54:46,TheBeckoner,ahhhhhh
17-11-2018T21:54:56,TheBeckoner,I thought you meant as a pet.
17-11-2018T21:55:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,reptile expo is where you get to hang out with pretty much modern day dino's unsteddy
17-11-2018T21:55:05,unsteddyphoenix,huh.
17-11-2018T21:55:08,Combak,"Oh, that is a good point..."
17-11-2018T21:55:10,Dadrobit,"Yeah, PHX Reptile Expo was this weekend. Went with my little bro."
17-11-2018T21:55:12,unsteddyphoenix,I feel mike moths arent reptiles but ok
17-11-2018T21:55:30,Dimensional,Night Tom
17-11-2018T21:55:34,Dadrobit,They also do amphibians and exotic spiders.
17-11-2018T21:55:40,Twokinds,I think moths wouldn't be too hard
17-11-2018T21:55:44,Twokinds,Cause they're already fluffy
17-11-2018T21:55:52,Mippy,Ugh! Spiders üï∑
17-11-2018T21:55:53,RimaDraws,oooh
17-11-2018T21:56:08,RimaDraws,i don't like spiders
17-11-2018T21:56:14,unsteddyphoenix,Interesting~
17-11-2018T21:56:24,unsteddyphoenix,Ive seen anthro moths before and I actually kinda like 'em
17-11-2018T21:56:31,unsteddyphoenix,So that might be a req at some point
17-11-2018T21:56:41,Dadrobit,Bro almost got some new ackies (lizard thing) but the seller refused to budge on the price.
17-11-2018T21:56:51,MrEase,moths are cute
17-11-2018T21:56:57,BluePhantom90,"Okay my sketch idea was ""Adelaide actually comes from an island of Amazon Basitins who are looking for their lost offspring."""
17-11-2018T21:56:58,RimaDraws,i dont like moths
17-11-2018T21:57:04,RimaDraws,too dusty
17-11-2018T21:57:12,unsteddyphoenix,Just keep 'em clean
17-11-2018T21:57:17,Mippy,"Oh, Blue, I voted for that."
17-11-2018T21:57:22,unsteddyphoenix,Implying you already have some lizards dad?
17-11-2018T21:57:38,Dadrobit,Me? No. Little brother is all about reptiles though.
17-11-2018T21:57:46,unsteddyphoenix,ah right
17-11-2018T21:57:51,Dadrobit,I just like to look at em all and hold some of em.
17-11-2018T21:57:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"ok, since unsteady won't buy me taco bell I guess I'll have to go get it my self.  see ya lads"
17-11-2018T21:58:01,Dadrobit,o/ Marv
17-11-2018T21:58:11,Mippy,I‚Äôve held reptiles...never owns one though
17-11-2018T21:58:13,FenceEqualizer,"Later Marv, I shall pray for your colon."
17-11-2018T21:58:18,unsteddyphoenix,we dont have taco bell!
17-11-2018T21:58:27,Dadrobit,Tons of cool critters. Lots of albinos selling for ludicrous amounts of money.
17-11-2018T21:58:28,BluePhantom90,"I would have laughed more If the Guards pulled a ""begin operation Giant women invasion evacuation alpha!"""
17-11-2018T21:58:48,Bgrmystr2,even in the future.. phoenix is not future enough to live past the franchise wars.
17-11-2018T21:58:56,Bgrmystr2,how unfortunate..
17-11-2018T21:59:03,BluePhantom90,All males just vanish again after they just came out of hidding
17-11-2018T21:59:05,MrEase,"did someone say ""giant woman"" :V"
17-11-2018T21:59:06,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/QRwA7Mz.jpg Brother with one of his snakes from a while back.
17-11-2018T21:59:21,Bgrmystr2,ahh I remember this image
17-11-2018T21:59:23,Bgrmystr2,the danger noodle
17-11-2018T21:59:23,MrEase,I have been summoned
17-11-2018T21:59:41,Combak,lol
17-11-2018T21:59:48,Dadrobit,Red Tailed Boa. She's very lovable.
17-11-2018T21:59:51,unsteddyphoenix,Dont tread on him
17-11-2018T21:59:54,FenceEqualizer,I remember that picture.
17-11-2018T21:59:56,unsteddyphoenix,He looks older than you
17-11-2018T22:00:04,FenceEqualizer,Not sure how he does it.
17-11-2018T22:00:05,BluePhantom90,Yes @MrEase the Amazon Basitin would have been giant women like Kind Adelaide
17-11-2018T22:00:14,BluePhantom90,*king
17-11-2018T22:00:27,Dadrobit,"He's a few years younger than me. Also, we're not actually related."
17-11-2018T22:00:35,Mippy,Somehow that is not what I expected him to look like....snake is really long
17-11-2018T22:00:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah right, fair"
17-11-2018T22:00:58,MrEase,ehh thats not really what I was getting at
17-11-2018T22:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,yeah powerful snek friend
17-11-2018T22:01:08,Dadrobit,"Yeah, she's getting bigger all the time. She's ginormous now."
17-11-2018T22:01:34,Mippy,Dang! I can‚Äôt imagine that getting out at night
17-11-2018T22:01:46,MrEase,OWO
17-11-2018T22:02:25,Dadrobit,"Nah, she's totally chill. Likes hanging out with people."
17-11-2018T22:02:39,MrEase,pet snakes are generally like that
17-11-2018T22:02:42,BluePhantom90,Really wanted to know how Tom would do the Amazon women one. Do something like the D.C. Amazon's looking like Female Spartans or like the Island Women basitins
17-11-2018T22:02:44,Combak,"""Hanging out."""
17-11-2018T22:02:47,MrEase,they either don't care
17-11-2018T22:02:56,Mippy,"Well, I‚Äôm out. See ya later."
17-11-2018T22:02:57,MrEase,or they want to be around you all the time because warmth
17-11-2018T22:03:06,InTheLionsDen,and tasty
17-11-2018T22:03:11,FenceEqualizer,Later Mippy
17-11-2018T22:03:36,FenceEqualizer,"See that's why people don't trust snakes, only want you for your warmth."
17-11-2018T22:03:52,FenceEqualizer,That and they don't wear their emotions on their sleeves like other pets.
17-11-2018T22:03:56,Dadrobit,"Ehhhhh, some snakes can get kinda feisty, even if they're pets. Brother had one carpet boa that would just become a striker for a week straight for no damned reason every once in a while."
17-11-2018T22:04:06,Dadrobit,o/ Mippy
17-11-2018T22:04:28,MrEase,"see I'm just sad because one week there was an ""attack of the 50 ft woman parody ft. Adelaide"" and everyone tagged me saying it was my suggestion... but it wasn't and after that week it just disappeared"
17-11-2018T22:04:42,MrEase,and I was like shoot
17-11-2018T22:04:46,MrEase,I need to see that
17-11-2018T22:05:06,Combak,Didn't you make that anyways?
17-11-2018T22:05:07,Dadrobit,lol
17-11-2018T22:05:22,Dadrobit,He did Attack on Titan once IIRC?
17-11-2018T22:05:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah he did Attack on Natani
17-11-2018T22:05:40,Dadrobit,Dunno if it was with Adelaide or Natani tho
17-11-2018T22:05:43,MrEase,Not really the macro pic I did of adelaide I did was waaaay bigger than 50 ft lol
17-11-2018T22:05:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, NAtnai"
17-11-2018T22:05:50,MrEase,it was with Nat and Eric I recall
17-11-2018T22:06:08,MrEase,I had hoped it was with Keith cause it could double as a short joke
17-11-2018T22:06:59,MrEase,man I miss when Tom used to draw size stuff all the time
17-11-2018T22:07:28,Combak,So... Keith and Nat stuff?
17-11-2018T22:07:30,MrEase,I get it though suggestion based pics kinda weed that out
17-11-2018T22:08:12,MrEase,No there was very little with Keith and Nat
17-11-2018T22:08:19,MrEase,it was mostly tiny traces and stuff
17-11-2018T22:08:35,MrEase,and don't worry I get the joke
17-11-2018T22:08:50,MrEase,"just saying, I miss it haha"
17-11-2018T22:11:01,MrEase,lol I come off as so desperate
17-11-2018T22:11:20,Combak,"Eh, you're fine."
17-11-2018T22:11:58,Combak,"I mean, to be fair, you COULD make whatever it is yourself."
17-11-2018T22:12:23,MrEase,I mean thats kinda why I started
17-11-2018T22:12:55,Combak,True
17-11-2018T22:14:11,Dadrobit,:/ I got into drawing just cause my sister was so good at it and I was jealous...
17-11-2018T22:14:44,Dadrobit,Now I get to be bad at art for myself!
17-11-2018T22:14:50,BluePhantom90,I would so like to do a Daniels and Therie on the road
17-11-2018T22:14:57,FenceEqualizer,Hey Envy can be a great motivator.
17-11-2018T22:15:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Envy motivates a lot of art, I bet."
17-11-2018T22:15:37,unsteddyphoenix,Its my main motivation right now~
17-11-2018T22:15:40,Dadrobit,"Oof, you're right, envy, not jealousy."
17-11-2018T22:16:06,BluePhantom90,"I had one ""The difference between Papa Daniels food gathering, and Mama Therie Food gathering"""
17-11-2018T22:16:55,BluePhantom90,"See Therie has a Bear, a huge wild boar and two deer with Daniels saying "" Remind me never to piss you off"""
17-11-2018T22:17:25,Dadrobit,Papa Daniels has a turkey roasted on the table. Mama Therie gets the spitroast ready for the human her daughter caught.
17-11-2018T22:17:31,Twokinds,Got my dinner
17-11-2018T22:17:37,Bgrmystr2,wb
17-11-2018T22:17:43,Dadrobit,wb with dinner
17-11-2018T22:17:45,unsteddyphoenix,Nice~ whatcha eatin
17-11-2018T22:17:53,Dadrobit,Watermelon
17-11-2018T22:17:59,BluePhantom90,wb Tom
17-11-2018T22:18:42,Twokinds,"Popcorn, walnuts, gummy bears, spice drops, and kimchi"
17-11-2018T22:18:58,FenceEqualizer,My baby tooth just cried out in horror at that list.
17-11-2018T22:18:58,Dadrobit,RIP your tastebuds.
17-11-2018T22:19:02,Bgrmystr2,spice drops are awesome
17-11-2018T22:19:18,BluePhantom90,"Well I was thinking more seeing Daniels only having rabbits over a Fire from what he was hunting, while Therie has a While boar cooking over the fire."
17-11-2018T22:19:41,unsteddyphoenix,I dont even know where to begin
17-11-2018T22:20:02,unsteddyphoenix,Spice drops are a candy?
17-11-2018T22:20:24,BluePhantom90,Since Therie would be a good mother tiger getting her baby and husband all the food they need
17-11-2018T22:21:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, they also make them THC infused."
17-11-2018T22:21:01,Bgrmystr2,yeah phoenix
17-11-2018T22:21:15,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
17-11-2018T22:21:29,unsteddyphoenix,I assume youre mixing all those foods together or...

17-11-2018T22:22:25,Dadrobit,Halloween has never been so fun
17-11-2018T22:22:30,Twokinds,lol
17-11-2018T22:22:43,SIROUS25,Lol you here
17-11-2018T22:22:47,FenceEqualizer,Robit please.
17-11-2018T22:23:09,FenceEqualizer,Argh! I miss junk food. >_<
17-11-2018T22:23:12,unsteddyphoenix,Wow this site is extensive
17-11-2018T22:23:32,Twokinds,"Well, they look like those. Less thc though I assume"
17-11-2018T22:23:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, probably a lot less"
17-11-2018T22:23:59,unsteddyphoenix,But not defintely~!
17-11-2018T22:24:00,FenceEqualizer,Fracking poked a hole in my baby tooth cause of popcorn.
17-11-2018T22:24:54,FenceEqualizer,Now stuck in limbo
17-11-2018T22:25:38,Twokinds,That's... bad?
17-11-2018T22:26:01,Bgrmystr2,"are these actually alchoholic, Dadro?"
17-11-2018T22:26:02,unsteddyphoenix,You still have a baby tooth?
17-11-2018T22:26:14,FenceEqualizer,"Yeah, Born missing two adult teeth"
17-11-2018T22:26:31,Bgrmystr2,they didn't fall out anyway..?
17-11-2018T22:26:44,Dadrobit,That's not alcoholic. THC is the stuff in weed that gets you high. Not drunk.
17-11-2018T22:26:45,FenceEqualizer,"Nope, they where stubborn things and I tried to take care of them."
17-11-2018T22:26:57,Bgrmystr2,ooh okay
17-11-2018T22:27:13,FenceEqualizer,"But it got to weak and cracked,"
17-11-2018T22:27:14,Bgrmystr2,"you need to go to a dentist proper for that, probably"
17-11-2018T22:27:21,Bgrmystr2,especially if it's damaged
17-11-2018T22:27:34,RimaDraws,absess tooth?
17-11-2018T22:27:39,FenceEqualizer,"Yeah, probably going to have to get implants. Though I kinda want to save it"
17-11-2018T22:28:03,RimaDraws,if its your wisdom tooth they won't save it
17-11-2018T22:28:05,MrEase,even though weed became legal in my country I still dunno about trying it
17-11-2018T22:28:07,RimaDraws,it has to be pulled
17-11-2018T22:28:18,MrEase,it would probably do wonders for my anxiety but I just don't know
17-11-2018T22:28:38,FenceEqualizer,Nah it's a molar. Though not worried about it being pulled
17-11-2018T22:28:41,RimaDraws,my first one i had cracked and a cavity in my wisdom tooth they said its better to pull than leave in
17-11-2018T22:28:45,Dadrobit,"Eh, it depends. Like any vice, it's not for everybody."
17-11-2018T22:28:49,MrEase,"Ironically too anxious about what I'd be like while high, to bother trying it"
17-11-2018T22:28:53,RimaDraws,being pulled might be better
17-11-2018T22:29:02,FenceEqualizer,Apperently it doesn't have any roots. It's just there out of pure stubborness
17-11-2018T22:29:53,Dadrobit,"Some strains of mj can have the side effect of making the user extra aware, or anxious, so you'd likely want to make sure you stayed away from those."
17-11-2018T22:30:19,Dadrobit,Straight THC infused edibles are just for the high though.
17-11-2018T22:30:28,FenceEqualizer,Though mostly worried about the implants. Don't want my head drilled....again XP That and wallet will be crying
17-11-2018T22:30:54,BluePhantom90,So Tom the whole Daniels and Therie Sketch story seemed fun. Did you enjoy doing them?
17-11-2018T22:31:00,MrEase,I mean the only way to get them in my province is by ordering it from the government online
17-11-2018T22:31:00,Dadrobit,"Has to be pure THC though. If it's distilled from one of those strains incompletely, then you may still get some of those side effects."
17-11-2018T22:31:08,Twokinds,I hate tooth pain. I can't deal. Gotta get it fixed.
17-11-2018T22:31:23,MrEase,so I don't think I'd be at risk of any shit being put in it
17-11-2018T22:31:35,Twokinds,Sure the Daniel and Therie saga was fun.
17-11-2018T22:31:41,Twokinds,I think it mostly ran its course.
17-11-2018T22:31:56,Twokinds,But I wouldn't mind the occasional revisit.
17-11-2018T22:32:03,BluePhantom90,hmm not until my sketch idea's get done. It shall continue!
17-11-2018T22:32:22,FenceEqualizer,Agreed Tom. Though going to miss my solider off a tooth. It was with me forever.
17-11-2018T22:32:35,MrEase,its nice that we've spent a bit of time away from them
17-11-2018T22:32:51,MrEase,it would be nice to come back
17-11-2018T22:32:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, I really got turned off 'em as it dragged on"
17-11-2018T22:33:05,unsteddyphoenix,But the occassional would be fun
17-11-2018T22:33:32,Bgrmystr2,"Didn't bother me any, but most 99.9% of the images here don't bother me any"
17-11-2018T22:33:36,Bgrmystr2,so :v
17-11-2018T22:33:40,BluePhantom90,"So doing the ""On the Road"" with Daniels and Therie"
17-11-2018T22:33:48,BluePhantom90,and baby
17-11-2018T22:33:50,FenceEqualizer,Hate to admit it but they did get kinda spammed so I can see why someone people got alittle irrated
17-11-2018T22:34:25,BluePhantom90,a lot of people are getting irrated with Kat massaging everyone now.
17-11-2018T22:34:29,Dadrobit,"It was definitely a ""thing"" but I think the worst moments of it still don't compare to the worst of KANDAT weeks."
17-11-2018T22:35:11,unsteddyphoenix,At least I know and like Keith and natani though
17-11-2018T22:35:14,Bgrmystr2,I actually get so much enjoyment from people just pulling names out of nowhere for popular stuff they don't like for no reason at all other than popularity
17-11-2018T22:35:20,FenceEqualizer,Never enough KANDAT :ptv-dealwithit:
17-11-2018T22:35:21,Bgrmystr2,it's great
17-11-2018T22:35:58,FenceEqualizer,Though I do like seeing how minor characters interact.
17-11-2018T22:36:21,FenceEqualizer,It's fun plus it gives a little bit of life to the world
17-11-2018T22:36:31,Twokinds,It's cool the multitude of tiny sketch canons being developed collectively
17-11-2018T22:36:52,Dadrobit,Speaking of life to the world. I'll brb. Pizza is ready for pickup.
17-11-2018T22:37:03,BluePhantom90,"Still liked my ""Excaliber"" one with the King lifting the sword and the stone togehter"
17-11-2018T22:37:27,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah these little sketch sagas
17-11-2018T22:37:31,BluePhantom90,asking if it still counts
17-11-2018T22:37:39,RimaDraws,i mean they're fun
17-11-2018T22:39:06,Twokinds,Counts?
17-11-2018T22:40:05,Bgrmystr2,"it wasn't part of a series though, was it?"
17-11-2018T22:40:23,Bgrmystr2,that was just a one-off
17-11-2018T22:40:26,Bgrmystr2,far as I recall
17-11-2018T22:41:07,BluePhantom90,"when Adelaide lifted the sword and stone, asking if it still counts as her bing king"
17-11-2018T22:41:37,Twokinds,Uh... I dunno
17-11-2018T22:41:43,Twokinds,"It's your sketch suggestion, does it count?"
17-11-2018T22:42:37,BluePhantom90,-shrugs- I think if the King could lift the sword and stone together it would. Besides Maddie pulls the sword out later
17-11-2018T22:42:52,Bgrmystr2,then it counts
17-11-2018T22:42:57,Bgrmystr2,you answered your own question
17-11-2018T22:44:58,CommanderTrace,to which mail can i send the music requests Tom ?
17-11-2018T22:45:01,Combak,"Careful Tom, giving people ""ownership"" of stuff is a bit dangerous."
17-11-2018T22:45:08,BluePhantom90,"I mean who would you fear more. The women swinging the sword of Kings, OR the Sword still in the stone being Swung by a Giant women"
17-11-2018T22:45:10,Combak,"twokinds@gmail.com, right?"
17-11-2018T22:45:30,Twokinds,All the sketch suggestions are 100% canon!
17-11-2018T22:45:50,FenceEqualizer,Busty dragons for all \o/
17-11-2018T22:46:03,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited:
17-11-2018T22:46:31,Combak,Yay for multiverses!
17-11-2018T22:46:49,Bgrmystr2,"lol combak, the lore of the sketches (bar the ones that ask tom for comic lore) belong to the suggestor"
17-11-2018T22:46:53,Bgrmystr2,it's always been that way
17-11-2018T22:47:30,BluePhantom90,Still want to see Nat in Basitin Guard armor when she was raised by King Adelaide and Nat meets Western raised Keith
17-11-2018T22:52:43,BluePhantom90,OH SHIT GUYS!!! Someone really built a flying Delorean!
17-11-2018T22:53:58,Bgrmystr2,no they didn't
17-11-2018T22:54:05,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't actually fly
17-11-2018T22:55:06,Bgrmystr2,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/someone-built-a-delorean-that-can-fly-and-its-for-sale
17-11-2018T22:55:16,Bgrmystr2,"""fly"" in quotes on the link"
17-11-2018T22:55:55,FenceEqualizer,As aawesome as that would be do you really want people flying in cars?
17-11-2018T22:56:08,Bgrmystr2,we have people flying in planes and helicopters.
17-11-2018T22:56:12,FenceEqualizer,People can barely drive regular cars XD
17-11-2018T22:56:23,Bgrmystr2,average people won't be flying cars
17-11-2018T22:56:35,Combak,Yet.
17-11-2018T22:56:53,Bgrmystr2,it'll be either automated or they'll go to learn how to properly navigate it at a school
17-11-2018T22:57:17,Bgrmystr2,"because most people couldn't fly themselves out of a paper bag, they don't know how any flight systems work"
17-11-2018T22:57:22,FenceEqualizer,People take test to learn how to properly drive. Doesn't stop them from crashing.
17-11-2018T22:57:24,Bgrmystr2,"pitch or yaw, none of that."
17-11-2018T22:57:25,FenceEqualizer,Hmm true
17-11-2018T22:57:36,FenceEqualizer,Got me there
17-11-2018T22:58:10,Bgrmystr2,"the difference is that people survive crashes cuz vehicles are just.. fundamentally less dangerous on the road if something goes bad and you can't fix it than, you know, an aircraft"
17-11-2018T22:58:16,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-11-2018T22:58:28,Bgrmystr2,which tend to do very gnarly things when impacting the ground
17-11-2018T22:59:02,Bgrmystr2,"so when normal people with no experience try to fly, they won't last long."
17-11-2018T22:59:14,Bgrmystr2,and then those who do know will be the only ones left :)
17-11-2018T23:01:58,FenceEqualizer,Can't wait for Flying car Uber then
17-11-2018T23:02:54,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I expect to see self-driving cars being the mass majority and making vehicles so much faster, more efficient, and less dangerous"
17-11-2018T23:03:03,Bgrmystr2,just need to get rid of .. you know.. everyone else xD
17-11-2018T23:04:22,FenceEqualizer,Well there's been a lot of push back to auto driving cars with all the accidents.
17-11-2018T23:04:43,FenceEqualizer,"Well can't say it's been a lot per say but still, controversy and all."
17-11-2018T23:05:36,Bgrmystr2,"the only reason self-driving cars have issues is really just people on the road not also being self-driving cars, and then system bugs"
17-11-2018T23:06:53,Bgrmystr2,"cuz a road filled with 100% driverless cars will be able to predict within inches of movement using simple science, math, geometry, etc"
17-11-2018T23:08:07,Bgrmystr2,"just like any software, it has bugs, but will cut down on fatalities tremendously"
17-11-2018T23:09:48,CommanderTrace,i sent you an email Tom i hope you like some songs
17-11-2018T23:11:15,Twokinds,ty
17-11-2018T23:12:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well. I‚Äôm alive. Unfortunately, I missed the stream and still have that headache"
17-11-2018T23:12:26,CommanderTimYT,:ptv-victory:
17-11-2018T23:13:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of music, did you ever look up that Weightless song?"
17-11-2018T23:15:03,CommanderTimYT,weightless?
17-11-2018T23:16:16,CommanderTimYT,Do you have an example song?
17-11-2018T23:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,That is the song. Weightless
17-11-2018T23:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,marconi union
17-11-2018T23:18:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Other than some subnautica stuff, it‚Äôs the only other tune I listen to that doesn‚Äôt have singing"
17-11-2018T23:20:38,CommanderTimYT,10 hours version xD I can't listen to it for that long :joy:
17-11-2018T23:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you need the basic video link
17-11-2018T23:23:01,CommanderTimYT,no xD i mean i cant listen that music 10 hours
17-11-2018T23:23:04,CommanderTimYT,:joy:
17-11-2018T23:25:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Mk
17-11-2018T23:29:55,CommanderTimYT,i going to bed now Good night Tom/ everybody:ptv-sleepy::ptv-greetings:

17-11-2018T23:31:04,FenceEqualizer,Night
17-11-2018T23:31:32,FenceEqualizer,Probably going to slip off too. Got a early dentist appointment. Have a good night all
