10-08-2018T00:01:11,KiaWolf,its like a big  furry pillow
10-08-2018T00:01:27,Gundurr,with the perfect fluffyness
10-08-2018T00:01:36,TomatoBasket,"I doubt many women with dog boyfriends would complain about them being too hairy. Like EA says, the extra hair is a FEATURE!"
10-08-2018T00:01:37,TheBeckoner,Man I just got a huge grissly piece in this chicken nuggo
10-08-2018T00:01:49,TheBeckoner,much distaste

10-08-2018T00:03:30,KiaWolf,its just to cute
10-08-2018T00:03:41,Gundurr,maximum cuteness achieved
10-08-2018T00:04:04,Mippy,"Well, since I got no sleep last night I'll be heading out. Might see you next Friday Sage. See you Sunday Tom. Bye guys."
10-08-2018T00:04:14,SageSaga,take care Mippy

10-08-2018T00:04:29,SageSaga,kids these days and their unhealthy attraction to Dog people is scary
10-08-2018T00:04:34,Bgrmystr2,the BOOOOOOP :ptv-ohmy:
10-08-2018T00:04:49,Gundurr,"Dogs are cute, so why not dog people?"
10-08-2018T00:04:56,KiaWolf,my  unhealthy  attraction to dnd is worse XD
10-08-2018T00:05:08,Gundurr,same
10-08-2018T00:05:32,Twokinds,Some people are cat people
10-08-2018T00:05:39,KiaWolf,...
10-08-2018T00:05:44,Gundurr,uhh
10-08-2018T00:05:45,TomatoBasket,"@SageSaga  Like you have never put your body up against an excessive mass of well-shampooed fur, muscle, and... *drooollllll*"
10-08-2018T00:05:47,KiaWolf,he looks reaaaally good XD;;;;;
10-08-2018T00:05:55,KiaWolf,*might be a fan already of catboy*
10-08-2018T00:06:14,TomatoBasket,is off in dream land of memories of softness
10-08-2018T00:06:19,Gundurr,lol
10-08-2018T00:06:25,Twokinds,Wow I just saved this for the first time just now
10-08-2018T00:06:38,Gundurr,"I love dogs, im really good with dogs"

10-08-2018T00:06:59,Alphawolf333,Risky buisness
10-08-2018T00:07:02,SageSaga,not a Dog no- Cats are better- they take care of themselves and their love is real unlike Dogs who only love out of obedience and biological imperatives to stay alive
10-08-2018T00:07:02,TomatoBasket,has had so many crashes on a regular basis
10-08-2018T00:07:13,BadFoMo,*You like to.
10-08-2018T00:07:25,KiaWolf,i ride fourwheelers and stuff so yes XD lol
10-08-2018T00:07:27,Gundurr,Dogs are kind
10-08-2018T00:07:32,TheBeckoner,Pig is best pet
10-08-2018T00:07:40,TheBeckoner,pig is smart and has real love
10-08-2018T00:07:49,Astroanimations,hi everyone
10-08-2018T00:07:54,BadFoMo,Yo.
10-08-2018T00:07:55,Gundurr,Dog is more smart than Cat
10-08-2018T00:08:05,KiaWolf,Dogs are brats.. specially small ones...
10-08-2018T00:08:11,TomatoBasket,@SageSaga  So you prefer to rub your body up against large muscled cat people for cuddles and soft warmth.
10-08-2018T00:08:18,Alphawolf333,"I own a small dog, and I agree with that"
10-08-2018T00:08:19,Gundurr,"Big Dogs, are good Dogs"
10-08-2018T00:08:25,TheBeckoner,pig is smartererest
10-08-2018T00:08:32,BadFoMo,What about CatDog People?
10-08-2018T00:08:34,SageSaga,Her name is Mihari so yes
10-08-2018T00:08:52,KiaWolf,@alphawolf333  i have a pomeranian  (myiconatm) she is a brat and a half
10-08-2018T00:08:56,TomatoBasket,has discovered things about sage.
10-08-2018T00:09:22,TomatoBasket,"Through the cuddle of large muscled fur-covered people, there can truly be world peace."
10-08-2018T00:09:42,Gundurr,large MASCLES are the best
10-08-2018T00:10:05,SageSaga,I also have an Oni in a maid outfit to cuddle up with
10-08-2018T00:10:31,Gundurr,Oni are Giants
10-08-2018T00:10:36,SageSaga,She's dancing in the bottom corner of my stream
10-08-2018T00:10:46,Gundurr,"oh, wait"
10-08-2018T00:10:52,Gundurr,got confused
10-08-2018T00:11:11,Gundurr,Demons are also Oni
10-08-2018T00:11:53,Bgrmystr2,"that's basckwards, Gundurr"
10-08-2018T00:12:04,SageSaga,hopefully next year i will also have a Dark Elf and a Nekomata too
10-08-2018T00:12:07,TomatoBasket,"Rem is TRRAGEDY, tho"
10-08-2018T00:12:09,Gundurr,Oni are Deoms also!!!
10-08-2018T00:12:14,Bgrmystr2,and I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate
10-08-2018T00:12:14,Gundurr,Demons*
10-08-2018T00:12:46,ferociousfox,Why is Nibbly a Mrs?
10-08-2018T00:12:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gender
10-08-2018T00:13:25,ferociousfox,is that the whole reason behind why shes mentioned as mrs?
10-08-2018T00:13:37,Gundurr,Because Tom said so
10-08-2018T00:13:51,KiTA,"Technically, Mrs. means she is married."
10-08-2018T00:13:52,Bgrmystr2,"Tom said so, and so it was."
10-08-2018T00:14:00,KiTA,Ms. Nibbly is the neutral one
10-08-2018T00:14:16,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall her being stated as Mrs
10-08-2018T00:14:18,Bgrmystr2,just Ms
10-08-2018T00:14:21,ferociousfox,check patreon
10-08-2018T00:14:29,TomatoBasket,Oni is Mrs Nibbly is married to Sythe
10-08-2018T00:14:36,TheBeckoner,yeah I thought she was married?
10-08-2018T00:14:41,TomatoBasket,Sorry. startyed typing and changed sentence halfway
10-08-2018T00:14:42,TheBeckoner,but he liked died or whatevber
10-08-2018T00:14:46,ferociousfox,"her tag is ""mrs nibbly"
10-08-2018T00:14:48,TomatoBasket,Mrs. nibly is married to Sythe
10-08-2018T00:14:59,Gundurr,NO
10-08-2018T00:15:01,TomatoBasket,That is why she is Mrs. and why they are OTP
10-08-2018T00:15:32,SageSaga,pretty sure in Modern English they dont care about Mrs or Ms
10-08-2018T00:15:45,Gundurr,oh people do care
10-08-2018T00:15:46,TomatoBasket,Modern English they do care.
10-08-2018T00:15:50,Bgrmystr2,a lot of people do care yes
10-08-2018T00:15:59,TomatoBasket,It is just a lot of younger people don;'t/.
10-08-2018T00:16:08,TheBeckoner,yeah pretty sure people tend to care
10-08-2018T00:16:15,TomatoBasket,"Perhaps in 60 years, but the tradition and definitions do matter currently"
10-08-2018T00:16:26,SageSaga,"No, Language evolves over time regardless of what they want"
10-08-2018T00:16:51,ferociousfox,"I was just going through all the sketched on patreon and noticed nobbley was always tagged as mrs, so i thought id ask since it seemed odd :/"
10-08-2018T00:16:55,TomatoBasket,"But language is formed by people. If people are still alive that use it a certain way, it will continue to be that way until they are dead."
10-08-2018T00:17:07,TomatoBasket,those people are still quite alive.
10-08-2018T00:17:13,Gundurr,yes
10-08-2018T00:17:28,SageSaga,that doesnt stop language from changing
10-08-2018T00:18:00,TomatoBasket,I never said it did. It still doesn't mean words change meaning in less than 20 years
10-08-2018T00:18:04,Gundurr,"no, but it does slow it down"
10-08-2018T00:18:09,SageSaga,we dont have to wait for Grandma Spell Check to kick the bucket to use a term differently
10-08-2018T00:18:37,TomatoBasket,"Well, we still shouldn't be so fast to change definitions of words."
10-08-2018T00:18:39,SageSaga,they totally do- these days a word can change its meaning in a week
10-08-2018T00:18:57,TomatoBasket,only when tied to significant and powerful events.
10-08-2018T00:19:16,SageSaga,not really
10-08-2018T00:19:32,SageSaga,unless you consider Social media to be a significant and powerful event
10-08-2018T00:19:32,TomatoBasket,When meaning is gained in the collective psyche of an entire population at the same time.
10-08-2018T00:19:36,TheBeckoner,I mean anything that happens in mass can change a word even if its pointless
10-08-2018T00:19:49,TheBeckoner,like mems
10-08-2018T00:19:53,TheBeckoner,memes*
10-08-2018T00:19:54,TomatoBasket,Indeed.
10-08-2018T00:19:57,TomatoBasket,Mass is important
10-08-2018T00:20:09,Tienduc2002,:ptv-excited:
10-08-2018T00:20:16,LannAF,I return
10-08-2018T00:20:17,LannAF,Kinda
10-08-2018T00:20:25,LannAF,Anything happen while I was dead?
10-08-2018T00:20:30,TomatoBasket,"Right now there is a push to make Mrs and Ms. obsolete terms. In the vastness of history, 60 years might as well be a blink of an eye."
10-08-2018T00:20:48,TomatoBasket,@LannAF everything.
10-08-2018T00:20:59,SageSaga,when i was in school we were told that Mrs and Ms were on their way out because some people prefer Mrs to Ms just because their name sounded better  using one or the other
10-08-2018T00:21:10,SageSaga,that was over 20 years ago
10-08-2018T00:21:15,Bgrmystr2,I don't see why to make them obsolete. they have a meaning and purpose
10-08-2018T00:21:21,Gundurr,and yet its still around today
10-08-2018T00:21:27,TomatoBasket,"Yes, but in my school they were very different and enforced. that was over 20 years ago, too"
10-08-2018T00:21:30,Gundurr,shocker
10-08-2018T00:21:33,TomatoBasket,We live in a transition period.
10-08-2018T00:22:03,SageSaga,Oh my god you people =_=
10-08-2018T00:22:22,TomatoBasket,"Societies rarely change overnight. This Ms Mrs thing will most likely need 60 more years before you get your way, Sage."
10-08-2018T00:22:40,LannAF,his way? wat.
10-08-2018T00:22:52,TomatoBasket,"Language changing, Lann"
10-08-2018T00:23:03,SageSaga,im not waiting for all of you to kick the bucket so people can use terms how they want
10-08-2018T00:23:28,TomatoBasket,I'm not going to die early so you can use terms how you want either.
10-08-2018T00:23:36,Gundurr,OH? But do you have the power to change a language? NO? didn't think so
10-08-2018T00:23:38,SageSaga,If Tom wants to call her Mrs - yall arent going to be forcing him to make a husband for her
10-08-2018T00:23:42,TomatoBasket,Language changes over the period of generations.
10-08-2018T00:24:03,TomatoBasket,@Sage Nibbly is married to Sythe. TRhis is OTP.
10-08-2018T00:24:05,SageSaga,god i dont know how much more of this idiocy i can take
10-08-2018T00:24:16,Gundurr,HAH!
10-08-2018T00:24:18,LannAF,I'm confused as to why this conversation is happening.
10-08-2018T00:24:33,TomatoBasket,"Sythe and Nibly Shipped with postage, dear."
10-08-2018T00:24:36,LannAF,so ima just talk about something different.
10-08-2018T00:24:42,Gundurr,"you are also part of this conversation here, SAGE. so you are included in this idiocy!"
10-08-2018T00:25:02,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
10-08-2018T00:25:05,SageSaga,no i just think I should ban you both and be a little bit happier
10-08-2018T00:25:19,TomatoBasket,You cannot stop FEDEX!
10-08-2018T00:25:58,LannAF,Does anyone else hope the haptic gloves for VR people were working on become commercialized at least within 5 years?
10-08-2018T00:26:05,LannAF,Or is it probably that stuff is going to get screwed over.
10-08-2018T00:26:10,LannAF,probable*
10-08-2018T00:26:39,TomatoBasket,"Lann, haptic gloves would more than likely need 20 more years of development before the first widespread prototypes come off the line."
10-08-2018T00:27:18,Gundurr,"haptic gloves are well on there way, we dont need to wait 20 yrs, at most, 5 yrs"
10-08-2018T00:27:21,LannAF,Eh? With what source?
10-08-2018T00:27:22,LannAF,Yeah.
10-08-2018T00:27:29,LannAF,"There's already haptic gloves made that work, and well."
10-08-2018T00:27:31,TheBeckoner,Vr is fun
10-08-2018T00:27:32,TomatoBasket,"The first Occulus rift wasn't that great, and VR today has tons of problems. The same will happen with haptic gloves. Once someone finds a cheap and safe way to do it that require no peripheral equipment, then it will happen."
10-08-2018T00:27:34,LannAF,Well at that*
10-08-2018T00:27:34,Alphawolf333,"Maybe 10 at most, depending on issues"
10-08-2018T00:27:49,Gundurr,"yeah, alpha"
10-08-2018T00:27:56,LannAF,I agree with that Alpha.
10-08-2018T00:28:03,LannAF,I'd love to have a glove with my vive
10-08-2018T00:28:15,Gundurr,I so want to try VR
10-08-2018T00:28:22,TomatoBasket,@ Alphawolf333  Gundurr - I say 20 for the proper ones to come off the line. 5 years for an expensive prototype.
10-08-2018T00:28:30,Gundurr,why?
10-08-2018T00:28:55,TomatoBasket,"@Gundurr plug and play, widespread industry supoport. Cross-platform compatibility, and availability."
10-08-2018T00:29:12,Gundurr,because 20 yrs ago Nintendo realeased a GARBAGE vr product?
10-08-2018T00:29:14,TomatoBasket,The first VR headsets failed often due to the lack of all those things
10-08-2018T00:29:44,LannAF,"You do realize that VR headsets are becoming increasingly more common and sought after, right?"
10-08-2018T00:29:47,TomatoBasket,"Gundurr, that was one of the issues, yes. they did not put enough money into development and hardware support."
10-08-2018T00:29:49,LannAF,And they're not bad as they are.
10-08-2018T00:30:13,LannAF,"As it stands, the current headsets people are primarily using are widespread and growing"
10-08-2018T00:30:17,SageSaga,i'll hold out for Nervgear
10-08-2018T00:30:23,Gundurr,"but look at what  we have today, then look at what there will be in the future. How can you say that gloves will come in 20 yrs, when we will have technology that will make the gloves viable in 5 to 10 yrs?"
10-08-2018T00:30:24,TomatoBasket,"@LannAF they are getting better, but I don't have one because they are still not widely affordable. Take cellphones as an example."
10-08-2018T00:30:25,ferociousfox,"alright, im sleepin"
10-08-2018T00:30:38,LannAF,I'm not talking about you.
10-08-2018T00:31:01,LannAF,Goodnight ferociousfox!
10-08-2018T00:31:19,TomatoBasket,"@Gundurr cellphones. I remember the first cellphones. 20 years ago they were expensive. Useful, but expensive and hard to get. 10 years ago, they got available, but were weak. then smart phones happened and now everyone has one."
10-08-2018T00:32:08,TheBeckoner,Cell Phones now are very buff
10-08-2018T00:32:10,Gundurr,"yes, but when you look at the rate at which technology is advancing, we can have gloves in 5 to 10 yrs"
10-08-2018T00:32:11,TomatoBasket,"Today, cellphones are widely supported across all platforms, locations, and have a wide range of applications, etc. they are a mature technology. VR is reaching the half way point. Haptic gloves are infant."
10-08-2018T00:33:03,TomatoBasket,"@Gundurr we can, and we will. However, by that time VR will have become something amazing that you cannot live without. Haptic will not be fully mature."
10-08-2018T00:33:25,TomatoBasket,It takes time to troubleshoot new tech that is supposed to be mounted to people.
10-08-2018T00:33:41,Gundurr,but they are literal gloves
10-08-2018T00:33:50,TomatoBasket,yeah. and VR is a literal headset.
10-08-2018T00:33:54,Gundurr,yes
10-08-2018T00:34:31,SageSaga,So Tomato- what's your degree in?
10-08-2018T00:34:33,TomatoBasket,"VR is still growing as an industry and they still have major problems. Children can't use them, and they take more processing power than your average computer can handle, and are a tad bit expensive to buy, keep, and operate."
10-08-2018T00:34:50,Gundurr,WOAH! Children cant use them!?
10-08-2018T00:34:51,LannAF,"So because you personally feel VR headsets aren't at a point where they're for consumers (which, again, they are right now. Regardless of growing)"
10-08-2018T00:35:05,LannAF,I've had my nephews use them.
10-08-2018T00:35:17,SageSaga,you Fool!
10-08-2018T00:35:19,Gundurr,Children love vr
10-08-2018T00:35:24,SageSaga,That will stunt their eyes!
10-08-2018T00:35:28,TomatoBasket,"@Gundurr they are designed for adults. Child eyes are not the same distance apart. some have adjustable lenses, but they were prototypes last I checked."
10-08-2018T00:35:31,LannAF,I don't know what you're even trying to reference aside from assumptions
10-08-2018T00:35:31,Gundurr,its something that is new and exciting
10-08-2018T00:35:46,Alphawolf333,Just like televisions!
10-08-2018T00:35:49,SageSaga,The Vive has adjustable lenses
10-08-2018T00:35:55,Gundurr,yes! thank you!
10-08-2018T00:35:56,LannAF,"Yeah, it's strange for me"
10-08-2018T00:36:08,LannAF,Idk how to adjust it despite following the instructions haha
10-08-2018T00:36:10,LannAF,but it works well
10-08-2018T00:36:12,TomatoBasket,So they are finally out @SageSaga
10-08-2018T00:36:17,SageSaga,For years- yes
10-08-2018T00:36:23,LannAF,also
10-08-2018T00:36:36,Gundurr,the vive has had adjustable lenses sinse they came out
10-08-2018T00:36:43,LannAF,Saying that the vive's price is restrictive is just as irrational as saying a new game console or computer is expensive
10-08-2018T00:37:04,TomatoBasket,The HTC Vive came out in 2016. we are in 2018
10-08-2018T00:37:09,Gundurr,yes
10-08-2018T00:37:13,Zakuru,"Okay folks, im heading to bed"
10-08-2018T00:37:16,SageSaga,years- yes
10-08-2018T00:37:22,SageSaga,night Zakuru
10-08-2018T00:37:24,Zakuru,"thanks for the stream Tom, Sage."
10-08-2018T00:37:26,LannAF,Goodnight Zakuru!
10-08-2018T00:37:28,Gundurr,"what point are you trying to make, tomato"
10-08-2018T00:37:29,Corinthian,I'm heading out too. G'night
10-08-2018T00:37:29,ZRO4825,G'night Zaku~
10-08-2018T00:37:30,Zakuru,Off to the moonrise festival &gt;w&lt;
10-08-2018T00:37:35,LannAF,Moonrise festival?
10-08-2018T00:37:36,LannAF,Wait
10-08-2018T00:37:37,TomatoBasket,"Well, until all the brands have adjustable lenses, my point still stands"
10-08-2018T00:37:40,LannAF,Where is that?
10-08-2018T00:37:45,Gundurr,all!?
10-08-2018T00:37:49,SageSaga,Tomato doesnt have a point- just a stance that wont be broken regardless of logic or proof
10-08-2018T00:38:00,TomatoBasket,Sage. please.
10-08-2018T00:38:07,Gundurr,"Tomato, Pleasde"
10-08-2018T00:38:09,TomatoBasket,I don't appreciate your hotile tone
10-08-2018T00:38:24,Gundurr,we dont like your acqusitions
10-08-2018T00:38:52,TomatoBasket,"Gundurr, we are discussing the development of technology over time./"
10-08-2018T00:39:01,Gundurr,yes
10-08-2018T00:39:03,Gundurr,we are
10-08-2018T00:39:03,Dadrobit,"""acqusitions"""
10-08-2018T00:39:10,SageSaga,and what qualifications are you bringing?
10-08-2018T00:40:09,TomatoBasket,"I am saying that it will take time for these technologies to mature, and VR is in the middle area. Like cellphones were 10 years ago. haptic gloves are similar to cellphones to 20 years ago."
10-08-2018T00:40:28,SageSaga,are you familiar with exponential growth?
10-08-2018T00:40:45,Gundurr,take cpu's for instance
10-08-2018T00:41:04,Alphawolf333,"Not to mention, as Haptic gloves would be an accessory to VR, it would accelerate as VR gains influence"
10-08-2018T00:41:07,Afallingtree,Did this chat get heated while I was gone or something?
10-08-2018T00:41:11,Gundurr,there transistor counts have Had HUGE growths
10-08-2018T00:41:13,Alphawolf333,Yes it did
10-08-2018T00:41:15,SageSaga,Yep
10-08-2018T00:41:23,Afallingtree,Damn I missed it
10-08-2018T00:41:26,LannAF,haha
10-08-2018T00:41:34,TomatoBasket,"Sage, I understand your point, but that does not account for the complexities surrpounding the specific technolgy."
10-08-2018T00:41:51,SageSaga,and what are your qualifications?
10-08-2018T00:41:53,LannAF,"Tomato, what is making you so well versed and educated in that?"
10-08-2018T00:41:54,Gundurr,accelerometers are a thing you know
10-08-2018T00:42:04,TomatoBasket,@ Gundurr and that goes to show you just how many transitors it takes to get a single prototype running
10-08-2018T00:42:06,LannAF,You're literally making SPECIFIC claims
10-08-2018T00:42:28,LannAF,with nothing to back it up other than you claiming it'll take a long time because it takes time.
10-08-2018T00:42:43,Alphawolf333,"There's already a tech prototype, that works well, with it's major flaw being size"
10-08-2018T00:42:44,TomatoBasket,@LannAF Everyone is saying we will have haptic gloves common place in 5-10 years. What makes all of them experts?
10-08-2018T00:42:54,LannAF,What makes you an expert?
10-08-2018T00:43:02,LannAF,I only asked if anyone hopes it'll come out in 5 years
10-08-2018T00:43:04,Gundurr,HAH!
10-08-2018T00:43:07,Bgrmystr2,lol what makes anyone here an expert? xD
10-08-2018T00:43:21,LannAF,I've not made a single claim.
10-08-2018T00:43:23,Gundurr,as we can texactly show it
10-08-2018T00:43:26,SageSaga,"Bgr, I am an expert in many things, look at my name"
10-08-2018T00:43:36,SageSaga,:P
10-08-2018T00:43:39,Gundurr,lol
10-08-2018T00:43:42,LannAF,Sage's advice is pretty sound if I'll be honest
10-08-2018T00:43:46,LannAF,He taught me to make a nuclear reactor.
10-08-2018T00:43:50,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, please xD"
10-08-2018T00:43:52,TomatoBasket,"@LannAF Well, I said that in 5 years, the most expensive protoypes would have come out. it would take 20 years for it to become readily available to everyone with all the tech matured."
10-08-2018T00:44:04,Gundurr,why?
10-08-2018T00:44:05,SageSaga,they already have prototypes
10-08-2018T00:44:11,Gundurr,exactly
10-08-2018T00:44:22,TomatoBasket,@SageSaga marketable prototypes
10-08-2018T00:44:25,LannAF,Commercial prototypes will be available in a very short timeframe with how much VR is gaining traction.
10-08-2018T00:44:29,SageSaga,then are they prototypes?
10-08-2018T00:44:32,Gundurr,oh? Marjketable?
10-08-2018T00:44:38,Sibernethy,Why are we having this conversation again?
10-08-2018T00:44:39,Afallingtree,Be is still very new
10-08-2018T00:44:47,LannAF,I just wanted to talk about VR man
10-08-2018T00:44:47,Afallingtree,*vr
10-08-2018T00:44:55,Alphawolf333,something something VR
10-08-2018T00:45:05,SageSaga,This guy gets it
10-08-2018T00:45:07,TomatoBasket,"@Gundurr As I said. Plug and play compatibility, cross-platform support, wide availability. You are talking many companies with many products."
10-08-2018T00:45:19,Gundurr,am I?
10-08-2018T00:45:40,SageSaga,=_= Plug and Play compatibility- it's called USB
10-08-2018T00:45:46,Gundurr,what about the EV2 controllers from valve? are they not called Knuckles for a reason?
10-08-2018T00:45:49,SageSaga,done
10-08-2018T00:45:51,SageSaga,next issue
10-08-2018T00:45:55,TomatoBasket,@SageSaga and programming. Software.
10-08-2018T00:46:10,SageSaga,yeah- you need that to run the prototype
10-08-2018T00:46:10,Gundurr,valve is working on that as we speak
10-08-2018T00:46:16,TomatoBasket,Mac and Windows. Consoles with prorietary software.
10-08-2018T00:46:21,SageSaga,you are bringing up non-issues
10-08-2018T00:46:43,Gundurr,where is all of the Linux love?
10-08-2018T00:46:47,TomatoBasket,"The competition to come out with an industry standard on how to decode haptic feedback and process it into info that can be read by any computer, etc."
10-08-2018T00:47:07,SageSaga,=_= we can already do that
10-08-2018T00:47:14,Gundurr,we HAVE done that
10-08-2018T00:47:21,TomatoBasket,"@SageSaga you say they are non-issues, but these are the issues the large companies need to overcome to make these things marketable. People with jobs need to DO that. it hasn't been done yet."
10-08-2018T00:47:23,Afallingtree,I do 3d modeling so I know hard it is to model for ver games
10-08-2018T00:47:36,SageSaga,it has been done!
10-08-2018T00:47:45,Afallingtree,*vr
10-08-2018T00:47:50,TomatoBasket,"If it was already done, Gundurr . Why don't we all have haptic gloves for 60$ yet?"
10-08-2018T00:47:56,TomatoBasket,takes time.
10-08-2018T00:48:05,SageSaga,Holy crap stop - you are terrible at this
10-08-2018T00:48:07,TomatoBasket,Hasn't been done because the products don't exist yet.
10-08-2018T00:48:17,ZRO4825,Because companies are greedy bastards and will milk high prices for as long as they can.
10-08-2018T00:48:22,TomatoBasket,Find me a 60$ set of haptic gloves compatible with my computer.
10-08-2018T00:48:31,TomatoBasket,Find me a 60$ headset.
10-08-2018T00:48:33,SageSaga,you havent brought up one good reason- there are reasons- but none that you mentioned!
10-08-2018T00:48:38,TomatoBasket,Find me a 60$ cellphone.
10-08-2018T00:48:47,ZRO4825,Exclusive items for the wealthy! And then eventually it trickles down to the masses at reduced prices.
10-08-2018T00:48:57,SageSaga,that's it- you are done- this is absurd
10-08-2018T00:49:00,Sibernethy,@TomatoBasket I don't know anything about VR or tech. All I know is that you're kind of in the hot seat right now.
10-08-2018T00:49:38,Afallingtree,....oh damn
10-08-2018T00:49:39,ZRO4825,"That was absurd. I went to newegg, looked up gaming headset. First thing in the list is $32.99."
10-08-2018T00:49:55,Gundurr,"a $60 cell phone, eh? take a look at thenokia 3310"
10-08-2018T00:49:56,SageSaga,if your goal is to make everything cost 60 bucks i want my electric car for 60 bucks
10-08-2018T00:50:18,Alphawolf333,Someone should have brought up Google's cardboard vr
10-08-2018T00:50:26,Gundurr,OH yeah!
10-08-2018T00:50:27,ZRO4825,"Oh, wait, he probably meant VR headset. Why the hell would those ever be $60? The screens alone cost more than that."
10-08-2018T00:50:34,Afallingtree,VR isn’t ready
10-08-2018T00:50:52,Afallingtree,I still do 3d modeling using polygons
10-08-2018T00:50:58,Gundurr,"I dunno, you could do some wacky stuff with regular controllers"
10-08-2018T00:51:01,Bgrmystr2,lolol.. cuz prices never come down on technology
10-08-2018T00:51:30,SageSaga,Bgr- where's my house for 60 dollars?! Houses arent real till they are 60 dollars!
10-08-2018T00:51:45,Gundurr,lol
10-08-2018T00:51:46,Alphawolf333,They aren't consumer ready!
10-08-2018T00:51:54,LannAF,oh I'm back and it's over
10-08-2018T00:51:57,LannAF,Neat!
10-08-2018T00:52:03,Afallingtree,Lol
10-08-2018T00:52:13,LannAF,"So I've been seeing some VRchat videos, these people have multiple sensors on them to have their entire bodies tracked"
10-08-2018T00:52:18,Bgrmystr2,"lolo, cuz a house is fair XD"
10-08-2018T00:52:20,LannAF,First thing they do:
10-08-2018T00:52:25,LannAF,Visit a stripclub.
10-08-2018T00:52:28,Gundurr,lol
10-08-2018T00:52:42,Afallingtree,"I’m still not sure what I walked into. Something about VR, headset for $60 and then someone got banned"
10-08-2018T00:52:42,LannAF,Though honestly there's a VRchat youtuber who does insane dancing
10-08-2018T00:52:44,LannAF,With the trackers
10-08-2018T00:52:51,SageSaga,well now i can forget this nonsense and check my script so i can go back to work
10-08-2018T00:53:09,Gundurr,"yay, no more nonsence!"
10-08-2018T00:53:09,LannAF,Like breakdancing and choreographed dancing
10-08-2018T00:53:14,LannAF,With other people
10-08-2018T00:53:21,LannAF,It's actually crazy how advanced VRchat is getting.
10-08-2018T00:53:30,Gundurr,its pretty impressive
10-08-2018T00:53:35,Afallingtree,As funny as that argument was I don’t like seeing too much salt in TK streams
10-08-2018T00:53:38,Bgrmystr2,"I found everyone's nonsense enjoyable, honestly"
10-08-2018T00:53:42,Bgrmystr2,was popcorn-demanding.
10-08-2018T00:53:48,Gundurr,lol
10-08-2018T00:53:49,Bgrmystr2,:popcorn::popcorn:
10-08-2018T00:53:55,Alphawolf333,It was pretty enjoyable to partake in
10-08-2018T00:53:58,LannAF,Honestly I only brought up VR because I wanted to talk about something fun
10-08-2018T00:54:08,LannAF,"When a fun topic gets dragged into the mud, that's not cool."
10-08-2018T00:54:14,Gundurr,then it turned into a flame war
10-08-2018T00:54:16,Alphawolf333,"and it spiraled down, like the previous topic"
10-08-2018T00:54:17,Tienduc2002,:ptv-laugh:
10-08-2018T00:54:17,Afallingtree,True
10-08-2018T00:54:19,Bgrmystr2,"wellllllll Lann, that's sometimes what happens here"
10-08-2018T00:54:24,SageSaga,the banning- was fate Lann
10-08-2018T00:54:30,Bgrmystr2,it is fairly normal
10-08-2018T00:54:32,Bgrmystr2,"rare, but normal"
10-08-2018T00:54:35,Gundurr,it was bound to happen
10-08-2018T00:54:43,LannAF,"Either way, let's move on."
10-08-2018T00:54:44,SageSaga,nothing you could do to stop it
10-08-2018T00:54:51,LannAF,I wasn't trying to stop it
10-08-2018T00:54:55,Gundurr,agreed
10-08-2018T00:54:55,LannAF,I just wanted to talk about stuff xD
10-08-2018T00:55:06,LannAF,But honestly
10-08-2018T00:55:08,Gundurr,so about that new DOOM ETERNAL gameplay...
10-08-2018T00:55:19,SageSaga,"i have a new Meme, the 60 dollar meme"
10-08-2018T00:55:22,LannAF,I feel like VRchat's success comes a lot from the fact people can have their anime waifus dance all over them.
10-08-2018T00:55:32,LannAF,which isn't bad mind you.
10-08-2018T00:55:34,BluePhantom90,Still plan to get that sketch idea sam tricked Collin into her room and Locks the door behinds her.
10-08-2018T00:55:34,Alphawolf333,Ah a great consumer meme!
10-08-2018T00:55:50,Bgrmystr2,"lool, at least it's rooted in reality, sage"
10-08-2018T00:55:50,Sibernethy,I wanted to give the guy a heads up about what I saw coming but it was too late
10-08-2018T00:55:55,Bgrmystr2,unlike other memes
10-08-2018T00:56:17,Gundurr,what about the pholseraptor?
10-08-2018T00:56:28,Gundurr,philoseraptor?*
10-08-2018T00:56:30,SageSaga,"""We have this new game and its only 70 dollars!"" ""Then its not ready for the public, its just a prototype, work on it more and sell it for 60"" ""Then- then it would cost more"" ""I HAVE SPOKEN!"""
10-08-2018T00:56:31,Sibernethy,Captain Sum Ting Wong
10-08-2018T00:56:46,Bgrmystr2,lol gundurr
10-08-2018T00:56:54,Bgrmystr2,itt outofcontext
10-08-2018T00:57:02,Gundurr,"lol, yep"
10-08-2018T00:57:09,ZRO4825,Everything is out of context if you work it right.
10-08-2018T00:57:10,LannAF,Tom that's such a cute picture
10-08-2018T00:57:13,ZRO4825,:csagesaga-c4:
10-08-2018T00:57:18,Bgrmystr2,"not everything zro, just some things"
10-08-2018T00:57:20,LannAF,Make more storiesss
10-08-2018T00:57:35,Bgrmystr2,gotta go out of yer way to do it
10-08-2018T00:57:47,Bgrmystr2,to do it by accident is impressive.
10-08-2018T00:57:54,Barrax,Hi
10-08-2018T00:57:59,Bgrmystr2,Hello
10-08-2018T00:58:01,Sibernethy,"Is it just me or do less and less people read and more people watch movies, videos, or read comics instead?"
10-08-2018T00:58:03,Afallingtree,Hey
10-08-2018T00:58:22,SageSaga,as a comic artist i hope so?
10-08-2018T00:58:23,Gundurr,"more people do those things, But I persoanlly prefer reading to other medai"
10-08-2018T00:58:39,Afallingtree,Well I never read many books in the first place
10-08-2018T00:58:44,Sibernethy,It's kind of bad for me since my strong suit is writing ^^;
10-08-2018T00:58:47,Alphawolf333,"It depends on my mood, though I would probably fall in the second"
10-08-2018T00:58:52,Sibernethy,But I prefer writing for a visual
10-08-2018T00:58:57,Afallingtree,I appreciate the art that goes alongside the story
10-08-2018T00:58:58,Sibernethy,So it kinda sorta works out
10-08-2018T00:59:03,SageSaga,write... comics
10-08-2018T00:59:11,Bgrmystr2,"Sib, it's true, but it's also understandable. Comics, movies, videos, and comics all give more visual stimuli than a full text story."
10-08-2018T00:59:15,SageSaga,or scripts - more money is in scripts
10-08-2018T00:59:27,Bgrmystr2,..I said comics twice :U
10-08-2018T00:59:30,Bgrmystr2,ignorethat
10-08-2018T00:59:34,ZRO4825,Can't ignore.
10-08-2018T00:59:36,Alphawolf333,No!
10-08-2018T00:59:44,Sibernethy,"I want to write for animation as that's my chosen career path, but comics, games, and stuff are also options"
10-08-2018T00:59:51,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-pouty: Ignore!
10-08-2018T00:59:52,Sibernethy,But I can't draw to save my life
10-08-2018T01:00:03,Ruth66,Hi everyone
10-08-2018T01:00:04,Gundurr,I prefer reading words and creating an image in my head about what is going on
10-08-2018T01:00:11,Bgrmystr2,hey Ruth

10-08-2018T01:00:30,ZRO4825,"Sorry, Bgr. Ignorance is bliss, and I'm nowhere near happy enough to be that ignorant. :V"
10-08-2018T01:00:38,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, Gundurr, but you'll never truly know."
10-08-2018T01:00:48,Sibernethy,And I'm too poor/broke to hire anyone to do the art
10-08-2018T01:00:50,Bgrmystr2,or so you say zro :V

10-08-2018T01:04:20,Sibernethy,Innuendo face
10-08-2018T01:04:20,Afallingtree,That can’t be explained
10-08-2018T01:04:22,Gundurr,"its Kapp, Lenny face is literally Kappa"
10-08-2018T01:04:30,Sibernethy,:ptv-kippi:

10-08-2018T01:05:27,ZRO4825,:csagesaga-c1:
10-08-2018T01:05:50,Afallingtree,TK needs an offical discord
10-08-2018T01:06:05,Bgrmystr2,you and many others feel the same
10-08-2018T01:06:22,ZRO4825,Ha. Nope.
10-08-2018T01:06:27,ZRO4825,Nope nope nope nope.

10-08-2018T01:06:51,LannAF,For what Afallingtree?
10-08-2018T01:07:10,Sibernethy,^ unintentional play on words
10-08-2018T01:07:11,Afallingtree,Updates n stuff
10-08-2018T01:07:16,Bgrmystr2,"lol, for ppl to congregate and talk about twokinds, probably, Lann"
10-08-2018T01:07:25,Bgrmystr2,not that that would go terribly or whatever..
10-08-2018T01:07:25,Afallingtree,I’m on my pc more than my phone
10-08-2018T01:07:25,ZRO4825,:joy:
10-08-2018T01:07:27,ZRO4825,:rofl:
10-08-2018T01:07:29,LannAF,haha Siber
10-08-2018T01:07:45,LannAF,There are avenues like the forums and such for that already isn't there?
10-08-2018T01:07:49,LannAF,Or the reddit
10-08-2018T01:08:08,Afallingtree,Oh true I forgot about reddit
10-08-2018T01:08:10,Bgrmystr2,You do know there's two unofficial discords for TK already right xD
10-08-2018T01:08:48,Bgrmystr2,neither reddit or the forums give proper real-time messaging
10-08-2018T01:08:57,Afallingtree,Exactly
10-08-2018T01:09:12,Afallingtree,That’s why I join these streams
10-08-2018T01:09:14,LannAF,Fair
10-08-2018T01:09:36,Afallingtree,And i can’t join comic page streams because I don’t want to spoil it
10-08-2018T01:09:50,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, this is a properly dank beat I must say."
10-08-2018T01:09:57,Bgrmystr2,yeah Dadro

10-08-2018T01:11:04,FluffKevlar,haha i didnt know there was a Vikna emote of that
10-08-2018T01:11:06,Gundurr,:ptv-confused:
10-08-2018T01:11:17,Sibernethy,"You guys are distracting me ;w;, I need to do research"
10-08-2018T01:11:22,Sibernethy,&lt;3
10-08-2018T01:11:24,Bgrmystr2,"lol fluff, you've seen it already"
10-08-2018T01:11:26,ZRO4825,I may have done some editing to create it after you put that AskARA out ^^; lol
10-08-2018T01:11:34,Bgrmystr2,cuz I remember zro showing it to you during a stream
10-08-2018T01:11:46,Bgrmystr2,I was there :U
10-08-2018T01:11:50,ZRO4825,"Hey, cut the man some slack, a lot of crap goes on during his streams. :P"
10-08-2018T01:11:57,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, but it happened!"
10-08-2018T01:12:06,FluffKevlar,i was also up til like 11am last night so im kind out of it
10-08-2018T01:12:21,ZRO4825,"Yeesh dude, get some sleep or somethin o_o"
10-08-2018T01:12:36,FluffKevlar,had to stay up to reach the post office to intercept a package before it was mailed cause the person gave me wrong address
10-08-2018T01:12:42,Alphawolf333,Ouch that hurts to read
10-08-2018T01:12:46,Bgrmystr2,"Also, @LannAF ""Official"" as slated to be ran by Tom or someone he trusts rather than random people within the community, Similar to the Katbox discord."
10-08-2018T01:12:47,Gundurr,sleeps
10-08-2018T01:13:03,ZRO4825,"Ouch, Fluff. That sucks. Hope ya got it at least?"
10-08-2018T01:13:05,Gundurr,are needed
10-08-2018T01:13:12,FluffKevlar,yeah i did actually
10-08-2018T01:13:18,FluffKevlar,i was kind of surprised
10-08-2018T01:14:44,LannAF,"The problem with public discords is that by joining one, anybody who is a part of one is capable of messaging you and sending/spamming things to you."
10-08-2018T01:15:00,FluffKevlar,no
10-08-2018T01:15:02,LannAF,"Which isn't a problem for most people, but for webcomic artists, it'd more than likely force them into blocking everyone except friends"
10-08-2018T01:15:03,FluffKevlar,you can turn that off
10-08-2018T01:15:11,Alphawolf333,That's why I lurk
10-08-2018T01:15:47,LannAF,"That's what I mean fluff, you'd only be able to filter it by friends, which means you'd have to go on ahead and add everybody except the ones in the public discord if you wanted the same functionality."
10-08-2018T01:16:12,Bgrmystr2,Tis why I don't really bother with ppl
10-08-2018T01:16:26,ZRO4825,Well floof you too then. :V
10-08-2018T01:16:40,Gundurr,people are exhasting
10-08-2018T01:16:44,Gundurr,in person
10-08-2018T01:16:47,LannAF,I like people!
10-08-2018T01:16:57,LannAF,But I respect it when people don't want to be pestered.
10-08-2018T01:17:06,SageSaga,I turned that off Lann
10-08-2018T01:17:14,SageSaga,so people cant message me like that
10-08-2018T01:17:17,Gundurr,lol
10-08-2018T01:18:20,SageSaga,Too many weirdos
10-08-2018T01:18:24,HorseBeast,"Yea, you hope people will have that common sense to not spam like a bot, but..."
10-08-2018T01:18:31,HorseBeast,EXACTLY ^
10-08-2018T01:18:31,SageSaga,thinking that i draw all the comics on the Katbox
10-08-2018T01:18:49,Akirameerkat,"did know tom stramed, I don;t even recognize what program that is"
10-08-2018T01:18:51,sunblaze,hi everyone
10-08-2018T01:18:57,Afallingtree,Hey

10-08-2018T01:19:09,LannAF,"Yeah, there will always be spammers and such."
10-08-2018T01:19:17,Akirameerkat,really
10-08-2018T01:19:30,SageSaga,"""Hey! How do you draw Rascals, Caribbean Blue, Las Lindas, The Eye, and Uber Quest?!"" ""I dont do any of those"""
10-08-2018T01:19:53,Akirameerkat,the best of the best
10-08-2018T01:20:02,Gundurr,do they not understand that you have your own comic
10-08-2018T01:20:12,FluffKevlar,some people arent smart
10-08-2018T01:20:19,ZRO4825,That's putting it lightly....
10-08-2018T01:20:26,Gundurr,agrred
10-08-2018T01:20:39,ZRO4825,"""Thanks for calling Domino's, would you like to hear our specials?"" ""No thanks. What's your specials today?""  &lt;_&gt;;;;;;;"
10-08-2018T01:21:03,Akirameerkat,"reminds me, I need to catch up on the comic"
10-08-2018T01:21:16,SageSaga,which one?
10-08-2018T01:21:20,Alphawolf333,"I've had slip ups like that, and I die on the inside"
10-08-2018T01:21:24,Akirameerkat,twokinds
10-08-2018T01:21:30,SageSaga,darn
10-08-2018T01:21:33,Gundurr,lol
10-08-2018T01:21:36,Gundurr,Sage
10-08-2018T01:22:18,Akirameerkat,"The way he as it set up, I couldn't even tell that was photoshop"
10-08-2018T01:22:44,Gundurr,im pretty sure its illustrator
10-08-2018T01:22:50,SageSaga,it isnt
10-08-2018T01:22:51,Gundurr,but I could be wrong
10-08-2018T01:22:56,Alphawolf333,"no, it's photoshop"
10-08-2018T01:22:59,SageSaga,he uses Photoshop
10-08-2018T01:23:00,Gundurr,ok
10-08-2018T01:23:06,Akirameerkat,"I know its one of those I can't get, I use Sai and Krita myself"
10-08-2018T01:23:12,Afallingtree,He had it setup so you could see the tools on the side of the screen back in the early days
10-08-2018T01:23:49,Akirameerkat,"I just found out he streamed when I logged in, and he is right on the front"
10-08-2018T01:24:24,SageSaga,I also am on the front!
10-08-2018T01:24:32,Afallingtree,Yeah because soon as he starts streaming it automatically had the most ppl waiting
10-08-2018T01:24:36,HorseBeast,They actually have a damn good deal for Adobe at 20/30 a month for the whole suite. Worth it if you wear multiple hats...or just like having lots of hats
10-08-2018T01:24:50,Afallingtree,*watching
10-08-2018T01:24:50,Gundurr,all of the hats'
10-08-2018T01:25:04,FluffKevlar,Tom
10-08-2018T01:25:21,Akirameerkat,"I can't afford that, I make $11 per hour and pay mortagage, might be fired tomarrow, don't kknow"
10-08-2018T01:25:27,ZRO4825,"Huh, they changed the front page since last I checked it. Neat."
10-08-2018T01:25:46,Twokinds,Fluff
10-08-2018T01:25:54,FluffKevlar,i meant to mention before
10-08-2018T01:26:04,FluffKevlar,my patreon pinup this month is Mike
10-08-2018T01:26:15,Twokinds,:O

10-08-2018T01:26:32,Akirameerkat,"its interesting seeing you here fluff, since your such an amazing artist too"
10-08-2018T01:26:37,FluffKevlar,she's surprisingly hard to draw haha
10-08-2018T01:26:42,FluffKevlar,ah thanks!
10-08-2018T01:26:42,SageSaga,What about me?
10-08-2018T01:26:43,Bgrmystr2,is it gonna be standard mike or Femmike?
10-08-2018T01:26:52,Afallingtree,Did I miss something?
10-08-2018T01:26:59,FluffKevlar,Sage is a good artist! and writer
10-08-2018T01:27:04,FluffKevlar,femMike

10-08-2018T01:27:20,Bgrmystr2,poor normal mike.. no love for the dude :(
10-08-2018T01:27:20,FluffKevlar,but im doing my best
10-08-2018T01:27:20,Akirameerkat,"I wish I ciuld draw pinups, but I am bad at human anatomy"
10-08-2018T01:27:24,Twokinds,I figured XD
10-08-2018T01:27:31,Afallingtree,Fluff can you link me to your stuff
10-08-2018T01:27:33,sunblaze,age = sage. and I swear that pun was NOT intended.....
10-08-2018T01:27:56,Akirameerkat,"then again, my fans aren't interested in Pinups"
10-08-2018T01:27:58,SageSaga,My ego needs a boost sometimes Sunblaze
10-08-2018T01:28:11,sunblaze,fair enough
10-08-2018T01:28:35,FluffKevlar,"if you go to my picarto page, my links are below the stream. most are nsfw"
10-08-2018T01:29:16,Akirameerkat,"every time I draw a pinup, they get 0 favorites"
10-08-2018T01:29:24,SageSaga,yeah- Fluff knows he cannot link stuff here without permission - and certainly not NSFW stuff
10-08-2018T01:29:28,Afallingtree,Oh kk
10-08-2018T01:29:35,Deciem,hello
10-08-2018T01:29:41,Gundurr,Beautiful Page
10-08-2018T01:29:48,SageSaga,i have memory of Deciem
10-08-2018T01:30:04,Deciem,fluff kevlar is very findable from google
10-08-2018T01:30:10,Akirameerkat,of FA
10-08-2018T01:30:11,Deciem,hello sage
10-08-2018T01:30:20,Akirameerkat,OR fa
10-08-2018T01:30:27,ZRO4825,I just follow his patreon. Makes everything easier to find. :3
10-08-2018T01:30:54,Bgrmystr2,There's this awesome thing called whispers
10-08-2018T01:31:02,ZRO4825,Lies.
10-08-2018T01:31:03,Bgrmystr2,a bit advanced for some ppl tho
10-08-2018T01:31:07,Bgrmystr2,:v
10-08-2018T01:31:09,Deciem,WHAT?
10-08-2018T01:31:20,sunblaze,does not work 100% of the time however. picarto just being dumb
10-08-2018T01:31:39,Deciem,this is a perfect website what are you talking about
10-08-2018T01:31:41,SageSaga,i thought whispers only fail due to user error?
10-08-2018T01:31:43,Akirameerkat,"I wish I could stream, but with a 1.5 ghz , and 16 mpbs internet, its a no go"
10-08-2018T01:31:51,Alphawolf333,I'm not a fan of picarto's whispers
10-08-2018T01:32:14,sunblaze,last week they failed with correct uses as well. might have been some kind of bug
10-08-2018T01:32:17,Deciem,Twitch has a somewhat better implimentation of whispers
10-08-2018T01:32:29,sunblaze,only thing that worked 100% of the time was an extra tab with the person
10-08-2018T01:33:19,Bgrmystr2,"Not always, sage. Sometimes you click on name, type somethin to whisper, and it goes to all chat anyway"
10-08-2018T01:33:29,Bgrmystr2,"even with the /whisper, it just disappears"
10-08-2018T01:33:49,Akirameerkat,anyway going to google why human anatomy is so hard to draw
10-08-2018T01:33:53,SageSaga,isnt that usually if that person has whispers disabled?
10-08-2018T01:34:13,Bgrmystr2,Naw
10-08-2018T01:34:25,Bgrmystr2,cuz it happens even if you're whispering someone. Sometimes it just fails
10-08-2018T01:34:29,Deciem,it goes to the main chat if the recipient's whispers are turned off?
10-08-2018T01:34:34,Bgrmystr2,no Deciem xD
10-08-2018T01:34:34,Deciem,that sounds... problematic
10-08-2018T01:34:39,Bgrmystr2,they just don't send
10-08-2018T01:34:47,Bgrmystr2,I've tried whispering someone that blocked me once
10-08-2018T01:34:55,Bgrmystr2,it just makes the message disappear
10-08-2018T01:35:03,Twokinds,"It's getting late, I think I'm finished for now"
10-08-2018T01:35:04,Deciem,"well, then it is working as intended"
10-08-2018T01:35:07,Bgrmystr2,you press ender and your message sends and nothing happens.
10-08-2018T01:35:14,Gundurr,okey dokey
10-08-2018T01:35:17,Deciem,although clearing the text buffer is probably not ideal
10-08-2018T01:35:20,SageSaga,bye Tom thanks for joining me
10-08-2018T01:35:20,Bgrmystr2,"so it's not the blocking thing, it's just the whisper thing that sometimes failed"
10-08-2018T01:35:30,Bgrmystr2,"thanks for streamin tom, This image is lookin cute :D"
10-08-2018T01:35:30,ZRO4825,Have a g'night Tom

10-08-2018T01:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you ever get that pizza yesterday?
10-08-2018T01:40:36,Twokinds,Yes...
10-08-2018T01:41:30,Twokinds,Regret it now.
10-08-2018T01:41:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Same
10-08-2018T01:42:23,DarthRexKing,What happened?
10-08-2018T01:42:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d meant to get a veggie or Hawaiian. Ended up with a cheese
10-08-2018T01:42:57,Dadrobit,How does a pizzaria screw up Hawaiian into Cheese?
10-08-2018T01:43:02,LannAF,You didn't regret the birthday cake at least!
10-08-2018T01:43:05,LannAF,"....Well, too much."
10-08-2018T01:43:11,sunblaze,^:P
10-08-2018T01:43:15,Twokinds,They're both yellow
10-08-2018T01:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"If he’s still on that diet, it was cheat day. Otherwise I’d say hound dog syndrome or heartburn"
10-08-2018T01:43:47,LannAF,I really really want to visit Flip Burger boutique again.
10-08-2018T01:43:47,Twokinds,"Well, I ate the whole pizza in one sitting"
10-08-2018T01:43:51,LannAF,how.
10-08-2018T01:43:55,LannAF,HOW.
10-08-2018T01:43:59,DarthRexKing,Lol. Hungry you are.
10-08-2018T01:44:01,sunblaze,well atleast you did not take a pizza chicago-style with like 5 pounds of cheese
10-08-2018T01:44:02,DarthRexKing,were.
10-08-2018T01:44:03,SpazztasticKiwi,What the hell
10-08-2018T01:44:09,sunblaze,thats diet-overkill
10-08-2018T01:44:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats easy Lann, rage"
10-08-2018T01:44:14,Twokinds,Had quite the regretti Pizza-get...i
10-08-2018T01:44:21,Dadrobit,Any pizza is a personal pizza if you're dedicated enough.
10-08-2018T01:44:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Indigestion much? Did you even taste it?
10-08-2018T01:44:23,ZRO4825,I used to eat a whole pizza every time I got one &lt;_&lt;;;
10-08-2018T01:44:33,Twokinds,"That's a great face, Sage"
10-08-2018T01:44:52,LannAF,Tom you're wonderful.
10-08-2018T01:44:53,SageSaga,ty Tom
10-08-2018T01:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though as for me, they didn’t mess it up, I just changed my mind and got a different kind"
10-08-2018T01:45:02,Twokinds,"""I once caught a fish thiiiis big"""
10-08-2018T01:45:07,LannAF,LOL

10-08-2018T01:45:24,LannAF,"Btw, idk if I told you"
10-08-2018T01:45:42,LannAF,I told Sticky the serengetti joke and she laughed in an exasperated way
10-08-2018T01:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Bless your heart
10-08-2018T01:45:48,TorqueEmUp,"Depends on the size of the pizza, if it was a medium or larger. Oof. Too much pizza."
10-08-2018T01:45:49,Twokinds,:D
10-08-2018T01:45:53,LannAF,Plus the strip club picture.
10-08-2018T01:45:56,Twokinds,Haha
10-08-2018T01:45:59,LannAF,It was great visiting that strip club together Tom
10-08-2018T01:46:04,LannAF,We should go again next time xD
10-08-2018T01:46:07,DarthRexKing,Have a goodnight everyone.
10-08-2018T01:46:09,Twokinds,yeah
10-08-2018T01:46:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nani?
10-08-2018T01:46:14,SageSaga,I cant believe you took him to that strip club Tom
10-08-2018T01:46:16,LannAF,Is the steak there actually good?
10-08-2018T01:46:16,SageSaga,hes just a kid
10-08-2018T01:46:18,LannAF,wow
10-08-2018T01:46:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Tf
10-08-2018T01:46:21,LannAF,no I'm not
10-08-2018T01:46:23,LannAF,and RUDE.
10-08-2018T01:46:31,FluffKevlar,yeah
10-08-2018T01:46:33,SageSaga,Adults are speaking Lann
10-08-2018T01:46:38,LannAF,wow
10-08-2018T01:46:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"well then, time to start censoring my self around Lann"
10-08-2018T01:46:46,LannAF,NO.
10-08-2018T01:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never heard of much actual eating going on at a strip club
10-08-2018T01:46:57,LannAF,I'm not a kid goddamnit
10-08-2018T01:47:04,LannAF,Haha Kiwi
10-08-2018T01:47:06,SageSaga,saying that only makes it seem more true
10-08-2018T01:47:06,Mihari,Can you drink?
10-08-2018T01:47:15,TorqueEmUp,He's grouchy because it's way past his bed time.
10-08-2018T01:47:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Technically everyone can
10-08-2018T01:47:34,LannAF,"When Tom took me to comic con we were walking around trying to find a place to eat, he asked if I wanted to go to The Strip Club, and I was like ""what??"""
10-08-2018T01:47:35,SpazztasticKiwi,But that’s where “legally” pops in
10-08-2018T01:47:47,TorqueEmUp,:P
10-08-2018T01:47:49,LannAF,"Then he showed me a place called ""The Strip Club (A steak place)"""
10-08-2018T01:47:54,SpazztasticKiwi,That sounds about how I’d react
10-08-2018T01:47:58,LannAF,Yeah haha
10-08-2018T01:48:08,LannAF,He told me to take a picture and send it to my gf saying he took me to one
10-08-2018T01:48:17,LannAF,Her reaction was pretty great
10-08-2018T01:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,What the hell am I gonna do at a strip club?
10-08-2018T01:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I got the same stuff as being shown
10-08-2018T01:48:45,Twokinds,What does anyone do at a strip club?
10-08-2018T01:48:45,Dadrobit,Enjoy the culture?
10-08-2018T01:48:51,LannAF,Get lapdances usually.
10-08-2018T01:48:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,*blinks rapidly*
10-08-2018T01:48:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Enjoy the scenery
10-08-2018T01:48:57,LannAF,Or just drink and hang out.
10-08-2018T01:49:04,TorqueEmUp,"enjoy the show, and drink overpriced alchohol."
10-08-2018T01:49:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you can do that at car shows tho lann
10-08-2018T01:49:14,Dadrobit,Maybe have some wings.
10-08-2018T01:49:15,LannAF,me and sticky wanted to go to one during our last visit but we decided against that.
10-08-2018T01:49:23,LannAF,and just spent the day in bed
10-08-2018T01:49:24,FluffKevlar,Bernal told me to go to a strip club and just sketch the dancers
10-08-2018T01:49:27,SpazztasticKiwi,But the cars aren’t trying to crawl in your lap
10-08-2018T01:49:27,LannAF,Better decision
10-08-2018T01:49:28,FluffKevlar,"for poses, etc"
10-08-2018T01:49:35,Bgrmystr2,"I remember that, fluff"
10-08-2018T01:49:35,FluffKevlar,ive yet to try that out lol
10-08-2018T01:49:41,Bgrmystr2,you haven't yet?
10-08-2018T01:49:42,ZRO4825,lol
10-08-2018T01:49:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Nor do they have things to shove dollars in
10-08-2018T01:49:43,Bgrmystr2,go w/ Rei rofl
10-08-2018T01:49:46,SageSaga,every time i left a strip club someone tried to hit me with a car or  the cops  were after us
10-08-2018T01:49:55,Dadrobit,I fell like that's would be seen as too~ creepy.
10-08-2018T01:50:00,LannAF,Someone tried blowing me up inside it
10-08-2018T01:50:08,SageSaga,is that even possible?
10-08-2018T01:50:35,SpazztasticKiwi,You can’t hold your liquor...?
10-08-2018T01:50:36,SageSaga,i thought weapons were disabled in the strip clubs
10-08-2018T01:50:54,LannAF,Emphasis on try
10-08-2018T01:51:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d go to a club with friends or out of pure curiosity but I don’t drink and there’s not much else there that’d interest me
10-08-2018T01:51:36,LannAF,I needa remember to upload the comic-con image album
10-08-2018T01:51:47,Dadrobit,Lighting is getting super intense/close outside. Power might be going out...
10-08-2018T01:51:48,LannAF,I only wanted to go because my gf was curious as to what a lapdance would be like
10-08-2018T01:51:51,Deciem,You can watch pole dancers on the internet
10-08-2018T01:51:57,LannAF,But she didn't really want to go badly enough to pay that much money.
10-08-2018T01:52:08,LannAF,not worth
10-08-2018T01:52:18,Deciem,"but you have some cash to throw around on booze and dancers, go out and have fun"
10-08-2018T01:52:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh
10-08-2018T01:52:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Internet is cheaper
10-08-2018T01:52:44,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
10-08-2018T01:53:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Or better yet - go on a date night
10-08-2018T01:55:43,LannAF,That's basically what we did lol.
10-08-2018T01:55:48,TorqueEmUp,:ctorqueemup-natanisleep:
10-08-2018T01:56:07,LannAF,I'd rather take her on 2-3 dates than one stripclub visit
10-08-2018T01:56:44,TorqueEmUp,ofc
10-08-2018T02:02:15,LannAF,I'm glad I live in Vegas though.
10-08-2018T02:02:25,LannAF,Plenty of options of where to go.
10-08-2018T02:05:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Date better than club. For one you can actually hear each other
10-08-2018T02:10:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but if the date sucks, then you still have to listen to them."
10-08-2018T02:11:03,SpazztasticKiwi,The whole concept of a date is to see if you like spending time with them
10-08-2018T02:11:45,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and if it goes terribly, you have the fallback."
10-08-2018T02:11:50,SpazztasticKiwi,If they end up having the personality of a wet paper bag you can always say your mom texted for you when you get up and go to the bathroom
10-08-2018T02:12:01,SageSaga,Lann
10-08-2018T02:12:58,Dadrobit,"And if it goes poorly at a regular restaurant, you still have to listen to her drone on all about how the American railroad system was ACTUALLY made by the Mayans."
10-08-2018T02:12:59,SpazztasticKiwi,That hair though. 🔥
10-08-2018T02:13:11,Dadrobit,Fucking Tristana
10-08-2018T02:13:31,unsteddyphoenix,Oh hey~
10-08-2018T02:13:40,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s slightly concerning. What kind of girls you picking up?
10-08-2018T02:13:42,Dadrobit,o/ unsteddy
10-08-2018T02:13:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,UNsteddy you miss'ed the wrong
10-08-2018T02:14:11,unsteddyphoenix,...goooood?
10-08-2018T02:14:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,very
10-08-2018T02:15:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve never been to an actual sit date. I’ve gone to a carnival date, a run around town date, and a cookout date"
10-08-2018T02:15:20,sunblaze,cookout date? sounds jummy
10-08-2018T02:15:30,Dadrobit,Coffee and cake.
10-08-2018T02:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Not done one of those
10-08-2018T02:15:53,Dadrobit,"Or, like, Boba Tea and cake if they're not compatible with me."
10-08-2018T02:16:25,LannAF,"sorry Sage, what's up"
10-08-2018T02:16:26,LannAF,?
10-08-2018T02:16:35,SageSaga,it's too late- the damage is done
10-08-2018T02:16:39,LannAF,wat
10-08-2018T02:16:55,LannAF,???
10-08-2018T02:16:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Girl: *orders Boba tea* Dadro: “bye”
10-08-2018T02:16:59,sunblaze,he probably is in the mood for coffee and cake :D
10-08-2018T02:17:06,SageSaga,now i'll never be able to get my 60 dollar VR set and system
10-08-2018T02:18:33,LannAF,Some people don't understand that.
10-08-2018T02:18:58,SageSaga,i cant afford that
10-08-2018T02:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the fun dates - when you can get *really* weird with each other
10-08-2018T02:19:25,LannAF,"Kiwi, you have no clue how much I understand that comment haha"
10-08-2018T02:19:28,LannAF,You're super right
10-08-2018T02:19:41,LannAF,"When you're maximum comfortable with someone, things get...weird"
10-08-2018T02:19:53,SageSaga,the last date i went on got really weird
10-08-2018T02:19:58,LannAF,how so
10-08-2018T02:20:04,LannAF,I'm assuming not in the comfortable way
10-08-2018T02:20:19,SageSaga,well she started eating the waiter and sprouted locus wings
10-08-2018T02:20:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like “talking about your future kids” weird, or..."
10-08-2018T02:20:27,LannAF,oh jesus
10-08-2018T02:20:30,LannAF,That's pretty weird yeah.
10-08-2018T02:20:39,Dadrobit,I feel like that's a fever dream
10-08-2018T02:20:47,SageSaga,im just glad she was able to come out to me so honestly about being a locus person
10-08-2018T03:20:01,sunblaze,clearly everyone should have c cups after age of 16 no matter the gender.......
10-08-2018T03:20:24,sunblaze,it's like with the dwarves and their beard. good luck finding out!
10-08-2018T03:22:08,SageSaga,Dwarves were a mistake
10-08-2018T03:23:42,sunblaze,so no dwarves in AI?
10-08-2018T03:23:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Id  normally argue, but my chara was killed by a dwarf in dnd today"
10-08-2018T03:24:12,unsteddyphoenix,So im somewhat salty
10-08-2018T03:24:14,SageSaga,im talking about Lord of the Rings Lore ^^
10-08-2018T03:24:27,Bgrmystr2,lol..
10-08-2018T03:24:36,Bgrmystr2,"out of left field there, sage"
10-08-2018T03:24:38,SageSaga,The god who created them was just jealous and didnt have permission to create a race but did it anyways
10-08-2018T03:24:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My Silmarillion
10-08-2018T03:24:50,SageSaga,so they dont have souls
10-08-2018T03:24:54,SageSaga,and no afterlife
10-08-2018T03:25:07,SageSaga,only one Dwarf has ever gone to an afterlife
10-08-2018T03:25:15,unsteddyphoenix,Gimli?
10-08-2018T08:45:53,Nekonny,"or rather, untrained"
10-08-2018T08:46:00,Nekonny,I need to get a few tips from you
10-08-2018T08:46:17,TomatoBasket,the though?
10-08-2018T08:48:26,Nekonny,though
10-08-2018T08:49:08,TomatoBasket,I am too sleepy to understand
10-08-2018T08:49:36,Nekonny,go to bed :ptv-sleepy:
10-08-2018T08:49:43,LittleNapoleon,"happy to help if i can, but the way you do backgrounds fits pretty well with your style as is!"
10-08-2018T08:49:55,TomatoBasket,"I need to wait until afternoon because if I go to bed now, I sleep all day and wake up at night again"
10-08-2018T08:49:58,TomatoBasket,need to stop it.
10-08-2018T08:50:08,TomatoBasket,trying to stay awake until right bed time.
10-08-2018T08:52:46,Pimsan,Make sure yo take a good nap.
10-08-2018T08:54:38,TomatoBasket,I will. when the time comes. :)
10-08-2018T08:58:37,GreybowFalcona,Nice lil ? As she looks at the tail :p
10-08-2018T09:01:40,TomatoBasket,"adorable picture, that one"
10-08-2018T09:01:42,Nekonny,I guess the sort of help I need is mostly with color selection
10-08-2018T09:01:49,Nekonny,or understanding it
10-08-2018T09:03:14,TomatoBasket,"hmmm... I like it, though. I can't see what would be wrong with this."
10-08-2018T09:03:33,LittleNapoleon,"one thing that might be handy is to put an overlay that makes everything desaturated, black and white"
10-08-2018T09:04:04,LittleNapoleon,"and you can use that to choose where you want your bright and dark colors, to create contrast in areas where you want shapes to be defined and the eye to be drawn"
10-08-2018T09:04:41,LittleNapoleon,"for instance, a dark color behind your character would help her light color stand out more and draw the eye to her ^^"
10-08-2018T09:05:45,Nekonny,Hum
10-08-2018T09:06:16,Nekonny,Not sure I got the overlay technique
10-08-2018T09:07:31,LittleNapoleon,"oh, by overlay, i just mean a Saturation correction layer set to fully desaturate"
10-08-2018T09:07:49,LittleNapoleon,just something to toggle on and off to help the eye see where thelights and dark are
10-08-2018T09:08:06,LittleNapoleon,"kind of like flipping a picture horizontally, just a checking exercise ^^"
10-08-2018T09:09:44,Nekonny,"oh, so a layer that turns everything greyscale?"
10-08-2018T09:09:49,LittleNapoleon,yeah!
10-08-2018T09:10:38,Nekonny,I dont think SAi has that? at least not as somethign you can turn on/off...
10-08-2018T09:10:39,Nekonny,but
10-08-2018T09:10:44,Nekonny,I think I can emulate it
10-08-2018T09:12:47,TomatoBasket,"Perhaps if you make one layer grayscale and the rest in color, you can turn the layer itself on and off."
10-08-2018T09:12:53,TomatoBasket,That is what I do with my pictures.
10-08-2018T09:12:56,LittleNapoleon,yeah that looks about right!
10-08-2018T09:12:57,TomatoBasket,"For the shading, anyhoo."
10-08-2018T09:13:03,LittleNapoleon,https://www.dropbox.com/s/s259oruua9cm9k0/Capture.PNG?dl=0
10-08-2018T09:13:09,Nekonny,yeah but I would have to recreate it every time I wanted to do the check
10-08-2018T09:13:31,LittleNapoleon,"aw, bummer"
10-08-2018T09:13:33,TomatoBasket,Sai doesn't have a hide layer function?
10-08-2018T09:14:11,Nekonny,but it wouldnt update when I made changes
10-08-2018T09:14:15,TomatoBasket,Oh
10-08-2018T09:14:42,Nekonny,"So LN, how would I cange the contrast without changing the background elements?"
10-08-2018T09:15:30,LittleNapoleon,"All color is relative, so you can just change the values without changing the hue, or select a color that impacts the value"
10-08-2018T09:16:05,LittleNapoleon,"and just a note about the notes on that screencap, the rule of thumb is that you want high contrast where you want the eye to be drawn, so areas like the sign and character might be good candidates!"
10-08-2018T09:16:54,TomatoBasket,"This is useful to know for my pictures, now that I think about it."
10-08-2018T09:17:01,LittleNapoleon,"(i've gotta duck out for some errands, but hopefully that helps a bit!)"
10-08-2018T09:17:16,LittleNapoleon,(see ya in a while if you're still on!  looks great so far!)
10-08-2018T09:18:08,Tharkis,rawr

10-08-2018T14:03:12,SageSaga,im awake! i think
10-08-2018T14:06:11,sunblaze,well you are streaming unless your hand sleepwalks and draws while you nap
10-08-2018T14:06:12,Pimsan,You mean your half asleep?
10-08-2018T14:07:19,SageSaga,how can i tell if you are all just a dream though?
10-08-2018T14:07:44,sunblaze,you can not. might all be the matrix
10-08-2018T14:07:47,FoxxTrotter,You don't. ;0P
10-08-2018T14:08:48,Pimsan,Plot twist.
10-08-2018T14:10:17,sunblaze,plot twist in real sage is a hidden billionare that has no art talent but buttloads of money. and when he sleeps he becomes a giftes artist that has NOT all the medias attention he has
10-08-2018T14:11:30,MatyMaty,Sage is secretly Elon Musk?
10-08-2018T14:11:46,sunblaze,naw he is to nice for that
10-08-2018T14:11:54,FoxxTrotter,"Ey'dere, Maty."
10-08-2018T14:12:01,MatyMaty,o/
10-08-2018T14:12:32,SageSaga,if i were secretly Elon i wouldnt make retarded tweets and i would be directing an AI anime
10-08-2018T14:12:54,MatyMaty,XD
10-08-2018T14:13:10,MatyMaty,no Yosh! anime?
10-08-2018T14:13:18,SageSaga,the world isnt ready
10-08-2018T14:13:23,sunblaze,:P
10-08-2018T14:14:09,Pimsan,Or a crossover with Sword Art Online?
10-08-2018T14:14:24,SageSaga,never
10-08-2018T14:14:28,SageSaga,screw SAO
10-08-2018T14:14:35,Pimsan,Okay.
10-08-2018T14:14:37,MatyMaty,"Beat me to it, Sage :P"
10-08-2018T14:15:35,SageSaga,SAO stole from a book that came out long before it and then when it realized it had to separate itself it made a terrible villain and plot point
10-08-2018T14:16:00,sunblaze,well you do not SAO for the plot
10-08-2018T14:16:05,sunblaze,jsut the art nithing else
10-08-2018T14:16:11,SageSaga,and added a Harem because - Merch?
10-08-2018T14:16:21,sunblaze,^
10-08-2018T14:16:43,SageSaga,though i hear the writer is basically rewriting it so - he could fix a lot
10-08-2018T14:17:23,SageSaga,im sure he has heard the criticism -
10-08-2018T14:18:10,LannAF,Sage
10-08-2018T14:18:15,SageSaga,"""Hey i get you want to separate yourself from the story you plagiarized but- why make a terrible rapist villain?"
10-08-2018T14:18:19,SageSaga,yo Lann
10-08-2018T14:18:19,LannAF,"You're still in discord, FYI"
10-08-2018T14:18:23,LannAF,also howdy
10-08-2018T14:18:33,LannAF,There ya go xD
10-08-2018T14:18:41,LannAF,I was confused as to why you were still in
10-08-2018T14:19:11,SageSaga,when i open the streaming software it mutes it and i was in a private chat with Shiden
10-08-2018T14:19:17,MatyMaty,wasn't dot .Hack the first franchise to do this kinda thing?
10-08-2018T14:19:27,Pimsan,Not really.
10-08-2018T14:19:30,MatyMaty,"er, .Hack"
10-08-2018T14:19:33,SageSaga,I think Wizard of Oz did it first?
10-08-2018T14:20:13,Pimsan,"In the second Hack G.U game The main characters were trapped in the game, but for a while."
10-08-2018T14:20:29,SageSaga,Wizard of Oz - Old School Isekai
10-08-2018T14:22:08,MatyMaty,well I've seen a tweet saying that
10-08-2018T14:22:27,MatyMaty,Captain N was the first Isekai :P
10-08-2018T14:23:09,SageSaga,Wizard of Oz is from like 1900
10-08-2018T14:23:31,SageSaga,and i think it really is not 1900 not 1900s
10-08-2018T14:23:51,SageSaga,is 1900 not 1900s
10-08-2018T14:24:40,MatyMaty,doesn'r Isekai needs to involve videogames? :thinking:
10-08-2018T14:24:45,SageSaga,nope
10-08-2018T14:24:53,SageSaga,"Isekai means ""in another world"""
10-08-2018T14:25:14,SageSaga,but if you want to say RPG Lit - i give you- Dungeons and Dragons the cartoon! 1983!
10-08-2018T14:25:44,sunblaze,now thats a low blow sage.....
10-08-2018T14:26:01,SageSaga,hey that was a good cartoon
10-08-2018T14:26:32,FoxxTrotter,Yes...it was a good cartoon. :0)
10-08-2018T14:26:45,sunblaze,not my taste but alright
10-08-2018T14:27:20,Pimsan,I think i kinda remember that show. But it was around the time when i was still little.
10-08-2018T14:27:58,sunblaze,"then again I actually bought the dvd of the ""movie"""
10-08-2018T14:28:08,sunblaze,and yes it was bad but still needed it :D for reasons
10-08-2018T14:28:22,SageSaga,the Live action movie? Why?!
10-08-2018T14:28:35,SageSaga,the Cartoon is way better
10-08-2018T14:28:36,sunblaze,I blame my youth
10-08-2018T14:28:51,MatyMaty,TRon :P
10-08-2018T14:28:58,sunblaze,I was young and needed the money
10-08-2018T14:29:08,FoxxTrotter,Dragon's Lair was a major arcade game that came out the same year.
10-08-2018T14:29:21,FoxxTrotter,Tron ROX. :0)
10-08-2018T14:29:28,SageSaga,Tron beats D&D cartoon by 1 year
10-08-2018T14:29:31,sunblaze,ans somehow made it to steam. wonders never cease to exist
10-08-2018T14:29:41,SageSaga,however
10-08-2018T14:29:48,SageSaga,Tron does not count as RPG lit
10-08-2018T14:29:53,MatyMaty,aww
10-08-2018T14:30:09,SageSaga,"it DOES count as ""Trapped in a Video game"" though"
10-08-2018T14:30:23,sunblaze,literally yeah
10-08-2018T14:31:14,SageSaga,also counts as Isekai
10-08-2018T14:31:53,MatyMaty,:D
10-08-2018T15:07:09,Pimsan,"So anyway, how is everyone doing today?"
10-08-2018T15:09:33,SageSaga,im hungry
10-08-2018T15:10:17,Pimsan,Did you eat breakfast?
10-08-2018T15:10:52,SageSaga,no
10-08-2018T15:12:07,Pimsan,Then you should do that first.
10-08-2018T15:12:35,SageSaga,my food went bad yesterday
10-08-2018T15:12:44,Pimsan,How bad?
10-08-2018T15:13:19,SageSaga,inedible bad
10-08-2018T15:13:47,sunblaze,no emergency stuff like canned or dried avaible?
10-08-2018T15:13:59,SageSaga,nope
10-08-2018T15:14:37,Pimsan,Yikes.
10-08-2018T15:14:42,sunblaze,how far to the next open store?
10-08-2018T15:14:52,sunblaze,or oderder thai / similar
10-08-2018T15:15:16,SageSaga,7 miles
10-08-2018T15:16:54,sunblaze,do you want to take a break to buy food and/or order stuff?
10-08-2018T15:16:57,SageSaga,when stream is done i will order food and go pick it up
10-08-2018T15:17:12,sunblaze,good choice :D
10-08-2018T15:17:44,SageSaga,brb - i can drink water
10-08-2018T15:18:36,Pimsan,Okay.
10-08-2018T15:20:37,SageSaga,if i could afford it i would have mexican delivered
10-08-2018T15:24:22,Pimsan,I think it would be best to get it yourself. You will save up some money too.
10-08-2018T15:24:26,MatyMaty,it is that expensive? o_o
10-08-2018T15:25:21,Twokinds,It would be pretty expensive to get Lann all the way to you.
10-08-2018T15:26:32,Pimsan,"My parents always say to make sure you don't spent much money, or you will get in trouble."
10-08-2018T15:27:16,SageSaga,Ty- Food ordered!
10-08-2018T15:27:31,sunblaze,about time :D
10-08-2018T15:28:04,SageSaga,Delivery is expensive for them because they dont have a lot of drivers
10-08-2018T15:29:00,sunblaze,yeah my favourite itallian does not deliver at all. luckyly it is like a quartermile down a few streets so no need to drive
10-08-2018T15:31:14,SageSaga,i just had to call down to them because the address looks funny
10-08-2018T15:31:37,SageSaga,"I was like ""uhh- the zip code is right but it says the Point instead of where i live-"""
10-08-2018T15:31:45,sunblaze,:P
10-08-2018T15:32:44,SageSaga,"they were like ""ive never heard of this place"" and im like ""Remember Farm Fresh?"" ""Yeah!"" ""its right across from there- its been there for 3 years now"" ""Oh! That new place with the apartments!"" ""Town houses behind them- yep"""
10-08-2018T15:33:35,SageSaga,im gonna need to keep my headphones off and maybe open the door so i can hear them
10-08-2018T15:34:22,Twokinds,:csagesaga-c3:
10-08-2018T15:34:59,Twokinds,:csagesaga-c4: Aaaaw yeah now I can finally use this one!

10-08-2018T15:43:43,SparkytheAlpha,I'm going to go check out your comics I really love to kind so I hope they're a lot like that or something around that same principle
10-08-2018T15:43:54,SparkytheAlpha,Twokinds
10-08-2018T15:44:40,Pimsan,"It's 22:44 where i live, and i was planning to get pizza, but it was close so i had to go with fries."
10-08-2018T15:45:02,sunblaze,in story no i art a little :D but yes they are all awesome
10-08-2018T15:45:24,SparkytheAlpha,Sweet

10-08-2018T15:46:28,SageSaga,Yosh is over 2100 pages now
10-08-2018T15:46:38,SparkytheAlpha,Is it as old as twokinds?
10-08-2018T15:46:58,SageSaga,almost- i think Tom started a month before me?
10-08-2018T15:47:50,Pimsan,Wow.
10-08-2018T15:47:57,SparkytheAlpha,Cool I'm going to order the 4 volumes of twokinds next Friday because don't know of any other way to help him with his comics think I'm already a patreon of his
10-08-2018T15:48:44,SparkytheAlpha,So hopefully I will like your comics just as much and be able to show my support to you as well so you all may continue to make such great stories and Comics because that relieves a lot of the stress in my life cuz God knows I got a lot of that right now
10-08-2018T15:49:21,Twokinds,Glad to help! ^^
10-08-2018T15:50:39,SparkytheAlpha,Thought I'd be interested in stories of forbidden love but hell it's surprise me could never get into anything that involve just human beings in Forbidden Love or for some reason when it comes to freeze it does matter to me and interests me
10-08-2018T15:50:47,SparkytheAlpha,Never
10-08-2018T15:51:12,SparkytheAlpha,Furrys
10-08-2018T15:51:48,sunblaze,"forbiden love is only forbidden if society does not accept it. you can either enjoy that or change society to accpt the ""other"" things"
10-08-2018T15:52:22,sunblaze,granted that might make those new ones the ones that dislike and abandon the old rules. thats life
10-08-2018T15:53:03,sunblaze,100% tolerance is incredibly difficult if not impossible
10-08-2018T15:57:24,SparkytheAlpha,True true
10-08-2018T15:58:03,SparkytheAlpha,Some of society me but not all of it never will
10-08-2018T15:58:11,SparkytheAlpha,Maybe
10-08-2018T15:59:50,Twokinds,I am a big fan of forbidden love type stories.
10-08-2018T15:59:56,Twokinds,Which... is probably obvious
10-08-2018T16:00:09,sunblaze,kinda :D
10-08-2018T16:03:48,SparkytheAlpha,Lol. Yeah obviously. I would love to see Keith and Natani confess they're feelings to each other and hopefully Eric will wake up before it's to late with Kat but for the rest especially Raine. I'm having a difficult time in figuring out who she would  and
10-08-2018T16:04:13,SparkytheAlpha,Fall in love with and that would fall in love with her
10-08-2018T16:04:26,SparkytheAlpha,But we shall see
10-08-2018T16:04:34,SparkytheAlpha,😘
10-08-2018T16:13:11,MatyMaty,still has a dim hope for RainexZen
10-08-2018T16:13:22,Twokinds,Raine x Maren
10-08-2018T16:13:32,SageSaga,Karen x Sage
10-08-2018T16:13:59,MatyMaty,Sage x FemClovis
10-08-2018T16:14:07,sunblaze,its the ears sage right? I know :D
10-08-2018T16:14:27,SageSaga,no! Femclovis would be too harsh with me!
10-08-2018T16:14:44,Twokinds,Phil x FemPhil
10-08-2018T16:15:01,Pimsan,Think i'm going to hit the bed. Thanks for the stream and see you guys laters!
10-08-2018T16:15:03,SageSaga,it would never work out
10-08-2018T16:15:15,SageSaga,take care Pim!
10-08-2018T16:17:20,SageSaga,"Trace - ""Who are you?"" ""I- am Sage, Karen's husband to be!"" Karen - ""Im still not old enough"" Sage- ""But- its been like 14 years!"" Karen - ""It's been 6 months!"" Sage - ""CURSES!"""
10-08-2018T16:18:03,MatyMaty,"Besides Sage, you will have to deal with the KarenxMaddy shippers"
10-08-2018T16:18:11,sunblaze,haha :D
10-08-2018T16:18:46,SageSaga,She can be our maid and Karen's lesbian lover
10-08-2018T16:19:28,sunblaze,that seem strangely appropiate
10-08-2018T16:21:10,SageSaga,its almost like im a good story teller or something
10-08-2018T16:22:55,SageSaga,now if only i was good at advertising
10-08-2018T16:23:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Maren x Raine? 🚢
10-08-2018T16:23:36,MatyMaty,Too obvious :P
10-08-2018T16:23:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a story by the way guys
10-08-2018T16:24:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Lady came in for some General Tao chicken
10-08-2018T16:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,She pronounces it “General Sushi”
10-08-2018T16:25:12,SageSaga,that's racist
10-08-2018T16:25:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I was so confused for a minute it’s not funny
10-08-2018T16:26:20,SageSaga,"""Ma'am, you cant say that, it's very offensive"""
10-08-2018T16:26:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard just about ever pronunciation of that stuff working here. But that one takes the cale
10-08-2018T16:26:46,SpazztasticKiwi,*cake
10-08-2018T16:26:57,Bgrmystr2,allllll caught up... and it's been a long fuckin night. :ptv-sad:
10-08-2018T16:27:15,SageSaga,caught up on what?
10-08-2018T16:27:21,MatyMaty,wb Bgr
10-08-2018T16:27:34,Bgrmystr2,the chat
10-08-2018T16:27:49,SageSaga,wow
10-08-2018T16:28:09,Bgrmystr2,I woke up when you guys were shipping characters and sage self-shipped with Karen
10-08-2018T16:28:16,MatyMaty,XD
10-08-2018T16:28:19,Bgrmystr2,and have been catching up since then
10-08-2018T16:28:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had an interesting morning. Popped in to see that and share my lil tidbit
10-08-2018T16:29:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta go back soon
10-08-2018T16:30:13,Bgrmystr2,"I updated my firefox last night to the ESR line and I lost 2 months of bookmarks.. multiple games, mics, cosplays, anime sites, entire folders I spent hours sorting through.. hundreds gone"
10-08-2018T16:30:33,Bgrmystr2,so I wanted to ask if anyone knew if firefox saved data after updating in windows temp files or whatnot
10-08-2018T16:30:35,Bgrmystr2,:u
10-08-2018T16:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Well shit™️
10-08-2018T16:31:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Way to go, Paul!"
10-08-2018T16:31:31,Bgrmystr2,I also can't get picarto notifier to connect to picarto cuz the OAuth does literally nothing.. :c
10-08-2018T16:31:42,Bgrmystr2,but that's hardly my priority
10-08-2018T16:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun with that. I’m going back to my sentence
10-08-2018T16:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Closing. Again
10-08-2018T16:33:02,MatyMaty,I only use chrome :disappointed:
10-08-2018T16:33:09,MatyMaty,sorry Bgr
10-08-2018T16:33:47,SageSaga,i only use Chrome now too - when i did use firefox i always backed up the bookmarks
10-08-2018T16:34:05,SageSaga,im paranoid about loosing data
10-08-2018T16:34:15,SageSaga,*saves*
10-08-2018T16:34:18,SparkytheAlpha,Well I've usually have the weekends off but I've gotten several calls today about several machines down that I got to go to first thing in the morning and try to fix by the miracle of God apparently they think Parts just come out of my butt
10-08-2018T16:34:31,MatyMaty,Makes me wonder why cloud backed bookmarks aren't a thing
10-08-2018T16:34:34,Bgrmystr2,Firefox has NEVER deleted bookmarks from updating the client
10-08-2018T16:34:40,Bgrmystr2,not before this Dx
10-08-2018T16:34:49,Bgrmystr2,they always take the current bookmarks you have
10-08-2018T16:34:55,Bgrmystr2,and implement them
10-08-2018T16:35:10,SparkytheAlpha,Got to love technology
10-08-2018T16:35:31,Bgrmystr2,So I dunno what in the fuck it was doing using something from June 2nd
10-08-2018T16:36:07,SparkytheAlpha,Hey hey language my virgin ears. Geeze! Lol😂😂😂
10-08-2018T16:36:28,Bgrmystr2,Your virgin ears need to be poked eventually :P
10-08-2018T16:37:06,Bgrmystr2,"Maty, did you have to manually authorize the picarto notifier in chrome?"
10-08-2018T16:38:38,SparkytheAlpha,Lol yeah that was about 16years ago
10-08-2018T16:38:59,MatyMaty,Mmmmmm I think so
10-08-2018T16:39:04,SparkytheAlpha,How do I get notifications to my phone from this chat
10-08-2018T16:39:15,Bgrmystr2,How did you do it maty
10-08-2018T16:39:18,SparkytheAlpha,From the app
10-08-2018T16:39:58,Bgrmystr2,"just turn on notifications for picarto, though I dunno how it all works cuz I don't have a smartphone"
10-08-2018T16:40:44,SparkytheAlpha,Mine is a Android. I turned on the notifications but I'm not getting any I even turn on the sound have no sound
10-08-2018T16:41:07,MatyMaty,Oh on my phone I use the mail notifications
10-08-2018T16:41:31,SageSaga,i love the update on Android
10-08-2018T16:41:32,SparkytheAlpha,So does it send you a notification every time somebody writes a message in chat
10-08-2018T16:41:46,SparkytheAlpha,Update?
10-08-2018T16:41:59,SageSaga,"""You keep dismissing these notifications- would you like to turn them off?"" ""OMG I CAN DO THAT?! YESSSS!"""
10-08-2018T16:42:10,MatyMaty,I just tried again Bgr
10-08-2018T16:42:15,SageSaga,New Android Update
10-08-2018T16:42:21,MatyMaty,and I got the notifications automatically
10-08-2018T16:42:49,MatyMaty,no authorization needed
10-08-2018T16:42:52,SageSaga,Android 9.0 Pie
10-08-2018T16:43:02,SparkytheAlpha,Hmmmm...????
10-08-2018T16:43:05,Bgrmystr2,hm
10-08-2018T16:43:39,Bgrmystr2,the notifier for firefox wants me to authorize for use with picarto
10-08-2018T16:43:40,Bgrmystr2,which is fine
10-08-2018T16:43:51,Bgrmystr2,and then I click the generate OAuth.. and nothing happens
10-08-2018T16:44:02,Bgrmystr2,it acts like I never clicked the button
10-08-2018T16:44:25,Bgrmystr2,and picarto has nothing in the settings to manually allow something to be authorized
10-08-2018T16:44:37,MatyMaty,okay just ran Firefox and installed the thing
10-08-2018T16:44:41,MatyMaty,it worked right away
10-08-2018T16:44:51,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
10-08-2018T16:44:59,MatyMaty,as soon as I installed it it gave me the notifications
10-08-2018T16:45:04,SparkytheAlpha,I think I made my mind up Raine X Sythe
10-08-2018T16:45:09,MatyMaty,the Picarto notifier for Firefox :P
10-08-2018T16:45:21,Bgrmystr2,then I dunno what the problem is.
10-08-2018T16:45:24,Bgrmystr2,Mine is broken
10-08-2018T16:45:27,MatyMaty,so it might be something on your end
10-08-2018T16:45:30,Bgrmystr2,I tried deleting and re-adding it
10-08-2018T16:45:51,Bgrmystr2,"it's literally a fresh install of ESR, apparerently.. cuz it deleted all my fuckin data"
10-08-2018T16:46:02,SageSaga,"delete firefox, get 16 more gigs of memory, use Chrome"
10-08-2018T16:46:09,Bgrmystr2,fuck that
10-08-2018T16:46:12,SageSaga,XD
10-08-2018T16:46:21,SparkytheAlpha,See it's your fault  BGR! It's always you... Lol
10-08-2018T16:46:24,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't touch chrome with a 50 mile pole lol
10-08-2018T16:46:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah clearly always my fault even when I went out of my way to do everything I possibly could to fix it xD
10-08-2018T16:46:44,MatyMaty,well I stopped using Firefox because someow it  used more  memory than my art programs
10-08-2018T16:46:46,MatyMaty,:P
10-08-2018T16:47:03,Bgrmystr2,lol well that seems rather silly.
10-08-2018T16:47:24,Bgrmystr2,Mine only uses like 4-5 gb and it's only after letting it run for like.. a week
10-08-2018T16:48:16,SageSaga,Maty may post a link
10-08-2018T16:48:30,MatyMaty,https://cdn.dopl3r.com/memes_files/when-you-accidentally-open-internet-explorer-instead-of-chrome-ahhh-after-10000-years-im-free-its-time-to-conquer-the-earth-yHKKv.jpg
10-08-2018T16:48:42,MatyMaty,"you always have other options, Bgr :P"
10-08-2018T16:49:19,Bgrmystr2,oh god
10-08-2018T16:49:59,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: t-to be honest.. I don't know which one I'd rather between IE and Chrome.
10-08-2018T16:50:05,MatyMaty,waaaat
10-08-2018T16:50:11,MatyMaty,You have to be kidding :P
10-08-2018T16:50:43,Bgrmystr2,"naw, they're both equally terrible imo"
10-08-2018T16:50:53,SageSaga,Bgr is scared of Chrome watching him while he sleeps
10-08-2018T16:50:55,Bgrmystr2,just for different reasons
10-08-2018T16:51:08,Bgrmystr2,lol sage please xD
10-08-2018T16:51:08,MatyMaty,what about Safari or Opera?
10-08-2018T16:51:16,Bgrmystr2,I tried opera actually
10-08-2018T16:51:20,Bgrmystr2,it was okay
10-08-2018T16:51:21,sunblaze,nah sage only the white dresses little girls do that.
10-08-2018T16:51:25,sunblaze,out of your TV!
10-08-2018T16:51:40,Bgrmystr2,but it's not like I'm actively looking for alternatives atm
10-08-2018T16:53:22,MatyMaty,why not have
10-08-2018T16:53:28,MatyMaty,2 browsers installed? :P
10-08-2018T16:53:31,MatyMaty,just in case?
10-08-2018T16:54:13,Bgrmystr2,"yeah atm IE is my backup, though I have a laptop that works too so the firefox on there is equally as useful"
10-08-2018T16:54:24,MatyMaty,all browsers can import bookmarks and such from each other :P
10-08-2018T16:54:30,Bgrmystr2,..only reason being IE is that you can't remove it from 7 without the OS being rather problematic
10-08-2018T16:54:32,SageSaga,wait wat- is IE still a thing or do you mean Edge?
10-08-2018T16:54:38,Bgrmystr2,I don't have edge
10-08-2018T16:54:39,Bgrmystr2,I have IE
10-08-2018T16:54:40,MatyMaty,There are both :P
10-08-2018T16:54:41,SageSaga,ohhh
10-08-2018T16:54:48,MatyMaty,In win 10
10-08-2018T16:54:50,SageSaga,right i forgot you are like really scared of change
10-08-2018T16:54:54,MatyMaty,yuou have both for some reason
10-08-2018T16:55:10,Bgrmystr2,"not scared of change, just don't like companies invading my privacy"
10-08-2018T16:55:17,MatyMaty,what windows do you have BGr?
10-08-2018T16:55:32,Bgrmystr2,windows 7
10-08-2018T16:56:03,MatyMaty,ah
10-08-2018T16:56:18,SageSaga,do you use a VPN?
10-08-2018T16:57:12,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes, but not regularly. the ISP is gonna know shit about me irrelevant"
10-08-2018T16:57:38,Bgrmystr2,"also, if I did, I wouldn't be able to watch streams reliably"
10-08-2018T16:58:01,SageSaga,i hear PIA is really good
10-08-2018T16:58:29,Bgrmystr2,thaaaaat's not free
10-08-2018T16:59:02,SageSaga,of course not- if it were free they would be using your info to pay for it
10-08-2018T16:59:23,Bgrmystr2,and there's the problem lol
10-08-2018T16:59:24,SageSaga,"free is generally code for ""We sell your info"""
10-08-2018T16:59:48,SageSaga,i think they are cheap though
10-08-2018T17:00:04,sunblaze,^both true
10-08-2018T17:01:25,SageSaga,3 bucks a month to really keep your data safe
10-08-2018T17:01:35,SageSaga,worth it if you are worried about it

10-08-2018T17:03:05,SageSaga,take care Sparky
10-08-2018T17:03:49,SageSaga,i think anyone who is seriously concerned with their info being take that isnt using something like PIA is clearly not as concerned as they make it out to be
10-08-2018T17:04:43,Bgrmystr2,being concerned and being poor are two separate factors sage
10-08-2018T17:05:13,Bgrmystr2,I'd like to be able to eat first and formost yeah you're right
10-08-2018T17:06:13,SageSaga,i get that but its rare for someone even a poor person unless they are homeless level of poor to not be able to make 3 dollars a month for something
10-08-2018T17:06:19,Bgrmystr2,foremost*
10-08-2018T17:07:03,Bgrmystr2,"I get money here and there, and it all goes to food expenses and letting me stay here. Bar that, I literally would be on the street."

10-08-2018T17:07:54,SageSaga,Pan Handle for Private Internet Access!
10-08-2018T17:07:55,SparkytheAlpha,Before I go I have a story for you all
10-08-2018T17:08:13,SparkytheAlpha,My real nickname is Sparky in real life the way I obtained this name is quite funny and interesting
10-08-2018T17:08:30,SageSaga,"""What's your sob story?"" ""I just need 3 bucks to keep my info safe from THE MAN!"" ""Huh- ok here's 3 bucks"""
10-08-2018T17:08:41,Bgrmystr2,xD Sage
10-08-2018T17:09:03,Bgrmystr2,"there's so many people on the street here who do that who aren't actually poor, noone gives them any money"
10-08-2018T17:09:10,Bgrmystr2,so that wouldn't actually work
10-08-2018T17:09:20,SparkytheAlpha,Back in 2005 I was building a preventive maintenance truck for a construction company I was using a torch to cut holes in the light bar for the work lights on the back of the truck which had a used oil tank on the back which I had the lid open to keep fro
10-08-2018T17:09:42,SparkytheAlpha,It from exploding in a ball of fire in case the vapors caught fire from the Burrs from the torch
10-08-2018T17:10:13,SparkytheAlpha,The owner of the company ran out asked me if I could take the truck out and pump some hydraulic into a track hoe that had blown in hydraulic line I came back not thinking that the wind had closed the lid to the waste oil tank and immediately started torch
10-08-2018T17:10:39,Bgrmystr2,:boom:
10-08-2018T17:10:48,SparkytheAlpha,Do you like bar again in doing so it caught the vapors in the tank on fire which blew the lid open and then golfing my body in flames open my eyes to find myself standing on the floor behind the truck with a torch just going on the floor with half of my c
10-08-2018T17:11:29,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: this.. seems more and more like a copy paste
10-08-2018T17:11:48,SageSaga,its also very long for a story
10-08-2018T17:12:08,sunblaze,also very suicidal. be glad to be alive!
10-08-2018T17:12:25,SparkytheAlpha,Cloths durnt off
10-08-2018T17:12:26,SageSaga,i knew a guy who was working on electrical stuff so he locked the box and put a chain on it. Someone cut the chain and turned it on. Killed him- he fell 3 stories- the impact started his heart back up
10-08-2018T17:13:07,SparkytheAlpha,Needless to say I came back in the next morning at 5:30 in the morning all bandaged up like a mummy ready to go back to work later that day the owner of the company came into the office when I was in a meeting with the shop foreman and said hey Sparky wha
10-08-2018T17:13:24,SparkytheAlpha,How are you doing buddy and that's how I earned the nickname Sparky and has been stuck with me ever since no matter where I go and where I work
10-08-2018T17:14:02,SageSaga,you can shorten that story a lot
10-08-2018T17:14:04,SparkytheAlpha,Sorry it was so long but I love telling that story because in real life people always ask me why do they call me Sparky
10-08-2018T17:14:31,SparkytheAlpha,Anyways guys thanks for listening had fun chat with y'all later
10-08-2018T17:14:57,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I have a feeling we've been had.

10-08-2018T17:16:03,SageSaga,What if the explosion knocked your soul out?
10-08-2018T17:16:30,SageSaga,If a sneeze can do it an explosion should-
10-08-2018T17:16:31,SparkytheAlpha,Lol whatever Sage. Catch you Hooligans later. Then I would just be an empty shell of a man

10-08-2018T17:27:52,SageSaga,also Honey does pretty much last forever- it doesnt spoil - they found some in Egypt in a seal room of an unearthed building-
10-08-2018T17:28:11,sunblaze,indeed
10-08-2018T17:28:16,SageSaga,all they had to do was add some water to it to re-hydrate it and it was edible!

10-08-2018T17:47:56,SageSaga,and its even worse on mine because its on a 2k screen
10-08-2018T17:48:38,SageSaga,but at 1080 the file size is like 800kb - and they only allow 512kb
10-08-2018T17:49:26,SageSaga,actually its closer to 1MB but yeah
10-08-2018T17:49:27,Twokinds,"Ah, yeah"
10-08-2018T17:49:59,SageSaga,yet the Chat banner can be 650kb - and is 410x80!!!

10-08-2018T17:52:06,Twokinds,I can make a jpg at 1080 around 400 without much compression
