19-03-2018T00:01:57,NightMeaty22,some people just need someone to hate and that someone is me
19-03-2018T00:03:42,NightMeaty22,at one point i had friends then i got hit by a truck
19-03-2018T00:03:49,Vatruvius,"Not entirely, you will find out as your gain some years that people are just insecure. They see themselves in you and do not want to become an outcast so they do it to you."
19-03-2018T00:04:40,Vatruvius,"I lost every single friend I had in high school junior year, my last year and a half was spent with no one stuck in classrooms with people I despised."
19-03-2018T00:05:43,Vatruvius,"It may not look it right now, but things will get better. School is temporary, you just need to find groups of people like yourself to hang out with."
19-03-2018T00:06:10,Vatruvius,"At worst, you have a year or two of school to get through until a new round of faces come through."
19-03-2018T00:08:57,NightMeaty22,4 years of hate makes you want to end it all
19-03-2018T00:10:49,Vatruvius,Did you just start highschool?
19-03-2018T00:11:06,NightMeaty22,no about to tho
19-03-2018T00:11:16,NightMeaty22,well end jh
19-03-2018T00:13:30,Vatruvius,"Yeah, you should find plenty of new faces. Join clubs, talk to other outliers. You have a lot ahead of you, it will be fun. Everyone else will be nervous/looking for friends as well."
19-03-2018T00:15:41,NightMeaty22,i am just hoping it will be better
19-03-2018T00:16:56,NightMeaty22,because i dont think i can go on if this keeps happning
19-03-2018T00:17:21,Vatruvius,"There is so much to look forward to, all you have to do is be patient. It is hard though, sometimes I wish I had a fast forward button but it will be worth it."
19-03-2018T00:17:49,Vatruvius,Have you ever told anyone else like your parents about this?
19-03-2018T00:18:02,NightMeaty22,yah
19-03-2018T00:20:09,Vatruvius,"It is important to realize that your family will always be there for you, no matter what. Things may be bad but you still have them, they will never leave you."
19-03-2018T00:21:03,NightMeaty22,my brothers tell my to kill my self so...
19-03-2018T00:21:21,NightMeaty22,but i know what you mean
19-03-2018T00:22:57,Vatruvius,"If you did kill yourself, you brothers will regret for the rest of their lives telling you to do that. They kid, they pry, brothers bring out the worst in each other and push each other hard. Heck...life will change drastically in a matter of a year."
19-03-2018T00:24:01,Vatruvius,"It just is not worth throwing away what could be because of the words of a few, inexperienced individuals that do not even know who they are in life yet."
19-03-2018T00:24:30,NightMeaty22,the only person that was really my friend moved and when that happened people just got worse
19-03-2018T00:26:06,Vatruvius,"I am sorry to hear that...my best friend for two years stabbed me in the back where it hurt most for something as petty as an award. Not even an award, just recognition that you did something."
19-03-2018T00:26:42,NightMeaty22,i think all this stuff started because of my last name but after time it got worse and worse
19-03-2018T00:27:32,NightMeaty22,tell i almost killed my self
19-03-2018T00:28:19,Vatruvius,"There is always someone who is easy for others to pick on. One person starts it and everyone else joins in...they will all grow up with regrets. Honestly, I felt similarly to the way you do."
19-03-2018T00:28:45,Vatruvius,"I lost everything and was ready for the world to just end it, rid me of the pain."
19-03-2018T00:29:19,Vatruvius,"But I held on anyway, I could not be more happy now then ever before because of it."
19-03-2018T00:31:41,NightMeaty22,i feel like i am starting to gain a friend then they just betray me because one of there friends hates me
19-03-2018T00:33:19,Vatruvius,Yeah...where do you go to school. Is it in a big city?
19-03-2018T00:33:30,NightMeaty22,not really

19-03-2018T00:35:18,Vatruvius,It that where you live? Is it a small town?
19-03-2018T00:35:32,NightMeaty22,it is hard not to see the people that hate you and use you
19-03-2018T00:35:49,NightMeaty22,yes
19-03-2018T00:35:59,NightMeaty22,and it is smallish
19-03-2018T00:36:29,NightMeaty22,i go to a place called sjhs
19-03-2018T00:38:05,Vatruvius,Would that be a junior high school? The S is for Springville?
19-03-2018T00:38:16,NightMeaty22,yes
19-03-2018T00:38:34,Vatruvius,How many grades are there? Just upper class?

19-03-2018T00:40:32,NightMeaty22,yah i dont have a computer or internet for that mater
19-03-2018T00:40:54,NightMeaty22,just phone and 4g
19-03-2018T00:41:05,Vatruvius,"So where are you, at home?"

19-03-2018T00:42:25,NightMeaty22,are you going to track me should i start running¿
19-03-2018T00:42:27,Vatruvius,Ahh...it is later where you are compared to me. I am in California.
19-03-2018T00:42:38,Vatruvius,What do you mean track you?
19-03-2018T00:42:54,Vatruvius,Is that a thing?
19-03-2018T00:43:28,NightMeaty22,people can hack and track other people throw cell
19-03-2018T00:43:45,NightMeaty22,it is creppy
19-03-2018T00:43:51,Vatruvius,Okay...that is a little creepy. Now you are making me paranoid about my phone.
19-03-2018T00:44:18,NightMeaty22,ok...
19-03-2018T00:44:52,Vatruvius,"I just want you to know that you seem like a really good kid, you got that?"
19-03-2018T00:45:14,NightMeaty22,but the government tracks you and they also spy on you
19-03-2018T00:45:39,NightMeaty22,thanks
19-03-2018T00:46:36,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I can't really do anything about the government but at least they are being secretive. If it was just a random person they could turn on m camera or whatever and leak things on the internet."
19-03-2018T00:47:10,Vatruvius,Not that I am naked in front of my phone or anything...I mean...no way...:ptv-hearts:
19-03-2018T00:49:33,NightMeaty22,what stoped me from killing myself was the twokinds comic and i found people to help me with my life problems thank you vatruvius
19-03-2018T00:49:53,Vatruvius,no problem
19-03-2018T00:50:10,NightMeaty22,you are one of the best people i have talked to
19-03-2018T00:52:32,Vatruvius,So what is your real name?NightMeaty22 is a bit of a mouthful.
19-03-2018T01:01:09,Vatruvius,How many people are in your class Jacob?
19-03-2018T01:01:14,Vatruvius,Well shit...
19-03-2018T01:01:34,NightMeaty22,good morning 12:01
19-03-2018T01:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone still on? Went to bed early and it’s kind of backfired
19-03-2018T01:26:48,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but I am about to get off. Unless you really need a buddy..."
19-03-2018T01:27:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah I’ll find something entertaining
19-03-2018T01:30:38,Vatruvius,Alright then...goodnight everyone!
19-03-2018T01:36:08,TheBeckoner,Night
19-03-2018T01:39:05,Dadrobit,Have a good one.
19-03-2018T03:06:04,Twokinds,What do humans do for fun
19-03-2018T03:08:26,unsteddyphoenix,Various Media
19-03-2018T03:08:45,unsteddyphoenix,"I for one am reading this nifty comic called ""Freefall"" right now. :)"
19-03-2018T03:10:34,unsteddyphoenix,When was the last time you watched a tv show or somethin?
19-03-2018T03:15:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Y’all are still up
19-03-2018T03:15:57,unsteddyphoenix,My timezone helps
19-03-2018T03:16:04,unsteddyphoenix,Not that I dont stay up 'til 3am anyway
19-03-2018T03:16:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Well Bagheera is currently chewing on my arm
19-03-2018T03:17:04,SpazztasticKiwi,So I’m not sleeping
19-03-2018T03:17:24,unsteddyphoenix,Your cats arent ready for you to sleep and youll just have to deal with that
19-03-2018T03:17:50,Dadrobit,"I get a lot of my work in at night. The rest of the country is asleep, way less competition."
19-03-2018T03:18:23,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed
19-03-2018T03:18:40,unsteddyphoenix,though its not always the bes to do work before bed
19-03-2018T03:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"And to answer your question Tom, it depends on the human"
19-03-2018T03:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera now has his mouse toy. Chewing redirected
19-03-2018T03:19:39,Dadrobit,"I don't do all the work at night, just auditions and some conversations."
19-03-2018T03:22:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"My department’s not open after 10 pm, so I get home at 11ish at the latest"
19-03-2018T03:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I waist time on the internet
19-03-2018T03:23:17,SpazztasticKiwi,*waste
19-03-2018T03:42:54,Twokinds,no I meant in real life
19-03-2018T03:43:23,Twokinds,A friend of mine asked me what I wanted to do in Atlanta. But I don't know what people do.
19-03-2018T03:48:00,Dadrobit,Well.... It's Georgia soooooo....
19-03-2018T03:48:16,Dadrobit,Visit an aquarium or something?
19-03-2018T03:49:22,unsteddyphoenix,Oh like...REAL people
19-03-2018T03:49:30,Dadrobit,Maybe go see a movie?
19-03-2018T03:50:20,unsteddyphoenix,Solid
19-03-2018T03:50:32,unsteddyphoenix,Everyones raving about black panther right now
19-03-2018T03:50:39,Twokinds,lol
19-03-2018T03:50:52,Twokinds,Aquarium is exactly what they suggested.
19-03-2018T03:51:03,unsteddyphoenix,Nice dad
19-03-2018T03:51:09,Dadrobit,\o/
19-03-2018T03:51:12,Twokinds,They have panthers at the aquarium?
19-03-2018T03:51:30,unsteddyphoenix,Yes but they all wear scuba gear
19-03-2018T03:51:33,Dadrobit,"Georgia is all farmland and southern accents, I really have no idea what people do there for fun."
19-03-2018T03:51:45,Twokinds,I don't know what anyone does for fun.
19-03-2018T03:52:11,Dadrobit,"Well, in Arizona we have a really big hole in the ground..."
19-03-2018T03:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,Neat!
19-03-2018T03:52:49,Twokinds,I suggested skydiving but they said that's not a normal thing people casually do.
19-03-2018T03:52:59,Dadrobit,"A tribe built a glass skywalk on it, but I hear it's ludicrously expensive."
19-03-2018T03:53:07,unsteddyphoenix,But ive seen people do that :thinking:
19-03-2018T03:53:31,Dadrobit,Are these normal people? Why would they bring up normal people thins?
19-03-2018T03:53:55,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like theyre normal people
19-03-2018T03:54:09,Twokinds,"A lot of things I think of are physical, like rock climbing, but not everyone can participate in something like that."
19-03-2018T03:55:31,Twokinds,"I like bowling, but do people bowl anymore? I don't even know."
19-03-2018T03:55:56,unsteddyphoenix,Well youve already suggested skydiving
19-03-2018T03:56:02,unsteddyphoenix,So bowling is a step down from that
19-03-2018T03:56:15,Dadrobit,"Used to bowl a lot when my brother worked at an alley, not much at all since though."
19-03-2018T03:56:48,Twokinds,"Now I'm wondering if Wii Bowling had a noticable impact on Bowling alleys, up or down."
19-03-2018T03:57:05,Dadrobit,That's actually a clever question.
19-03-2018T03:57:07,unsteddyphoenix,The wii did quietly sell amazingly well
19-03-2018T03:57:17,Dadrobit,Quietly?
19-03-2018T03:57:22,Twokinds,bigly
19-03-2018T03:57:34,unsteddyphoenix,sizably
19-03-2018T03:57:54,unsteddyphoenix,But discreetly
19-03-2018T03:57:55,Dadrobit,inconceivably
19-03-2018T03:58:15,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly I wouldnt be surprised if it did
19-03-2018T03:58:24,unsteddyphoenix,Has there been a study I bet yes
19-03-2018T04:00:09,Dadrobit,"Holy crap, just looked up the cost for the Skywalk, over $80 per ticket. Holy Jeebus."
19-03-2018T04:01:52,Dadrobit,"Hit up the aquarium, 1/3 the cost lol."
19-03-2018T04:02:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I bowled once. Almost slipped and fell on my ass with those shoes
19-03-2018T04:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,But down here people mainly hunt for fun
19-03-2018T04:04:10,unsteddyphoenix,You could do that!
19-03-2018T04:05:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, dye your hair blue and go get some prime hunting in, Tom!"
19-03-2018T04:07:05,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: wait everyone's still here?
19-03-2018T04:07:27,unsteddyphoenix,Im always here.
19-03-2018T04:07:34,unsteddyphoenix,apart from when  im not
19-03-2018T04:07:44,Bgrmystr2,you live on the upsidedown part of the planet
19-03-2018T04:07:47,Bgrmystr2,you don't count
19-03-2018T04:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Stake out a field for animals that may or may not show up, or if they show up may or may not be suitable to shoot, for hours with no guarantee of getting anything?"
19-03-2018T04:07:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah
19-03-2018T04:09:10,Bgrmystr2,so is tom still here? Cuz I had a question ;o
19-03-2018T04:10:16,Bgrmystr2,kinda wondering if this ever became a thing https://www.turaiel.me/twokinds/images/Magical%20Mishaps%20Cover%20-%20Sketch.jpg
19-03-2018T04:10:31,Bgrmystr2,"Was talkin to phoenix about it, but wanted to confirm"
19-03-2018T04:16:10,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, that's an oldie."
19-03-2018T04:18:19,Bgrmystr2,lol yeah
19-03-2018T04:19:15,Twokinds,Nope. Nothing came of it. Yes...
19-03-2018T04:19:38,Bgrmystr2,"aww, that's a little disappointing"
19-03-2018T04:19:46,Bgrmystr2,but glad to know I didn't miss anything
19-03-2018T04:20:01,Twokinds,"In the end, I couldn't come up with a story."
19-03-2018T04:20:07,Bgrmystr2,:(
19-03-2018T04:20:16,Bgrmystr2,"Well, I'd like to read it one day, should you do so"
19-03-2018T04:20:24,Bgrmystr2,maybe a future side comic
19-03-2018T04:20:25,unsteddyphoenix,Someday...
19-03-2018T04:20:39,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like PPP covers this
19-03-2018T04:21:07,Bgrmystr2,"wasn't a body swap though, was it?"
19-03-2018T04:21:10,Bgrmystr2,that I recall....
19-03-2018T04:21:20,unsteddyphoenix,Wait for the sequel~
19-03-2018T04:21:24,Bgrmystr2,:u
19-03-2018T04:21:28,Dadrobit,Partially for Trace and Flora.
19-03-2018T04:21:37,Dadrobit,"Well, species swap I suppose."
19-03-2018T04:21:41,Bgrmystr2,lolo
19-03-2018T04:22:57,Bgrmystr2,Thanks for answering btw tom
19-03-2018T04:23:00,unsteddyphoenix,"One sketch idea was ""tiger trace and flora gender swapped"""
19-03-2018T04:23:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I can picture Trace chasing his new tail
19-03-2018T04:23:09,unsteddyphoenix,Just to maximum confuse people
19-03-2018T04:23:31,Dadrobit,That one was done wasn't it?
19-03-2018T04:23:46,unsteddyphoenix,idk
19-03-2018T04:23:54,Dadrobit,Trace ended up being a bustier Tiger as well.
19-03-2018T04:23:56,Dadrobit,IIRC
19-03-2018T04:24:37,unsteddyphoenix,But was flora a male at the same time
19-03-2018T04:24:40,unsteddyphoenix,For mass confusing
19-03-2018T04:24:51,Bgrmystr2,xDD
19-03-2018T04:24:56,Dadrobit,I think so?
19-03-2018T04:25:04,unsteddyphoenix,dangit
19-03-2018T04:25:24,Dadrobit,"There have been so many swaps over the years, I may just be making all of this up"
19-03-2018T04:25:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like a picture you glance at and think “something is wrong, but what exactly is it”"
19-03-2018T04:25:34,Dadrobit,But I'm pretty sure I'm not
19-03-2018T04:25:52,SpazztasticKiwi,A lot can happen in 14 years
19-03-2018T04:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Though that may not be how old the streams are
19-03-2018T04:26:41,Dadrobit,Streams are a bit over one year
19-03-2018T04:27:05,Dadrobit,"Want to search for what I'm imagining, but Picarto's archiving system is actual ass."
19-03-2018T04:27:24,unsteddyphoenix,s'true
19-03-2018T04:31:47,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
19-03-2018T04:38:48,Bgrmystr2,aren't they gonna bea about 2 years now?
19-03-2018T04:38:58,Bgrmystr2,"or at least a year and a half?, almost 2?"
19-03-2018T04:40:23,unsteddyphoenix,feels like a nice long while
19-03-2018T04:40:27,unsteddyphoenix,Since the DARK DAYS
19-03-2018T04:42:59,Dadrobit,"Just browsing through, Trace has become a Tiger at least 9.5 times, female in 4 of them. Flora's been human twice, but never a dude."
19-03-2018T04:43:41,unsteddyphoenix,9.5
19-03-2018T04:43:52,unsteddyphoenix,Aha!
19-03-2018T04:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys are gross. Everybody wants to see the ladies
19-03-2018T04:43:58,unsteddyphoenix,So there's...potential...
19-03-2018T04:44:12,unsteddyphoenix,Thats something men and women can agree on
19-03-2018T04:44:21,unsteddyphoenix,Woman are far better to look at
19-03-2018T04:44:30,unsteddyphoenix,Inarguable

19-03-2018T04:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,That sounds like an experience
19-03-2018T04:45:00,unsteddyphoenix,How specific
19-03-2018T04:45:02,Dadrobit,"Although, if he had Flora's bits, that made him female in 5 of them?"
19-03-2018T04:45:11,Dadrobit,4.5?
19-03-2018T04:45:30,unsteddyphoenix,"maybe 1/3, since he neither breasticle"
19-03-2018T04:46:06,SpazztasticKiwi,“Breasticle”
19-03-2018T04:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Good choice of words
19-03-2018T04:46:21,Dadrobit,"Eh, breasts don't count or else Flora and Laura would only be 1/3 all of the time."

19-03-2018T05:28:12,Dadrobit,It's great stuff when you're just doing something like cycling or jogging.
19-03-2018T05:28:28,unsteddyphoenix,Thats that stuff people do outside right?
