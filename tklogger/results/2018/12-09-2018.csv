12-09-2018T00:49:20,Vatruvius,How did I miss the Yosh! plug here...http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/101/
12-09-2018T00:49:29,Vatruvius,That is Penpen no?
12-09-2018T00:51:24,Twokinds,Yep!
12-09-2018T00:53:00,Vatruvius,"Why am I just now seeing it on my ninth read? I mean, I should have caught it by the sixth or seventh when I read Yosh!..."
12-09-2018T00:53:59,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: seemed obvious on my first readthrough
12-09-2018T00:55:39,Vatruvius,"I didn't even know of Yosh! on my first read. Twokinds introduced me into this whole web comic thing and even then I have not gotten any further than Yosh!, Twokinds, and AI"
12-09-2018T00:56:43,Bgrmystr2,I didn't either lol
12-09-2018T00:57:16,Vatruvius,Well alright Mr. Plug Spotter...
12-09-2018T00:57:38,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, a penguin with a knife kinda stands out"
12-09-2018T00:57:50,Bgrmystr2,"or dagger, as it were"
12-09-2018T00:57:57,Bgrmystr2,"why it's there, I don't know"
12-09-2018T00:58:15,Bgrmystr2,"Or rather, I didn't know, back then, but it was obviously there lol"
12-09-2018T00:58:48,Vatruvius,"Right, but I just don't think I ever noticed it. Since I am working on my own comic I am really paying attention to the details and layout of Twokinds. Before, I kinda just read all the text for the most part taking a quick glance at the images."
12-09-2018T00:59:08,Vatruvius,"Or just the main parts of the images, not the surroundings, foreground, or background."
12-09-2018T01:00:09,Vatruvius,"That aside, I got my new desk today. It is so good! So much real-state, and I can stand or sit with it! All that is left is the drawing monitor and I am good to go."
12-09-2018T01:03:05,Twokinds,Man my art was so good back then
12-09-2018T01:03:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Thank God someone explained it. I thought there was a random killer penguin plushie
12-09-2018T01:03:32,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s delusional. Call an ambulance
12-09-2018T01:04:00,Twokinds,"Hey, it's got that early webcomic charm to it."
12-09-2018T01:04:08,Vatruvius,It does.
12-09-2018T01:04:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Although maybe good is accurate since it’s better now. And it’s got that sketchy charm
12-09-2018T01:04:36,Vatruvius,It is also fascinating to see how your art changes as time progresses.
12-09-2018T01:05:20,Vatruvius,"But I just have to say, only a slight improvement from the background then to know. Just slight. XD"
12-09-2018T01:05:28,Vatruvius,now*
12-09-2018T01:05:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Tru
12-09-2018T01:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Half star improvement
12-09-2018T01:06:03,Vatruvius,^lol
12-09-2018T01:06:25,Vatruvius,*Solid color backgrounds to Bob Ross backgrounds*
12-09-2018T01:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Happy trees
12-09-2018T01:07:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Esp the ones in the bath scenes
12-09-2018T01:07:34,SpazztasticKiwi,“The trees seem to lean alot here. Lots of shade”
12-09-2018T01:07:47,Vatruvius,Through on some eyes and you have treedrans! XD
12-09-2018T01:07:55,Vatruvius,Throw*
12-09-2018T01:08:08,Vatruvius,"Man, late night spelling equals bad spelling."
12-09-2018T01:08:20,SpazztasticKiwi,You should’ve seen me this afternoon
12-09-2018T01:08:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I needed a nap
12-09-2018T01:09:33,Vatruvius,Hmm...I was busy building my desk so...happy times for me.
12-09-2018T01:09:36,Vatruvius,:D
12-09-2018T01:25:52,Vatruvius,"And here is some foreshadowing to my comic, or at least the last two panels sort of. http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/142/"
12-09-2018T01:47:33,SpazztasticKiwi,So lady finds guy but backs out basically at the alter for her ex?

12-09-2018T09:56:11,CrimsonQuill,Good Afternoon all!
12-09-2018T11:21:30,Vatruvius,Not at all. You will get it once my comic gets there but that is a ways a way out.
12-09-2018T12:26:54,MidNightBlue78,hey peeps
12-09-2018T12:27:02,MidNightBlue78,Good afternoon

12-09-2018T13:56:31,SpazztasticKiwi,This is an odd question but is there a phone brand that had an “8” model?
12-09-2018T13:56:38,SpazztasticKiwi,*has
12-09-2018T14:01:49,Twokinds,Uh...
12-09-2018T14:01:58,Twokinds,How do you mean?
12-09-2018T14:02:03,Twokinds,I think there's an iPhone 8
12-09-2018T14:02:21,Twokinds,And a Note 8
12-09-2018T14:02:40,Twokinds,etc
12-09-2018T14:03:20,SpazztasticKiwi,iPhone 7 and iPhone X actually
12-09-2018T14:03:40,SpazztasticKiwi,The X is supposed to mean “10”
12-09-2018T14:04:44,CrimsonQuill,Hello Tom!
12-09-2018T14:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured the Note 8 was one. I’ve just been wondering cause my phone was being a dick and I threatened out loud to just go ahead and upgrade (it stopped throwing its fit)
12-09-2018T14:05:04,CrimsonQuill,I don't use the iPhone.
12-09-2018T14:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Got me thinking of what other brands seem to skip an “8” model
12-09-2018T14:05:26,CrimsonQuill,Search me.
12-09-2018T14:06:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Personally I don’t want a 7 or X. They’re overkill to me and not different except for no headphone jack and a slightly better camera and a few other little things
12-09-2018T14:07:12,CrimsonQuill,I just have a vodafone phone.
12-09-2018T14:07:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Heard of those. I’ll keep my 6s+
12-09-2018T14:08:00,CrimsonQuill,Mine's ok.
12-09-2018T14:08:18,CrimsonQuill,It's got a bigger screen than an iPhone anway.
12-09-2018T14:08:31,CrimsonQuill,"What sort of phone do you use, Tom?"
12-09-2018T14:08:43,SpazztasticKiwi,More than 6ish inches?
12-09-2018T14:08:58,CrimsonQuill,about
12-09-2018T14:09:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool. I like mine just fine
12-09-2018T14:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,If I could “upgrade” and just get another one of my current model I’d be happy but I think it requires I get an upgrade model
12-09-2018T14:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t late for you crim
12-09-2018T14:11:35,CrimsonQuill,I like mine as it is.
12-09-2018T14:11:45,CrimsonQuill,I've only had it for a year anyway.
12-09-2018T14:11:46,SpazztasticKiwi,*Isn’t it late
12-09-2018T14:13:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"After my birthday, I’ll have had this phone for 2 years"
12-09-2018T14:14:08,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to try make mine last as long as possible.
12-09-2018T14:17:35,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s what you should strive to do with any device you buy
12-09-2018T14:18:05,CrimsonQuill,It's our family's general way about anythoing.
12-09-2018T14:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,And thinking on it I may benefit from a phone lacking a headphone jack because I cleaned my jack today and pulled out a lint monster
12-09-2018T14:19:58,Miftox01,Hey Guys
12-09-2018T14:20:02,Twokinds,I still have a Note 4 :D
12-09-2018T14:20:15,CrimsonQuill,I don't even know what that is. Sorry
12-09-2018T14:20:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t that an old model
12-09-2018T14:21:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure you take great care of it
12-09-2018T14:21:13,SpazztasticKiwi,One phone call per year
12-09-2018T14:21:14,SiliconCarbide,heey i had a note 4 as well
12-09-2018T14:21:36,SiliconCarbide,"untill I had to start travelling alot, that thing is so old, it can't use most of the frequencies outside where i bought it"
12-09-2018T14:23:22,Miftox01,"Did any of you also wish to forget everything you've read, when you finished the Comic, and wanted to Start again?"
12-09-2018T14:23:42,SpazztasticKiwi,My memory is so bad that’s basically what happens
12-09-2018T14:23:56,CrimsonQuill,Absolutely.
12-09-2018T14:24:11,CrimsonQuill,I wish I could start all over with a god mindset...
12-09-2018T14:24:25,Miftox01,You're lucky ':D spazz
12-09-2018T14:24:36,CrimsonQuill,"Impossible for me, considering I read it three times in the space of five months."
12-09-2018T14:24:50,Miftox01,Same XD
12-09-2018T14:25:12,CrimsonQuill,"I want to re-read it again, but I'm waiting for my Volume 4 to ship out. Keenspot still hasn't managed to get it going yet..."
12-09-2018T14:25:28,SpazztasticKiwi,It ships this month at least
12-09-2018T14:25:35,CrimsonQuill,I hope so.
12-09-2018T14:25:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if it’ll get here before my Jacksepticeye pin
12-09-2018T14:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Or on the same day
12-09-2018T14:26:09,CrimsonQuill,So while I wait I'm watching a five year old series by Tom's Brother Mark in the Last of Us-episode 5-Bill's Brilliant Bonanza.
12-09-2018T14:26:20,Miftox01,I am curious If there ist going to bei some other Merch than Mangas (or Comic books)
12-09-2018T14:26:30,Miftox01,*be
12-09-2018T14:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m hoping for pins
12-09-2018T14:26:57,CrimsonQuill,"Part 6, not 5"
12-09-2018T14:27:03,CrimsonQuill,"Also, i'll stick to the books"
12-09-2018T14:28:25,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister has taken a sudden liking to Mark recently for some reason
12-09-2018T14:28:34,Miftox01,"Hey spazz, have you ever met Jack in Person? I was in Brighton recently, but hast No Lück spotting him..."
12-09-2018T14:28:46,CrimsonQuill,I like both the brothers.
12-09-2018T14:29:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I met Jack at Pax east
12-09-2018T14:29:14,Miftox01,*luck
12-09-2018T14:29:21,CrimsonQuill,You lucky chap/
12-09-2018T14:29:33,Miftox01,Nice i envy you
12-09-2018T14:29:37,CrimsonQuill,"He has an Offaly accent, for certain."
12-09-2018T14:29:55,CrimsonQuill,You can hear it if you listen close-none of the Dublin Drawl.
12-09-2018T14:30:18,SpazztasticKiwi,His brother has a thicker Irish sound
12-09-2018T14:31:37,CrimsonQuill,Blame my Irish relations for knowing about accents
12-09-2018T14:31:39,Miftox01,"I have a hard time recognizing accents, since english ist Not my mother language"
12-09-2018T14:32:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Well there’s even separate accents with English speakers so don’t worry yourself too much about it
12-09-2018T14:32:31,Miftox01,"And sorry for my bad typing, autocorrect..."
12-09-2018T14:33:38,Miftox01,Brb
12-09-2018T14:33:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen worse
12-09-2018T14:38:38,Twokinds,I have a very thick Ohio accent
12-09-2018T14:38:47,Twokinds,This is why my handwriting is sometimes hard to read.
12-09-2018T14:39:17,CrimsonQuill,I guess one could tell listening to the Orc's must die playthrough....
12-09-2018T14:39:24,CrimsonQuill,"I can't tell though,"
12-09-2018T14:39:33,CrimsonQuill,I don't know US accents.
12-09-2018T14:40:16,Bgrmystr2,..tom please xD
12-09-2018T14:40:29,Bgrmystr2,accents have nothing to do with handwriting :P
12-09-2018T14:41:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I type very southern
12-09-2018T14:41:14,CrimsonQuill,I type English English
12-09-2018T14:41:26,CrimsonQuill,If my grammar actually is of acceptable standard.
12-09-2018T14:41:50,Bgrmystr2,"Same, kiwi, but it's not like you can't understand every word just cuz of the way it's said.."
12-09-2018T14:41:55,Bgrmystr2,cuz text doesn't work that way
12-09-2018T14:43:10,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s possible to have accent like properties in writing as well as speech but it’s not as noticeable or obvious or even visible
12-09-2018T14:43:28,Miftox01,"My German ist pretty normal, and i've Heard that my english ist a mixture of british and American english"
12-09-2018T14:44:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured you were German. A common thing that happens there is capitalizing nouns
12-09-2018T14:44:46,CrimsonQuill,"Then you have me, the noob, who can't tell these things apart at all."
12-09-2018T14:45:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t do that in my lessons and I feel my teacher AI is annoyed by it sometimes
12-09-2018T14:45:18,Miftox01,Yup one Strange difference that is difficult to overcome
12-09-2018T14:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,My only problem seems to be pronounciation
12-09-2018T14:46:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And some of the spelling
12-09-2018T14:46:41,SiliconCarbide,i think german has sensible spelling tho
12-09-2018T14:46:44,Miftox01,Where are you from?
12-09-2018T14:46:50,Miftox01,Spazz
12-09-2018T14:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,America. I’m learning German
12-09-2018T14:47:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Slowly
12-09-2018T14:47:14,Twokinds,I'm studying a bit of Korean
12-09-2018T14:47:26,CrimsonQuill,I'm terrible at languages.
12-09-2018T14:47:33,SpazztasticKiwi,With Mark? Niiiiice
12-09-2018T14:47:34,CrimsonQuill,What's Korean like?
12-09-2018T14:48:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I listen in on Mark doing those livestreams with y’all’s mom but I have no idea what’s going on
12-09-2018T14:48:10,Miftox01,In school or in YouTube freetime?
12-09-2018T14:48:22,Miftox01,Your*
12-09-2018T14:48:31,Miftox01,':D
12-09-2018T14:48:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom’s not the youtuber. His brother Mark is
12-09-2018T14:48:54,Miftox01,I mean the learning
12-09-2018T14:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Im learning in a German Duolingo group that Mark admins
12-09-2018T14:50:01,Miftox01,Wow sounds nice
12-09-2018T14:50:42,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s like two active people and I’m one of them
12-09-2018T14:51:18,CrimsonQuill,I'm just worried about how late I'll be trying to follow this chat.
12-09-2018T14:51:22,Miftox01,What was the first thing you learned?
12-09-2018T14:51:26,SpazztasticKiwi,We fight for first place on the leaderboard with our log in streaks and XP
12-09-2018T14:52:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Started out with “basics”
12-09-2018T14:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Frau, Mann, madchen, junge, er, sie, ihr, and so on"
12-09-2018T14:52:51,CrimsonQuill,@Miftox01 learned about what?
12-09-2018T14:52:54,CrimsonQuill,German?
12-09-2018T14:53:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also my autocorrect likes to try fixing my German into English so if something is spelled wrong, oops"
12-09-2018T14:53:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes German
12-09-2018T14:54:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Die, das, and der still cause me problems"
12-09-2018T14:54:54,Miftox01,I really love to speak in English because I want to improve my talking skills
12-09-2018T14:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,How’s your Korean going Tom?
12-09-2018T14:55:14,Miftox01,But I hardly ever get the chace
12-09-2018T14:55:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I know someone Georgian that watches Mark to help him learn English pronunciation
12-09-2018T14:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,He says it helps but I did advise him to make sure he doesn’t just watch one English speaker since the language can vary verbally with each native
12-09-2018T14:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, reading stuff in English and looking up words you don’t know can help (he does that too)"
12-09-2018T14:57:41,Miftox01,Always important yes

12-09-2018T15:01:53,Miftox01,Nice one Tom
12-09-2018T15:02:10,CrimsonQuill,"Katsassin's Creed-coming to consoles 2018,"
12-09-2018T15:02:39,Miftox01,"Hey Tom, did you ever consider coming to an German Comic Con?"
12-09-2018T15:02:47,Bgrmystr2,ooo that finished image is nice
12-09-2018T15:03:01,Miftox01,"Sorry, a German Comic Con"
12-09-2018T15:07:36,Miftox01,"I can barely find enough time to relax between my classtest, since I'm doing my ""Abitur"", so traveling to the us is out of the question for now..."
12-09-2018T15:08:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah testing time
12-09-2018T15:08:46,Miftox01,So I was hoping to meet you maybe at the comic Con in Leipzig or somewhere else
12-09-2018T15:09:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d go to Germany but I’d rather be able to read and speak German a little better before
12-09-2018T15:10:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And it’s also a bit expensive and I’d likely still get lost
12-09-2018T15:10:16,CrimsonQuill,I'd go to San Diego comic con if I could afford it.
12-09-2018T15:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m thinking of skipping SDCC
12-09-2018T15:10:32,Miftox01,That won't be a problem if you have someone you know to help you if it gets tricky
12-09-2018T15:10:59,Miftox01,Sdcc?
12-09-2018T15:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Traveling with someone else is something I don’t really have. San Diego Comic Con
12-09-2018T15:11:29,Miftox01,Ah ok
12-09-2018T15:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And I don’t want to be in San Diego alone being from across the country (literally) natively
12-09-2018T15:12:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Same goes for a Germany trip
12-09-2018T15:13:22,Miftox01,In Germany most of the students should be able to understand you even if they are to shy to really talk much
12-09-2018T15:14:02,Miftox01,And there are some Germans in this community too
12-09-2018T15:14:13,Twokinds,Ja
12-09-2018T15:14:16,Miftox01,Hi to them :D
12-09-2018T15:14:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you half qualify
12-09-2018T15:15:14,CrimsonQuill,Yep-'Fischbach'
12-09-2018T15:15:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I know a good bit of native Germans speak or understand English already
12-09-2018T15:15:30,Miftox01,So why don't ask them for help?
12-09-2018T15:15:52,SpazztasticKiwi,We had a guy from Germany spend a few years at our high school when I was still in school
12-09-2018T15:16:35,SpazztasticKiwi,He spoke and wrote English well. Only thing was he had an accent
12-09-2018T15:16:53,Miftox01,"Yeah Tom, I was curious if you have some German origins because of your name"
12-09-2018T15:17:06,Miftox01,A bad accent?
12-09-2018T15:17:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It sounded obviously German but very understandable
12-09-2018T15:18:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Tried teaching us some German words (only thing anyone really wanted to learn was the swearing)
12-09-2018T15:18:32,Miftox01,Like Hermann ze German? XD I wanted to visit that restaurant so badly...
12-09-2018T15:18:51,Miftox01,Understandable XD
12-09-2018T15:19:02,Miftox01,Do you remember any?
12-09-2018T15:19:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope. For some reason he didn’t really like me
12-09-2018T15:20:24,Miftox01,Harsh
12-09-2018T15:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,He and another foreign guy didn’t get along
12-09-2018T15:21:10,Miftox01,"We've had an American guy at our school as well, he was extremely friendly"
12-09-2018T15:21:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Marius was his name. He and a friend of mine who was half Korean hated each other
12-09-2018T15:23:11,Miftox01,Oh that's never good if your friend and him were on bad terms
12-09-2018T15:24:07,Miftox01,I'm actually thinking about emigrating to the US and well. For various reasons
12-09-2018T15:24:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well when Marius started being rude to me and Derick found out, Derick told him to stop."
12-09-2018T15:24:19,Miftox01,as well...
12-09-2018T15:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,This ply added to the reasons they hated each other. The feud was over something else I’m sure
12-09-2018T15:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,*only
12-09-2018T15:25:27,Miftox01,Not everyone likes everybody... Sad but true. I like keeping to the friendly people if possible
12-09-2018T15:27:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Once Derick started defending me, his friends started as well. I gained a lot of friends from that"
12-09-2018T15:27:42,Miftox01,That's nice
12-09-2018T15:27:57,Miftox01,I hope you still have contact
12-09-2018T15:28:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"With some, but it’s mainly gotten to where it the occasional hi if we see each other in public. Most have kids now"
12-09-2018T15:29:41,Miftox01,"Oh wow you have left school a while ago, haven't you. No offense by any means"
12-09-2018T15:30:16,Bgrmystr2,you'll meet a few people here that are much older than the usual crowd
12-09-2018T15:30:20,Bgrmystr2,myself included
12-09-2018T15:30:24,Bgrmystr2,it happens
12-09-2018T15:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Well Derick had his daughter very young because his girlfriend got pregnant on accident
12-09-2018T15:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,And he was in my grade but still a little older
12-09-2018T15:32:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I graduated in 2015. To me my graduating class started having kids really early
12-09-2018T15:33:13,SpazztasticKiwi,And some of these friends are a little older. I have a late birthday
12-09-2018T15:33:35,Miftox01,So not long ago. Are you studying or have you found work already?
12-09-2018T15:33:36,CrimsonQuill,I'm still in University...studying Surveying.
12-09-2018T15:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a job. One degree but it’s not important. Just a part of what I could do
12-09-2018T15:34:27,SpazztasticKiwi,One diploma I should say
12-09-2018T15:34:37,Miftox01,Around which age are you Bgrmystr? If I may ask
12-09-2018T15:34:58,Bgrmystr2,turned 30 this year
12-09-2018T15:35:01,Bgrmystr2,in july
12-09-2018T15:35:05,Miftox01,I hope you have fun at work
12-09-2018T15:35:19,Bgrmystr2,so I'm about 11 months and a few days younger than tom
12-09-2018T15:35:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve studied things from first aid and little bits of beginners medicine to art history and psychiatry and psychology
12-09-2018T15:35:38,Miftox01,That's not old by any means :)
12-09-2018T15:36:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Just one or two semesters worth. And I still don’t know what I’m completely interested in
12-09-2018T15:36:47,Miftox01,"I'm planning on becoming an engineer. I don't know how you would call ""Maschinenbau"" in English"
12-09-2018T15:37:01,Miftox01,But I want to study that
12-09-2018T15:37:25,Bgrmystr2,"of course 30 isn't old, but when the majority of the people that hang out seem to be in their late teens"
12-09-2018T15:37:33,Bgrmystr2,"mid-late teens, early 20s"
12-09-2018T15:37:46,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, it's a bit older than the general crowd"
12-09-2018T15:37:59,Miftox01,I mean I turned 17 last month
12-09-2018T15:38:16,Miftox01,Just a bit
12-09-2018T15:38:31,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re pretty close together
12-09-2018T15:38:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean my 22nd is in a few weeks but
12-09-2018T15:40:06,Miftox01,Yeah that's not far apart. But I bet you are way more responsible with your life that. I'm right now
12-09-2018T15:40:22,Miftox01,*than
12-09-2018T15:40:30,Miftox01,:)
12-09-2018T15:41:12,SpazztasticKiwi,That depends what you consider responsible I guess
12-09-2018T15:41:27,Miftox01,I won't turn eighteen before I had my final exams but oh well
12-09-2018T15:42:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have no debt, so that’s one thing. And I don’t have kids"
12-09-2018T15:42:39,Miftox01,"Responsible in like planning, scheduling and so on"
12-09-2018T15:42:50,Miftox01,No debt is always good
12-09-2018T15:43:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I consider myself a walking schedule
12-09-2018T15:43:44,Miftox01,:D
12-09-2018T15:43:54,Miftox01,XD
12-09-2018T15:44:50,SpazztasticKiwi,They like me enough at work. I’ve been asked to be a manager at least twice
12-09-2018T15:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"But as for social stuff, I’m not a huge people person"
12-09-2018T15:45:48,Miftox01,"Oh well, I have to try and be responsible for my sleeping schedule as well. So even if I have less lessons tomorrow than usually, I should still try to sleep right now. It's almost 11pm"
12-09-2018T15:46:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Sleeping schedule
12-09-2018T15:46:16,SpazztasticKiwi,That doesn’t exist for me
12-09-2018T15:46:25,Miftox01,XD
12-09-2018T15:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have a time I try to sleep but its either too hot, too cold, can’t get comfortable or my cat wants to walk all over me"
12-09-2018T15:46:57,Miftox01,"But you seem to do just fine with people to me, keep it up"
12-09-2018T15:47:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Online. Not much of a talker in person. Unless I know you
12-09-2018T15:47:37,Miftox01,Naww cats are cute. But I would still prefer a husky
12-09-2018T15:48:03,Miftox01,Maybe that will happen;D
12-09-2018T15:48:29,Miftox01,Anyway :) l have to sleep
12-09-2018T15:48:40,Miftox01,Good night y'all
12-09-2018T15:48:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Night night
12-09-2018T15:53:31,CrimsonQuill,Night Miftox
12-09-2018T15:54:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Thinking back to high school makes me wonder about that whole mess
12-09-2018T16:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m just gonna stick to forgetting it. Probably best if y’all do too
12-09-2018T16:10:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s about dinner time
12-09-2018T16:18:49,CrimsonQuill,I just made myself a bowl of rice with piri piri sprink;led on top for my dinner.
12-09-2018T16:19:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna have some fish n onion rings
12-09-2018T16:22:04,MidNightBlue78,I'm making hamburger soup
12-09-2018T16:22:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Oooooo
12-09-2018T16:22:14,MidNightBlue78,Please pray for me 😆
12-09-2018T16:22:21,CrimsonQuill,Fish Fingers and Custard!
12-09-2018T16:22:29,SpazztasticKiwi,🙏🏻
12-09-2018T16:23:05,MidNightBlue78,"it's got mixed vegetables,which means my son will hate me for the next few days"
12-09-2018T16:23:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unless you try cooking rice in a pressure cooker on the stove, you will not screw up as hard as I’ve seen people screw up"
12-09-2018T16:23:31,MidNightBlue78,But i told him he needs to eat it all if he wants some red velvet oreo cookies
12-09-2018T16:23:55,MidNightBlue78,i have messed up rice in a rice cooker
12-09-2018T16:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Bribery: the best form of parenting
12-09-2018T16:24:03,MidNightBlue78,I can mess up anything
12-09-2018T16:24:10,MidNightBlue78,Even relationships
12-09-2018T16:24:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel your pain. I do the same. I have picked some real winners
12-09-2018T16:25:03,MidNightBlue78,"yeah, very relatable"
12-09-2018T16:29:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve found a good guideline is to watch how they treat animals, service workers, and animals"
12-09-2018T16:29:35,SpazztasticKiwi,*and their parents
12-09-2018T16:30:16,CrimsonQuill,I'm off. Goodnight all!
12-09-2018T16:30:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Though that kind of thing goes for anyone you think of associating with
12-09-2018T16:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Night
12-09-2018T16:31:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m not sure it should be the only thing you go by
12-09-2018T16:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,All the luck with soup. May the vegetables be well hidden health ninjas
12-09-2018T16:35:45,MidNightBlue78,thank you 😆
12-09-2018T16:36:21,MidNightBlue78,"At this point, I'm too tired to hide the vegetables"
12-09-2018T16:36:29,MidNightBlue78,They'll be in plain sight
12-09-2018T16:36:41,MidNightBlue78,Just to increase his agony
12-09-2018T16:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I know one trick is to chop them up really well so he doesn’t notice them and can’t pick them out
12-09-2018T17:09:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember now I have an early shift tomorrow. The day is ruined
12-09-2018T17:10:56,MidNightBlue78,"but he's 13 years old, he needs to stop being a big picky baby"
12-09-2018T17:11:45,Bgrmystr2,"Sometimes you don't like certain foods. Part of life is being able to say ""I'm not okay being forced to eat something that I don't like the taste of"""
12-09-2018T17:11:47,Bgrmystr2,"also, ho"
12-09-2018T17:11:49,Bgrmystr2,..hi*
12-09-2018T17:11:50,Bgrmystr2,even
12-09-2018T17:16:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Being selective of what you want is ok. Being picky because you only want junk is not
12-09-2018T17:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I know a friend who’s adopted brother is so incredibly spoiled I despise being around him for longer than a few hours
12-09-2018T17:19:49,Bgrmystr2,yeah true
12-09-2018T17:19:56,Bgrmystr2,even I don't want candy and stuff all the time
12-09-2018T17:20:03,Bgrmystr2,I want proper foods sometimes too
12-09-2018T17:20:04,Bgrmystr2,:v
12-09-2018T17:20:20,MidNightBlue78,"he's picky, period"
12-09-2018T17:20:26,MidNightBlue78,He loves junk
12-09-2018T17:20:44,MidNightBlue78,"And also,ho..."
12-09-2018T17:20:50,MidNightBlue78,"I mean,hi"
12-09-2018T17:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s not just whatever he wants to eat. If he wants to watch tv, he can. If he wants to play on mommy’s phone, he can"
12-09-2018T17:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s been “promised” a boa for his birthday because he wants a pet snake. I just say that if that happens, he won’t be taking care of it, his dad will, and they’ll try rehoming it soon after"
12-09-2018T17:23:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I had my pet garter snake, I refused to bring it over for him to see. I knew he’d want to hold him and that wasn’t gonna happen"
12-09-2018T17:27:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway, hi back"
12-09-2018T17:56:33,Combak,"Hey @Twokinds, the link on the main site to the newest Patreon Sketch still leads to the dA upload of the previous sketch."
12-09-2018T17:59:42,Twokinds,Oh thanks
12-09-2018T18:11:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat assassin looks like she’s ready for a convention costume contest
12-09-2018T18:52:49,unsteddyphoenix,She defintely reminds me of an anime character that uses string-fu
12-09-2018T18:53:42,unsteddyphoenix,Except even cooler :ctwokinds-wink:
12-09-2018T19:52:35,SpazztasticKiwi,“Cutest costume goes to miss Kat” :ctwokinds-katdryer:
12-09-2018T21:32:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Sketchiest background characters I’ve seen so far
12-09-2018T22:47:17,Twokinds,"I hate when I click the back button, but then it doesn't go right away, so I click it again, and it goes back twice."
12-09-2018T22:47:26,Vatruvius,lol
12-09-2018T22:47:29,Vatruvius,I hate that too.
12-09-2018T22:47:34,Vatruvius,Some sights lock you in.
12-09-2018T22:47:37,Vatruvius,Those are the worst.
12-09-2018T22:47:45,Vatruvius,"Also, hi everyone! :ptv-greetings:"
12-09-2018T22:48:06,Bgrmystr2,"Hmm, sites really can't do that, it's only if you open it in a new tab"
12-09-2018T22:48:15,Bgrmystr2,it's based on the tab you're on
12-09-2018T22:48:44,Bgrmystr2,"opening one page in a new tab will be the first page it opened, and thus have nowhere to 'go back' to"
12-09-2018T22:49:03,Vatruvius,"Well I am not sure how, but some websites do in fact lock me in and I have to hit the back button far too often to get out. To the point where I just go to a new tab."
12-09-2018T22:49:12,Vatruvius,I know that Bgr.
12-09-2018T22:49:17,Vatruvius,That is not the case.
12-09-2018T22:49:33,Vatruvius,Those sites are rare though. Have not come across one in a long time.
12-09-2018T22:50:24,Vatruvius,"I think it has something to do with pop-ups on the site. So if the site has a lot of pop-ups then the back button removes one pop-up and so on. I think anyway, it is always the sites that are 90% ads."
12-09-2018T22:51:06,Bgrmystr2,"Hmm.. I haven't run across any websites that have messed with the back/forward buttons, so while that seems out of my knowledge, it also seems malicious, or at least being intentionally harmful."
12-09-2018T22:51:19,Bgrmystr2,all the popups I see are new windows
12-09-2018T22:52:31,Vatruvius,"Right, it is not malicious as my antivirus does not alert me to it blocking anything. But it has happened. Next time I come across one I will do more research as to what might be causing the issue but I am not actively looking for those sites."
12-09-2018T22:53:13,Vatruvius,You see what you started Tom?! One comment and then an explosion of text! Gah! XD
12-09-2018T22:54:06,Bgrmystr2,xD Tom's fault.
12-09-2018T22:54:35,Twokinds,Sorry!
12-09-2018T22:54:45,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-wink:
12-09-2018T22:54:57,Bgrmystr2,"it's okay tom, we forgive you"
12-09-2018T22:55:11,Twokinds,So what happens is that a website will redirect to another page
12-09-2018T22:55:14,Bgrmystr2,it's sort of your job to sew seeds of discord in this chat.. or whatever.
12-09-2018T22:55:23,Twokinds,"So when you hit back, it goes to the redirect, which takes you back to the page"
12-09-2018T22:55:28,Twokinds,So you end up in an loop.
12-09-2018T22:55:43,Bgrmystr2,ooh okay yeah I know that loop
12-09-2018T22:55:50,Bgrmystr2,the redirect is a page in itself
12-09-2018T22:55:52,Twokinds,Which is why it seems like it's trapping you. You just have to right click the back button and tell it to go back two spots.
12-09-2018T22:55:59,Bgrmystr2,yeah
12-09-2018T22:56:27,Vatruvius,"Yeah, that make sense."
12-09-2018T22:56:28,Bgrmystr2,or quickly clicking back twice works too
12-09-2018T22:56:51,Vatruvius,So the endless loop I described might be more than one redirect?
12-09-2018T22:57:03,funnyman42,Just popped in to say Hi and leave again.
12-09-2018T22:57:07,funnyman42,"So, Hi!"
12-09-2018T22:57:08,Bgrmystr2,"it could be, Vatru."
12-09-2018T22:57:22,Vatruvius,Bastards!
12-09-2018T22:57:29,Bgrmystr2,"when you click a link on some sites, it has a redirect page, like picarto for instance"
12-09-2018T22:57:47,Vatruvius,"Yup, I get those sometimes."
12-09-2018T22:57:50,Bgrmystr2,"it has a redirect site, though I don't think their page automatically loads the new page after a few seconds"
12-09-2018T22:58:13,Bgrmystr2,but yeah some sites have a redirect.. and the website you end up at.. might also be redirecting elsewhere
12-09-2018T22:58:32,Bgrmystr2,so then you have two layers of redirect you have to get past xD
12-09-2018T22:59:55,Vatruvius,"I did not realize this until earlier today, but one of my characters, Amber, looks like femColin + Clovis fur pattern. Almost anyway."

12-09-2018T23:01:37,Twokinds,"As the inventor of furries, you must C&D"
12-09-2018T23:01:55,Vatruvius,C&D?
12-09-2018T23:02:12,Vatruvius,"Also, you are the inventor of furries?"
12-09-2018T23:02:20,Twokinds,Cease and Desist
12-09-2018T23:02:26,Twokinds,And yes D:&lt;
12-09-2018T23:02:58,Vatruvius,"I mean, you did start pretty far back. I just have not done in depth research into the subject. Does Wikipedia know?"
12-09-2018T23:03:16,Vatruvius,Could put it on your resume.
12-09-2018T23:03:27,Twokinds,"Well, you know, they're sometimes mistaken."
12-09-2018T23:03:40,Twokinds,XD
12-09-2018T23:03:54,Vatruvius,And they are free edit I believe aren't they?
12-09-2018T23:04:12,Miftox01,"I just wanted to quickly wish the best of luck for the people, who are affected by the hurricane"
12-09-2018T23:04:23,Vatruvius,"Never use Wikipedia as a source, drilled into me since freshman year of high school."
12-09-2018T23:04:31,Bgrmystr2,"not entirely, Vatru. Anyone can edit Wikipedia, but changes are not usually kept."
12-09-2018T23:04:38,Vatruvius,I see.
12-09-2018T23:04:59,Bgrmystr2,"Because there's actually people who watch each page, and every single page has a history of every single change, all public"
12-09-2018T23:05:13,Vatruvius,Hmm...
12-09-2018T23:05:14,Bgrmystr2,"also, it has links to sources of what's written"
12-09-2018T23:05:38,Bgrmystr2,"so while yeah it can be vandalized, and has been done several times, it's not easy to keep false information on it"
12-09-2018T23:06:17,Vatruvius,"And Tom, as far as actually looking like femColin + Clovis, that is just an estimation. I would have to put pen to paper and actually get drawing what is in my head. That and I am pretty sure our universes are too different."
12-09-2018T23:07:07,Bgrmystr2,"if you don't want to use wiki as a knowledge source, you can always look at the material they link and use that as a source instead. Granted for school, you'd want to find more than just that, but yeah"
12-09-2018T23:07:21,Vatruvius,"The only similarities would be furries, humans, and that is about it."
12-09-2018T23:19:18,SpazztasticKiwi,You copied a base model how dare
12-09-2018T23:21:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice to see it’s all coming along. Maybe you’ll get it all finished before your golden days
12-09-2018T23:26:32,Vatruvius,I would never copy another person's work.
12-09-2018T23:27:23,Vatruvius,"It is just as everything was being built in my mind and I formed everything into shapes and figures and characters, over time, they appear similar to other work I have seen which makes sense but is its own thing entirely."
12-09-2018T23:28:16,Vatruvius,"Plus, I doubt I will be able to draw like Tom who had over a decade of experience while I have just a few months."
12-09-2018T23:28:34,Vatruvius,"A few months on paper no less, not even in Photoshop or anything."
12-09-2018T23:28:44,SpazztasticKiwi,You just gotta give yourself a decade then
12-09-2018T23:28:52,Dadrobit,&gt;.&gt; I like paper thank you very much
12-09-2018T23:29:32,SpazztasticKiwi,“These kids and their fancy computers” 👴
12-09-2018T23:30:04,Dadrobit,bah humbuc
12-09-2018T23:30:11,Dadrobit,humbug*
12-09-2018T23:36:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to be off
12-09-2018T23:36:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I shall return sometime tomorrow. Probably
12-09-2018T23:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Night Vat, Bgr, & Dadro"
12-09-2018T23:38:18,SpazztasticKiwi,& Tom and whoever else is here (I know you lurkers are there)
12-09-2018T23:38:53,Twokinds,I'm not here.
12-09-2018T23:43:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok. I take back your goodnight then
12-09-2018T23:47:09,Twokinds,D:&gt;
12-09-2018T23:47:13,Vatruvius,"That is certainly not something I look forward to doing research into, the legality of creating your own work and rights, etc."
12-09-2018T23:47:20,Twokinds,Hey wait a minute you didn't leave
12-09-2018T23:47:32,Vatruvius,Me?
12-09-2018T23:47:50,Twokinds,Obviously not
12-09-2018T23:47:55,Vatruvius,lol
12-09-2018T23:48:16,Vatruvius,Had to talk to the family.
12-09-2018T23:49:43,SpazztasticKiwi,“Had to”
12-09-2018T23:49:56,Vatruvius,Quite so.
12-09-2018T23:50:33,Vatruvius,"I believe it went something like this...*aghm* ""Boy! Get down here and talk to me!"""
12-09-2018T23:51:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Obligatory “be in the same room as others you’re related to but don’t relate to”
12-09-2018T23:51:46,Vatruvius,Yup.
12-09-2018T23:52:17,Vatruvius,I do not think my interests and my dad's interests could be further apart.
12-09-2018T23:52:25,Vatruvius,Same with views.
12-09-2018T23:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just not a terribly social person. I try talking about what I like and I’m met with :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
12-09-2018T23:55:02,SpazztasticKiwi,At family gatherings that is. Most of the time
12-09-2018T23:56:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"And I do want to point out - if your “You didn’t leave” comment was for me, Tom - that I said I “need” to go"
12-09-2018T23:56:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Not that I was going to any time soon
12-09-2018T23:58:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m gonna actually go now. Had to put a few last second comments in first. Nighty nite everyone but Tom since he’s not here
