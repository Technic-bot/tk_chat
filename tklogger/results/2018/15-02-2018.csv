15-02-2018T05:03:24,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah!
15-02-2018T05:03:29,unsteddyphoenix,She didnt seem very good
15-02-2018T05:03:41,Dadrobit,"The most recent discussion topic, not only did she steal an entire article for her ""piece"", she stole it from BMI"
15-02-2018T05:04:12,unsteddyphoenix,Implying that she got away with it the first time???
15-02-2018T05:04:28,unsteddyphoenix,What's BMI
15-02-2018T05:04:50,Dadrobit,BMI = Broadcast Music Inc. is a fooundation that specializes in maintaining and upholding copyrights.
15-02-2018T05:04:55,Dadrobit,foundation
15-02-2018T05:05:09,Dadrobit,And making sure people get credited and paid for their work
15-02-2018T05:06:06,Dadrobit,It's the top foundation in the US besides SESAC and ASCAP who all do more or less the same thing.
15-02-2018T05:06:13,unsteddyphoenix,The delicious irony has become
15-02-2018T05:06:17,unsteddyphoenix,even more delicious
15-02-2018T05:06:25,unsteddyphoenix,She cant keep getting AWAY WITH IT
15-02-2018T05:06:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, gonna stay after class next time and just face to face with the teacher on this."
15-02-2018T05:07:51,unsteddyphoenix,You snitch! /s
15-02-2018T05:07:59,unsteddyphoenix,It's absurd that she hasnt been caught
15-02-2018T05:07:59,Dadrobit,"It's actually bullshit. I dunno what her grade is, but I fuckin' work for my A's, and I'll be damned if she gets to pull anything higher than an F."
15-02-2018T05:08:16,unsteddyphoenix,Nah seriously though fair enough
15-02-2018T05:08:24,unsteddyphoenix,How fustrating
15-02-2018T05:09:07,Dadrobit,It really is...
15-02-2018T05:11:25,Dadrobit,"Bleh, now I'm peeved."

15-02-2018T05:12:26,unsteddyphoenix,You are enemies with everyone including yourself
15-02-2018T05:12:28,unsteddyphoenix,?
15-02-2018T05:12:52,Dadrobit,And possibly canniballistic.
15-02-2018T05:13:16,Dadrobit,But mostly just angry mumbling and rambling.
15-02-2018T05:13:46,Bgrmystr2,"You tell that teacher what for, Dadro"
15-02-2018T05:13:49,Bgrmystr2,I'd be pissed too
15-02-2018T05:13:57,Bgrmystr2,"fuck some of that, yo"
15-02-2018T05:15:45,unsteddyphoenix,Im so mad I could eat a WHOLE PERSON
15-02-2018T05:16:55,Dadrobit,Without ranch even.
15-02-2018T05:19:03,unsteddyphoenix,a bowl of people
15-02-2018T05:19:09,Dadrobit,"If I can ever use this quote even once on some unsuspecting bastard at some point in my life, I will be happy"

15-02-2018T05:19:40,unsteddyphoenix,yo that would stretch the voice acting ability
15-02-2018T05:20:03,Dadrobit,This lady is legitimately probably the kind of person who pours her milk before her cereal.
15-02-2018T05:20:12,unsteddyphoenix,absolutely haram
15-02-2018T05:20:43,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I don't do that, but I don't see anything wrong with it :ptv-wondering:"
15-02-2018T05:21:00,Dadrobit,shudders
15-02-2018T05:21:07,Bgrmystr2,it's not like it's the chocolate powder for hot cocoa that has to mix into your milk
15-02-2018T05:21:21,Bgrmystr2,so it's totally irrelevant what order it's in
15-02-2018T05:22:29,Dadrobit,It makes it harder if not impossible to obtain the same volume of cereal in addition to causing potential splash issues.
15-02-2018T05:22:49,Dadrobit,barbarian
15-02-2018T05:23:07,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: hm, yeah that's true"
15-02-2018T05:23:29,Bgrmystr2,I never really thought about it cuz I haven't eaten cereal since I was a kid
15-02-2018T05:23:58,Dadrobit,The more you know

15-02-2018T06:04:23,unsteddyphoenix,Some american I met had some
15-02-2018T06:04:28,unsteddyphoenix,I could feel my teeth eroding
15-02-2018T06:04:30,Bgrmystr2,it definitely depends on your tastes

15-02-2018T06:34:22,Bgrmystr2,She may or may not look somewhat like a catfish depending on where you look at her. :ptv-wondering:
15-02-2018T06:35:10,Dadrobit,I don't know how to read that sentance.

15-02-2018T15:05:51,MidnightBlue78,I did
15-02-2018T15:06:00,MidnightBlue78,They expired today i guess

15-02-2018T15:06:18,MidnightBlue78,rip tk emotes
15-02-2018T15:06:22,TheBeckoner,So I'm not crazy.
15-02-2018T15:06:35,TheBeckoner,I keep considering them...
15-02-2018T15:06:36,MidnightBlue78,You were awesome while i had you
15-02-2018T15:06:50,TheBeckoner,It's for like a month or something right?
15-02-2018T15:06:58,MidnightBlue78,yes
15-02-2018T15:07:10,MidnightBlue78,"You can pay for 1 month, 2 or 3"
15-02-2018T15:07:26,MidnightBlue78,Last time i got them i got them for 3 months
15-02-2018T15:08:02,MidnightBlue78,Fun fact: Did you know that i was Tom's first subscriber?
15-02-2018T15:09:03,TheBeckoner,Didn't know that.
15-02-2018T15:09:17,TheBeckoner,When did he start doing subscriptions?
15-02-2018T15:10:01,MidnightBlue78,hmmm
15-02-2018T15:10:11,MidnightBlue78,I dont even remember
15-02-2018T15:10:20,MidnightBlue78,It was this past year
15-02-2018T15:11:47,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
15-02-2018T15:12:08,TheBeckoner,So I just got a call for the lady who I assume had this number before me or something. I've had this number for like 6 years and Im still getting calls for this woman. From what I gather she owns ludicrous amounts of money to basically everyone.
15-02-2018T15:12:22,MidnightBlue78,hi Thomas!!! :ptv-dealwithit:
15-02-2018T15:12:23,iliar,"Hi, Tom!"
15-02-2018T15:12:30,TheBeckoner,Heyo Tom.
15-02-2018T15:12:33,iliar,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
15-02-2018T15:12:45,wolfspartan1,hi tom
15-02-2018T15:13:13,Twokinds,Picarto recently had some intigrations with something called Streamlabs
15-02-2018T15:13:30,Twokinds,I've been looking into it and might use it to add some fun stuff.
15-02-2018T15:14:55,MidnightBlue78,what exactly is it?
15-02-2018T15:14:59,TheBeckoner,I got an email about that.
15-02-2018T15:15:16,MidnightBlue78,I didnt get any email regarding that
15-02-2018T15:15:26,MidnightBlue78,So i have no clue
15-02-2018T15:16:15,MidnightBlue78,"dang, that means i need to get my subscription back"
15-02-2018T15:16:23,Twokinds,From what I can tell it's adds features to streams. I don't know for sure.
15-02-2018T15:16:33,Twokinds,Comes with a sort of skinned obs
15-02-2018T15:16:53,Twokinds,"let's you do things like give people points and display subscribers on stream, etc"
15-02-2018T15:17:20,MidnightBlue78,"Ooh, sweet x3"
15-02-2018T15:43:02,Bgrmystr2,I remember when everyone got the email but me :ptv-unimpressed:
15-02-2018T15:43:51,Bgrmystr2,they didn't send it to me
15-02-2018T15:43:55,Bgrmystr2,just checked
15-02-2018T15:44:02,Bgrmystr2,fail.
15-02-2018T15:46:37,Bgrmystr2,I have every single notification for news enabled
15-02-2018T15:48:24,BadFoMo,I don't think I got an Email too.
15-02-2018T16:01:57,TheBeckoner,I can forward it to y'all if you really want. Just whisper.
15-02-2018T16:22:34,JaydenMozingo,Hello everyone.
15-02-2018T16:31:39,wolfspartan1,hi jay bye jay :P

15-02-2018T18:14:35,wolfspartan1,doing good just got done cleaning my pc
15-02-2018T18:23:10,CrRAR,nice
15-02-2018T18:23:27,CrRAR,you round up plenty of dust bunnies?
15-02-2018T18:23:39,wolfspartan1,yep
15-02-2018T18:33:10,CrRAR,do any cable organization?
15-02-2018T18:33:35,CrRAR,I always have high hope for that when I clean mine but it just always goes downhill so quickly.
15-02-2018T18:34:07,wolfspartan1,i do inside the pc but as for outside... cx
15-02-2018T18:35:34,CrRAR,"Yeah, lately inside and out I literally just settle at is it plugged in and not blocking any fans? DONE"
15-02-2018T18:35:56,CrRAR,#teamspahgettimess
15-02-2018T18:36:46,wolfspartan1,lol what are your pc specs
15-02-2018T18:37:31,CrRAR,uhh I just upgraded to a 980 Ti! Old but still solid.
15-02-2018T18:37:40,Bgrmystr2,"""old"" k"
15-02-2018T18:37:46,CrRAR,A 4790k for processor
15-02-2018T18:38:28,CrRAR,"Maxxed RAM 32GB, it's pretty goood"
15-02-2018T18:38:50,CrRAR,"The cas is the oldest thing, it's an original Antec P180"
15-02-2018T18:39:05,wolfspartan1,i got an i3 16gb of ram and gtx1060
15-02-2018T18:39:25,CrRAR,ahhh ya got me beat in the gfx dept lol
15-02-2018T18:39:29,wolfspartan1,i'm saving up for an ssd
15-02-2018T18:39:49,wolfspartan1,lol i need a better cpu
15-02-2018T18:39:55,CrRAR,i was looking at the numbers and the 1XXX series is a YUUUGE improvement.
15-02-2018T18:40:01,CrRAR,yeah
15-02-2018T18:40:24,CrRAR,"Processors don't need to be super new, if gaming is mainly your thing."
15-02-2018T18:40:24,Bgrmystr2,What do you do that even uses all that power? lol
15-02-2018T18:40:46,CrRAR,EVERYTHING XD
15-02-2018T18:41:07,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-unimpressed: ya ok. That's the same as saying ""Nothing"""
15-02-2018T18:41:10,wolfspartan1,youtube/gaming x3
15-02-2018T18:41:14,CrRAR,GOTTA GO FAST
15-02-2018T18:41:27,Bgrmystr2,"I can youtube and game, and I've got a rig from '09"
15-02-2018T18:41:41,CrRAR,Good specs are great for emulation and processing... stuff.
15-02-2018T18:41:50,wolfspartan1,yeah but pretty mods
15-02-2018T18:42:00,Bgrmystr2,I can do pretty mods too
15-02-2018T18:42:07,CrRAR,gotta mine them cryptos kids
15-02-2018T18:42:12,Bgrmystr2,that's all GPU
15-02-2018T18:42:31,wolfspartan1,no don't mine those cryptos
15-02-2018T18:42:41,Bgrmystr2,"good, cuz you'd never make any money anyway"
15-02-2018T18:42:44,CrRAR,(I hear they'll be slightly better than bottlecaps in the GLORIOUS future)
15-02-2018T18:42:45,Bgrmystr2,not with your build
15-02-2018T18:43:00,CrRAR,haha
15-02-2018T18:43:26,wolfspartan1,cryptos is why gpu are so high in price
15-02-2018T18:43:39,Bgrmystr2,You need an impossibly powerful set of specific components to get a return on digital currency
15-02-2018T18:43:57,CrRAR,yeah! I bought my 980 literally right befor it went nuts!
15-02-2018T18:44:08,Bgrmystr2,even the power users wouldn't be able to do it.
15-02-2018T18:44:22,CrRAR,I checked eBay at one point later after hearing that and the prices were at lik 500
15-02-2018T18:44:27,wolfspartan1,with all those powerful parts i hate to see there energy bill
15-02-2018T18:44:34,CrRAR,I got mine for 350ish
15-02-2018T18:44:40,Bgrmystr2,"the bill is irrelevant, wolf"
15-02-2018T18:44:46,CrRAR,Yeah
15-02-2018T18:44:51,wolfspartan1,mine was 250 now its like 350
15-02-2018T18:44:55,Bgrmystr2,"if you get the proper parts, the price of the system is nothing."
15-02-2018T18:46:02,CrRAR,mining was always stupid back when you could mine whole coins or whatever the were only worth like fifty cents... but then the value went insane.
15-02-2018T18:46:18,CrRAR,Bitcoins themselves are now impossible because of ASIC hardware
15-02-2018T18:46:24,wolfspartan1,just saying running a high spec pc all day i'd hate to pay that energy bill
15-02-2018T18:46:40,CrRAR,"Yeah no I do it a little for the luls, I got exactly .02 Zcashes. XD"
15-02-2018T18:46:51,Bgrmystr2,"it's a pity that the prices for all the good hardware went up, but it's not really a big deal considering you can do a surprising amount with very little hardware."
15-02-2018T18:47:24,Bgrmystr2,lotta ppl overestimate the amount of power they need for what they plan to do
15-02-2018T18:47:25,wolfspartan1,i will own a gtx 1080 one day
15-02-2018T18:47:41,Bgrmystr2,"and at the same time, underestimate the power needed for digital currency"
15-02-2018T18:47:43,CrRAR,"These days it's totally just easier to play the market with real monies, but yeah it's so volatile and silly."
15-02-2018T18:48:23,CrRAR,I can't believe how much the top cards still are.
15-02-2018T18:48:25,wolfspartan1,i made the mistake of buying a huge pc case
15-02-2018T18:48:37,Bgrmystr2,why is that a mistake?
15-02-2018T18:48:52,Bgrmystr2,future-proofing your system is never a mistake
15-02-2018T18:49:00,CrRAR,"I have a mid-tower ATX, it's has it pros and cons."
15-02-2018T18:49:10,CrRAR,Full-towers are nuts.
15-02-2018T18:49:11,wolfspartan1,eh i feel it is too big
15-02-2018T18:49:27,CrRAR,Is it a full tower?
15-02-2018T18:49:33,wolfspartan1,mhm
15-02-2018T18:49:55,wolfspartan1,this thing is like three fett i think
15-02-2018T18:49:59,wolfspartan1,feet
15-02-2018T18:50:20,Bgrmystr2,"I've got a mid tower case, and it doesn't feel big at all. In fact, it's rather average. Room for a decent amount of stuff, but nothing too extravagant"
15-02-2018T18:50:31,CrRAR,yeah
15-02-2018T18:50:33,CrRAR,I mean yeah it's not too big of a mistake considering Full graphics cards are lik e12 or 13 inches.
15-02-2018T18:50:38,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I want a full tower"
15-02-2018T18:50:50,Bgrmystr2,"something bigger than this, preferrably"
15-02-2018T18:50:58,wolfspartan1,i was wrong its not three feet
15-02-2018T18:51:04,CrRAR,It's cozy in my midtower fitting the 980 in there
15-02-2018T18:51:04,Bgrmystr2,"but this was like $60 or so, so no big deal"
15-02-2018T18:51:23,wolfspartan1,17 1/2 inches
15-02-2018T18:51:30,Bgrmystr2,"what tower did you get, Cr?"
15-02-2018T18:51:32,CrRAR,Super good for keeping things cool
15-02-2018T18:51:51,CrRAR,Mine's an Antec P180
15-02-2018T18:51:57,CrRAR,circa 2007 XD
15-02-2018T18:52:01,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: Antec
15-02-2018T18:52:02,Bgrmystr2,ew
15-02-2018T18:52:02,wolfspartan1,yep it even supports water cooling
15-02-2018T18:52:09,CrRAR,I have a mini build in a EVGA Hadron Air
15-02-2018T18:52:26,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't touch Antec myself, such a 3rd party company"
15-02-2018T18:52:26,CrRAR,I liked Antec because of their solid PSUs!
15-02-2018T18:52:39,wolfspartan1,i wanna build a 2nd pc for gaming on vista
15-02-2018T18:52:43,Bgrmystr2,pass on anything from them
15-02-2018T18:52:45,CrRAR,For some reason those two things matching meant a lot to me in 2007
15-02-2018T18:52:51,CrRAR,XD
15-02-2018T18:52:58,Bgrmystr2,Vista?
15-02-2018T18:52:59,Bgrmystr2,wolf
15-02-2018T18:53:01,Bgrmystr2,are you crazy
15-02-2018T18:53:02,CrRAR,I be sure to pass that on to younger me
15-02-2018T18:53:08,wolfspartan1,i like vista shush
15-02-2018T18:53:13,Bgrmystr2,vista is trash though
15-02-2018T18:53:16,Bgrmystr2,why would you like it
15-02-2018T18:53:16,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-02-2018T18:53:36,CrRAR,"I loved Vista too at the time, it was solid with the right parts and drivers!"
15-02-2018T18:53:40,CrRAR,but it did suck
15-02-2018T18:53:40,wolfspartan1,it was on the family pc as i grew up
15-02-2018T18:53:45,Bgrmystr2,"Vista is basically 7, but inefficient as hell"
15-02-2018T18:53:49,CrRAR,yeah
15-02-2018T18:54:08,Bgrmystr2,"and the UAC is legitimately intended to be annoying and in your face, coming from a dev who actually worked on it"
15-02-2018T18:54:10,wolfspartan1,its more for a throw back really
15-02-2018T18:54:31,Bgrmystr2,there was an article I read about vista and had ppl who worked on it
15-02-2018T18:54:52,CrRAR,They did add a lot of gimicky features that were cool like the live backgrounds and whatever I forget what that was called
15-02-2018T18:54:57,Bgrmystr2,"and they said the UAC was legitimately there to waste your time, and they knew full-well it barely had any value for a defense mechanism"
15-02-2018T18:55:04,CrRAR,Screen... something
15-02-2018T18:55:10,Bgrmystr2,dunno
15-02-2018T18:55:16,Bgrmystr2,I disabled all that trash when I had vista
15-02-2018T18:55:20,CrRAR,XD
15-02-2018T18:55:22,Bgrmystr2,Aero is so fucking slow
15-02-2018T18:55:25,CrRAR,yeah
15-02-2018T18:55:26,Bgrmystr2,such a waste of resources.
15-02-2018T18:55:41,CrRAR,That was the heyday of UI modification too though
15-02-2018T18:55:48,CrRAR,I loved those days XD
15-02-2018T18:55:51,Bgrmystr2,Please.
15-02-2018T18:55:54,Bgrmystr2,Not even.
15-02-2018T18:56:04,Bgrmystr2,Windows 98SE had more customization than Vista did
15-02-2018T18:56:04,CrRAR,I liked the simple ones.
15-02-2018T18:56:19,wolfspartan1,how about 8.1?
15-02-2018T18:56:22,CrRAR,"Not the built in stuff, the mods."
15-02-2018T18:56:42,CrRAR,I'm actually running 8.1
15-02-2018T18:56:49,wolfspartan1,how
15-02-2018T18:56:54,Bgrmystr2,"Vista was just ""Pick between a bunch of shitty pre-selected things that take resources and don't look good"""
15-02-2018T18:56:57,Bgrmystr2,That was about it
15-02-2018T18:56:58,wolfspartan1,8.1 annoyed me
15-02-2018T18:57:10,CrRAR,Honestly
15-02-2018T18:57:21,CrRAR,I just hit the windows button and type what I want
15-02-2018T18:57:37,CrRAR,Like I don't even look at the menu ever really
15-02-2018T18:57:43,Bgrmystr2,you can do that with 7
15-02-2018T18:57:47,Bgrmystr2,the search function
15-02-2018T18:57:47,CrRAR,The W10 menu pisses me off
15-02-2018T18:57:52,CrRAR,yeah
15-02-2018T18:57:53,wolfspartan1,i'm running windows 10
15-02-2018T18:58:02,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't touch 10 with a 30 foot pole
15-02-2018T18:58:05,Bgrmystr2,do not want
15-02-2018T18:58:39,CrRAR,I always played around with the Technical Previews  so jumped to 8 when it came out.
15-02-2018T18:59:08,CrRAR,I just like 8.1 now because it's more like Windows 7 yjan 10 is and it'll be good till 2023.
15-02-2018T18:59:11,wolfspartan1,i hated the side bar thing in 8.1
15-02-2018T18:59:15,CrRAR,Sadly 7 dies in 2020
15-02-2018T18:59:21,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
15-02-2018T18:59:27,wolfspartan1,rip 7
15-02-2018T18:59:38,CrRAR,Oh yeah the side bars are extra dumb
15-02-2018T18:59:47,Bgrmystr2,I didn't. I don't like being other people's guinea pig for free.
15-02-2018T18:59:57,Bgrmystr2,"Also, 7 doesn't die"
15-02-2018T19:00:00,Bgrmystr2,the support for it dies
15-02-2018T19:00:04,Bgrmystr2,there is a difference.
15-02-2018T19:00:19,CrRAR,No more security updates tho
15-02-2018T19:00:22,Bgrmystr2,it's not like my system will magically stop working after 2020
15-02-2018T19:00:32,Bgrmystr2,that's not really relevant cuz security from the OS is trash anyway
15-02-2018T19:00:39,CrRAR,"Oh yeah no, it'll keep going and going"
15-02-2018T19:00:49,Bgrmystr2,you think there aren't millions of exploits right now on windows 10 that users don
15-02-2018T19:00:53,Bgrmystr2,don't know about?
15-02-2018T19:01:07,CrRAR,oh hell yeah
15-02-2018T19:01:09,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't matter what the security of the OS is
15-02-2018T19:01:11,wolfspartan1,people still use vista
15-02-2018T19:01:25,Bgrmystr2,it makes no difference if Microsoft releases security updates for 7 or not
15-02-2018T19:01:26,wolfspartan1,and the support for that died
15-02-2018T19:01:26,CrRAR,yeah and like .03% are still on XP
15-02-2018T19:01:28,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-02-2018T19:01:42,Bgrmystr2,I'd be using XP still if it had a decent 64bit version
15-02-2018T19:01:48,CrRAR,(It's actually probably a higher percent than that)
15-02-2018T19:02:04,CrRAR,The problem the older the OS gets is driver support.
15-02-2018T19:02:25,Bgrmystr2,I won't be using 7 as a primary OS in the future anyway
15-02-2018T19:02:34,CrRAR,mmm
15-02-2018T19:02:51,wolfspartan1,i got a question
15-02-2018T19:02:53,Bgrmystr2,Virtual machines are your friend
15-02-2018T19:03:14,CrRAR,I &lt;3 Virtual Machines
15-02-2018T19:03:17,CrRAR,I used XP 64bit edition almost exclusively
15-02-2018T19:03:21,CrRAR,back when
15-02-2018T19:03:33,Bgrmystr2,"I don't run one right now, but I'm planning to use 7 as my primary OS running it on a VM"
15-02-2018T19:03:56,Bgrmystr2,"that way, if something infects the system, it infects 7, not the core"
15-02-2018T19:04:00,CrRAR,"I love that it was actually labeled ""64 bit Edition"" looking back, that's so laughable."
15-02-2018T19:04:03,Bgrmystr2,and I can just reload it from before I did it
15-02-2018T19:04:07,wolfspartan1,i need to find a gpu to fit into a prebuilt pc
15-02-2018T19:04:16,Bgrmystr2,"it was technically 64 bit though, Cr"
15-02-2018T19:04:31,Bgrmystr2,"that's your first problem, wolf."
15-02-2018T19:04:34,Bgrmystr2,"""prebuilt"" lol"
15-02-2018T19:04:44,wolfspartan1,lol i know
15-02-2018T19:04:56,wolfspartan1,my gaming pc isn't pre built
15-02-2018T19:05:00,Bgrmystr2,you can measure the inside of it and then look at the length of cards online
15-02-2018T19:05:05,Bgrmystr2,it's not difficult
15-02-2018T19:05:07,wolfspartan1,this is for an old pc i have
15-02-2018T19:05:35,wolfspartan1,i just need something powerful enough to run halo ce and 2
15-02-2018T19:06:02,CrRAR,That's like anything that isn't 9 years old haha
15-02-2018T19:06:37,wolfspartan1,i'm not very good with computer parts yet i know a little
15-02-2018T19:07:09,CrRAR,I wonder how well integrated GFX would play those these days?
15-02-2018T19:07:31,CrRAR,obs framerates wouldn't be super good but they are pretty classic titles.
15-02-2018T19:07:45,wolfspartan1,i wouldn't know
15-02-2018T19:08:14,wolfspartan1,when i played halo 2 on the other pc it ran...[badly]
15-02-2018T19:08:25,CrRAR,ouchies
15-02-2018T19:08:29,CrRAR,lol
15-02-2018T19:08:31,wolfspartan1,like 12 fps
15-02-2018T19:08:40,CrRAR,hoooo boy
15-02-2018T19:08:43,CrRAR,yeah that's bad
15-02-2018T19:08:50,Bgrmystr2,well yeah Halo 2 still needs some decent hardware
15-02-2018T19:08:57,Bgrmystr2,integrated gpus are garbage
15-02-2018T19:08:59,Bgrmystr2,always have been
15-02-2018T19:09:01,Bgrmystr2,always will be
15-02-2018T19:09:06,wolfspartan1,the cpu is ok
15-02-2018T19:09:07,CrRAR,"I didn't thin kit would be that low, what machine was that?"
15-02-2018T19:09:12,Bgrmystr2,compared to the full-scale gpu cards
15-02-2018T19:09:15,CrRAR,mmm
15-02-2018T19:09:31,wolfspartan1,i just need a gpu to run it
15-02-2018T19:09:54,CrRAR,I've played Portal 2 like kinda ok on a machine from 2011
15-02-2018T19:10:07,CrRAR,I def remember frame drops though
15-02-2018T19:10:46,CrRAR,to be fair Portal is a mostly empty spaces game XD
15-02-2018T19:10:48,wolfspartan1,halo 2 on windows 10 sucks
15-02-2018T19:11:08,CrRAR,most things on W10 suck hahaha
15-02-2018T19:11:29,CrRAR,Like the fact there's still TWO DAMN  CONTROL PANELS
15-02-2018T19:11:35,Bgrmystr2,&gt; expecting things to not suck on an OS that sucks xD
15-02-2018T19:11:42,CrRAR,"fix it Msft, fix it!"
15-02-2018T19:11:46,Bgrmystr2,they won't fix it
15-02-2018T19:11:51,Bgrmystr2,Windows 10 is not made for power users
15-02-2018T19:11:56,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
15-02-2018T19:11:59,Bgrmystr2,it's made for people who don't use PCs at all
15-02-2018T19:12:07,CrRAR,tru
15-02-2018T19:12:09,CrRAR,so tru
15-02-2018T19:12:18,Bgrmystr2,for the ppl obsessed with the touchscreen smartphones where the computer is smarter than they are
15-02-2018T19:12:23,wolfspartan1,the cutsceens in the game flicker
15-02-2018T19:12:26,Bgrmystr2,that's what they've been pushing since after windows 7
15-02-2018T19:12:29,Bgrmystr2,and I'm not having any of it
15-02-2018T19:12:42,Bgrmystr2,7 was the last OS actually dedicated to power users
15-02-2018T19:12:42,CrRAR,yeah
15-02-2018T19:12:50,Bgrmystr2,everything afterwards was developed in mind for the stupids
15-02-2018T19:13:08,Bgrmystr2,"and the more you know about pcs, the more clear it is."
15-02-2018T19:13:14,CrRAR,I do like they added a GPU meter to the Task Manager in the latest W10 release... like build 1709
15-02-2018T19:13:55,Bgrmystr2,I barely even use the task manager beyond closing active programs that lock up
15-02-2018T19:14:10,Bgrmystr2,"informational, sure, but I can guess without even looking at it"
15-02-2018T19:14:13,CrRAR,yeah
15-02-2018T19:14:20,CrRAR,That's what I liked about 8 + 8.1 it still felt like they cared a little about power users with the file transfer graphs and the first upgraded Task Manager
15-02-2018T19:14:37,CrRAR,"with the ""heatmap"" thingy"
15-02-2018T19:14:45,Bgrmystr2,"I don't need it, cuz I generally already know there's a problem before I'd look to see if there is a problem at all"
15-02-2018T19:14:54,CrRAR,oh yeah totally
15-02-2018T19:14:56,qwe304,windows 10 can be configured to be acceptable
15-02-2018T19:15:02,CrRAR,yeah
15-02-2018T19:15:21,qwe304,"mostly by turning off all its ""features"""
15-02-2018T19:15:23,CrRAR,It is getting a little teensy bit better with the latest builds.
15-02-2018T19:15:38,CrRAR,Did you hear ULTRA PERFORMANCE mode is coming?
15-02-2018T19:15:41,CrRAR,XD
15-02-2018T19:15:47,wolfspartan1,lol
15-02-2018T19:15:53,CrRAR,"like what!? Msft, really?"
15-02-2018T19:16:05,Bgrmystr2,"I can't say the same, Cr. When I saw windows 8, it was literally 100% touchscreen phone as a computer OS, with all of the very little benefits a touchscreen phone comes with.. and all of the MANY drawbacks it took away when changing from the win7 setup"
15-02-2018T19:16:16,Bgrmystr2,and most computers don't have touchscreen displays
15-02-2018T19:16:32,Bgrmystr2,not even using the strongest gimmik of 8
15-02-2018T19:16:34,CrRAR,Oh yeah where Msft was going was completely stupid with it.
15-02-2018T19:16:41,Bgrmystr2,that was dumb as hell
15-02-2018T19:17:03,Bgrmystr2,"my problem is that the built the OS from the ground up to do that, not just on the surface"
15-02-2018T19:17:16,CrRAR,"So bad that they had to make W10, I just don't understand how tone deaf they had to be to think NOONE was going to use a mouse/keyboard."
15-02-2018T19:17:17,Bgrmystr2,and that's what the biggest problem is
15-02-2018T19:17:52,Bgrmystr2,"MS is all trying to be future-y with lack of mouse and keyboard, but it's only catering to people who don't use pcs at all"
15-02-2018T19:17:59,Bgrmystr2,there's literally nothing for power users of today
15-02-2018T19:18:10,CrRAR,"oh yeah, the sillier thing was seeing ppl going to the stor buying the cheapest computer with no touchscreen. Msft probably was just sitting there sh*tting themselves. XD"
15-02-2018T19:18:13,Bgrmystr2,who do they think is gonna create the next gen of computers? Seriously?
15-02-2018T19:18:26,Bgrmystr2,"shitting themselves with money, Cr"
15-02-2018T19:18:30,Bgrmystr2,cuz ppl are gonna buy it anyway
15-02-2018T19:18:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz they're not smart enough to see past Microsoft's blatant money gran
15-02-2018T19:18:41,Bgrmystr2,grab* even
15-02-2018T19:18:44,CrRAR,I think they really thought they could sway the market toward the GLORIOUS FUTURE
15-02-2018T19:18:56,CrRAR,but it was so dumb
15-02-2018T19:20:30,CrRAR,Oh yeah they knew people would buy it no matter what
15-02-2018T19:21:22,CrRAR,plus they wanted to push the app store which is still an abysmal failure.
15-02-2018T19:23:11,wolfspartan1,i hate the app store
15-02-2018T19:23:50,CrRAR,"Yeah, the developers of those apps put so little effort into them, so most are lousy."
15-02-2018T19:24:21,CrRAR,Even when it's a big company the Windows app is always terrible.
15-02-2018T19:25:40,wolfspartan1,the xbox one also annoys me
15-02-2018T19:33:12,CrRAR,"The naming scheme really has lived up to the memes now, hasn't it haha"
15-02-2018T19:33:25,wolfspartan1,lol yeah
15-02-2018T19:33:42,CrRAR,xXbox One Xx
15-02-2018T19:34:02,CrRAR,Crrrrringy~
15-02-2018T19:35:04,wolfspartan1,the og xbox and 360 were ok
15-02-2018T19:35:26,wolfspartan1,the 360 having a rocky start
15-02-2018T19:35:52,Bgrmystr2,"the 360 was kinda lame honestly. I saw where they wanted to go with it, but srsly, there's nothing 360 about it"
15-02-2018T19:36:02,CrRAR,"Mmm, yeah, I just... don't feel like the One has even any games worth playing."
15-02-2018T19:36:24,CrRAR,I think there's more originality on the PS these days.
15-02-2018T19:36:24,wolfspartan1,i loved the blades dashbored on the 360
15-02-2018T19:36:32,CrRAR,Yeahhhh
15-02-2018T19:36:39,wolfspartan1,then they slowly stuffed more ads in our faces
15-02-2018T19:36:53,CrRAR,*swish**swish**swish*
15-02-2018T19:36:58,CrRAR,*swish**swish*
15-02-2018T19:37:05,Bgrmystr2,"lol Cr, you mean swish swish stab"
15-02-2018T19:37:17,CrRAR,XD
15-02-2018T19:38:00,wolfspartan1,i'm sad the og xbox live is gone
15-02-2018T19:38:41,Bgrmystr2,yeh
15-02-2018T19:38:52,CrRAR,I feel like Msft just... overdoes everything these days.
15-02-2018T19:39:08,CrRAR,Overdos it ded
15-02-2018T19:39:41,wolfspartan1,if it makes them money they don't care
15-02-2018T19:40:53,CrRAR,They sit in their development room and go:
15-02-2018T19:40:56,CrRAR,"""Okay, it's perfect! ...now let's fcuk it up!"""
15-02-2018T19:41:09,Bgrmystr2,lol
15-02-2018T19:41:14,Bgrmystr2,they know full well what they're doing
15-02-2018T19:41:26,wolfspartan1,sounds like bungie
15-02-2018T19:41:32,CrRAR,Yeahhhhh :'(
15-02-2018T19:41:44,Bgrmystr2,"""What will make us the most money from all the stupids while simultaniously costing the least amount of money and effort from us?"
15-02-2018T19:41:53,Bgrmystr2,- Microsoft devs
15-02-2018T19:42:36,CrRAR,"Poor Bungie... I just don't get why they keep letting themselves get bought... Getting away from Msft was their ""Master Plan"""
15-02-2018T19:43:03,wolfspartan1,didn't they want to go it alone?
15-02-2018T19:43:05,Bgrmystr2,considering what MS did with Halo after Bungie left
15-02-2018T19:43:19,wolfspartan1,just to get bought out
15-02-2018T19:43:21,CrRAR,...next step though ... waa get bought by Activision.
15-02-2018T19:43:22,Bgrmystr2,"Bungie was done with halo, honestly. After they left, they considered the story finished."
15-02-2018T19:43:29,CrRAR,Yeah
15-02-2018T19:43:32,Bgrmystr2,they wanted to move onto the next story
15-02-2018T19:43:35,Bgrmystr2,and so they did
15-02-2018T19:43:42,Bgrmystr2,but microsoft just stepped on everything they left behind
15-02-2018T19:43:44,wolfspartan1,halo 3 should have been the end
15-02-2018T19:43:47,Bgrmystr2,and continued halo cuz money
15-02-2018T19:44:15,CrRAR,The way they're monetizing Destiny drove Jason Jones out. The first Destiny cut sooooo much story.
15-02-2018T19:44:23,wolfspartan1,like halo 3 wrapped up the story beautifully
15-02-2018T19:44:47,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, Bungie did the Halos so well"
15-02-2018T19:44:58,wolfspartan1,then poor donny
15-02-2018T19:45:06,CrRAR,Yeah
15-02-2018T19:45:22,TheBeckoner,Probably gonna miss the stream.
15-02-2018T19:45:25,wolfspartan1,i'm glad he won the case
15-02-2018T19:45:59,CrRAR,There's still some original folks left but yeah the soul of the place kinda moved out.
15-02-2018T19:46:09,CrRAR,Aww Beck
15-02-2018T19:46:23,CrRAR,It happenz
15-02-2018T19:47:56,wolfspartan1,old bungie is dead
15-02-2018T19:48:55,wolfspartan1,"it was funny people were hyped over destiny 2 and i was thinking ""it's going to be the same disappointment as the first one"""
15-02-2018T19:56:47,CrRAR,"Yeah, when I saw bungie release the plan for it before Destiny 1... you could tell the tables had turned."
15-02-2018T19:57:37,CrRAR,"They were like ""game now, and it 2018 and another later! AND a bazillion DLCs!!!"""

15-02-2018T20:14:57,qwe304,sure...
15-02-2018T20:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ok, so you know Walmart will write something on any cake you pick out on our display right?"
15-02-2018T20:16:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well Wednesday, a woman picked out a cake, got I believe happy birthday written on it, and picked it up after her other shopping and left"
15-02-2018T20:17:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"That was our cake decorator’s last thing, so she cleaned up and went home"
15-02-2018T20:18:04,Questionbox2018,:zipper_mouth:

15-02-2018T20:20:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"We say she’s not, and the lady explains that’s too bad because despite having received the clear topped finished cake ten minutes ago, she has discovered a problem. Guess. What."
15-02-2018T20:20:36,CrRAR,Dropped eeeet?
15-02-2018T20:20:47,SpazztasticKiwi,“There’s too many sprinkles on the cake” she says
15-02-2018T20:20:55,CrRAR,Oh lord
15-02-2018T20:21:15,qwe304,use a vacuum
15-02-2018T20:21:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t think a soul at work likes that woman
15-02-2018T20:21:46,CrRAR,Probably wanted a discount or free cake :|
15-02-2018T20:22:00,CrRAR,Crazy
15-02-2018T20:22:21,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s exactly it - she makes complaints all the time and always asks if this or that can be discounted more
15-02-2018T20:24:15,Questionbox2018,@bespin

15-02-2018T20:25:58,qwe304,i fell bad that you have to work at walmart
15-02-2018T20:26:35,Bgrmystr2,"lol. People say the customer is always right.. but if that were true, they wouldn't be coming to YOU for YOUR expertise on what they're there for, now would they?"
15-02-2018T20:26:39,Bgrmystr2,Customer is not always right.
15-02-2018T20:26:53,CrRAR,Mmm
15-02-2018T20:26:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I actually really really like it there - it’s the people (certain people in particular) that I’m not always crazy for
15-02-2018T20:28:23,CrRAR,I could see it being kind of interesting working in a warehouse setting haha
15-02-2018T20:28:27,CrRAR,so much space to cover
15-02-2018T20:28:40,CrRAR,Very spacy

15-02-2018T21:28:05,Nekonny,Tom you have a team to handle sugestions?
15-02-2018T21:28:10,ZRO4825,Well at least they'll be in triplicate
15-02-2018T21:28:11,Twokinds,Yes
15-02-2018T21:28:13,Twokinds,Me myself and I
15-02-2018T21:28:16,Nekonny,XD
15-02-2018T21:28:21,CrRAR,hahaha
15-02-2018T21:28:23,Twokinds,I actually don't know what a movie breakroom looks like
15-02-2018T21:28:35,qwe304,google?
15-02-2018T21:28:37,CrRAR,This looks pretty accurate
15-02-2018T21:28:43,MetalAppleSauce,to google!
15-02-2018T21:28:53,CrRAR,"Lots of epty space misplaced props, set pices and snacks"
15-02-2018T21:29:04,CrRAR,*pieces
15-02-2018T21:29:07,Ordithus,AAA production or B flick?
15-02-2018T21:29:19,qwe304,"like a mix between the off-set part of a movie set, and a normal break room"
15-02-2018T21:29:24,InTheLionsDen,Temporary tables set up between trailers.
15-02-2018T21:29:25,Kagiyama89,a very very very bad airport lounge..
15-02-2018T21:29:27,MrEase,maybe they're outside in between a bunch of trailers (like not film trailers but vehicle trailers)
15-02-2018T21:29:33,MetalAppleSauce,Just add a couple dozen coffe machines and mabye a cola dispenser
15-02-2018T21:29:39,ZRO4825,"One day I aim to make a movie so bad, it gets classified as a C-movie."

15-02-2018T21:29:54,Twokinds,Darn it
15-02-2018T21:30:13,CrRAR,Don't forget a camera orphaned by the crew!
15-02-2018T21:30:14,Twokinds,Searching movie break room got me a movie called breakroom. Searching movie trailers gets me movie trailers
15-02-2018T21:30:19,Twokinds,Darn words with multi meanings
15-02-2018T21:30:20,CrRAR,wow

15-02-2018T21:30:52,BluePhantom90,um how about voice cast break room?
15-02-2018T21:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s your world - it can have anything you want in it
15-02-2018T21:31:44,MetalAppleSauce,Shh. It's supposed to be NOT the tk world :P
15-02-2018T21:31:45,Bespin,Hey Tom I made a poll concerning something that I think would benefit the Twokinds community a ton and I was wondering if I could post it here to see how people would react
15-02-2018T21:31:55,Twokinds,I like the idea of having them outside on a movie lot
15-02-2018T21:31:56,Bespin,;thinking:

15-02-2018T21:32:29,SpazztasticKiwi,basically an RV
15-02-2018T21:32:32,MetalAppleSauce,Tour bus
15-02-2018T21:32:32,CrRAR,White box
15-02-2018T21:32:34,ZRO4825,Most trailers look like boxes on wheels that everyone on the highway does their best to avoid being anywhere near but still take forever to pass when they're in the only other lane to pass it.

15-02-2018T21:33:27,MetalAppleSauce,^ that too
15-02-2018T21:33:38,Bgrmystr2,"It gave me a few images, but I'm not really sure what exactly you're looking for"
15-02-2018T21:34:03,MetalAppleSauce,He's looking for the place that the actors hang out when they aren't on set for a show/movie
15-02-2018T21:34:24,MetalAppleSauce,I haven't seen one myself but I think it's relatively the same thing as a backstage for musicians
15-02-2018T21:35:05,MatyMaty,welp time to head home

15-02-2018T21:36:00,Twokinds,I literally can't find a picture of one so I guess I just won't do the background tonight
15-02-2018T21:36:44,Dimensional,"A break room would be a place with a semi-comfortabe sofa, a small TV, the walls would be covered in some cloth and various other things to dampen sound, as to avoid any sound from in there to affect shooting near by."
15-02-2018T21:37:05,Whitestripes,Hello
15-02-2018T21:37:05,Dimensional,"Might include a fridge, unless there is intense makeup that takes forever to put on and is delicate"
15-02-2018T21:37:25,Bgrmystr2,"Dimen, I think you're fusing a ""break room"" with a ""dressing room"""
15-02-2018T21:37:37,Dimensional,A little bit.
15-02-2018T21:37:40,Ordithus,"Coffee and donuts, that's for sure."
15-02-2018T21:37:40,MetalAppleSauce,"when in doubt, just have a scene from the comic in the background as if it was being filmed right then"
15-02-2018T21:37:46,Dimensional,But mostly described a break room.
15-02-2018T21:38:47,Bgrmystr2,unlikely to find makeup stuff there.
15-02-2018T21:39:03,Bgrmystr2,It's likely no different than a break room you see in offices
15-02-2018T21:39:22,Bgrmystr2,"foodstuff, tables, couches, tv, etc."
15-02-2018T21:39:22,Dimensional,"nods. ""Hence the semi-comfortable sofa."
15-02-2018T21:39:30,UnknownEnd,Wow
15-02-2018T21:39:32,Bgrmystr2,dunno why it would need sound dampening
15-02-2018T21:39:54,Dimensional,Because they are filming? The break room has to be in shouting distance of the set? Pun intended.
15-02-2018T21:39:58,Bgrmystr2,"the room they would be filming in would be the room that needs dampening,"
15-02-2018T21:40:04,Ordithus,So when Laura cusses like a sailor the mics don't pick it up
15-02-2018T21:40:15,Combak,Quad stream!
15-02-2018T21:40:22,Dimensional,So the break room would need something ot keep any loud noices in the break room from being heard outside.
15-02-2018T21:40:23,MetalAppleSauce,Laura's not the one that would do that
15-02-2018T21:40:28,MetalAppleSauce,Evals is
15-02-2018T21:40:30,Bgrmystr2,why would it be though Dimen? A good building takes account for that.
15-02-2018T21:40:34,Combak,So is that a Nora Card Tom?
15-02-2018T21:40:43,Dimensional,A good building takes account of that by having the sound dampening.
15-02-2018T21:40:45,MetalAppleSauce,"""I don't know"" Combak"
15-02-2018T21:41:04,CrRAR,The magic 8-ball says: Possibly!
15-02-2018T21:41:14,Bgrmystr2,The sound dampening doesn't need to be in the break room if it's already going to be in the room they're recording.
15-02-2018T21:41:32,Bgrmystr2,I think you're missing the point of the sound dampening
15-02-2018T21:41:43,Ordithus,Studio stages have plenty of sound dampening to prevent echos
15-02-2018T21:41:51,Bgrmystr2,exactly ^
15-02-2018T21:42:00,Bgrmystr2,they don't record in the break room
15-02-2018T21:42:07,Ordithus,Not usually
15-02-2018T21:42:16,qwe304,"https://ak1.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/22675291/thumb/1.jpg - just have a bunch of cameras and scaffolding, then have a folding table with food and drinks, people will get the point"
15-02-2018T21:42:18,Ordithus,SNL and Conan do
15-02-2018T21:42:39,Bgrmystr2,aaaand it's gone
15-02-2018T21:42:48,Ordithus,It was a studio scene
15-02-2018T21:42:50,MetalAppleSauce,"I mean, I see why he put it there"
15-02-2018T21:43:05,CrRAR,"Sometimes they'll record for like a documentary of the making of but yeah not for the feature production, durrr"

15-02-2018T21:43:32,Dimensional,The sound dampening doesn't mean they have foam on the walls. Could just be some fabric.
