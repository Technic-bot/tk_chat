14-08-2018T00:03:03,SageSaga,just heard from Tom
14-08-2018T00:06:51,TheBeckoner,What'd he say?
14-08-2018T00:07:07,SageSaga,His powers been out all day
14-08-2018T00:07:16,SageSaga,and its still not exactly fixed- its weird
14-08-2018T00:07:25,TheBeckoner,Ah makes sense
14-08-2018T00:07:40,TheBeckoner,Doe she have a generator or anything?
14-08-2018T00:07:45,TheBeckoner,does he*
14-08-2018T00:07:59,TheBeckoner,Im guessing no
14-08-2018T00:08:59,SageSaga,nope
14-08-2018T00:09:17,Twokinds,I'm not dead!
14-08-2018T00:09:24,TheBeckoner,heyo
14-08-2018T00:09:26,SageSaga,:P
14-08-2018T00:09:41,TheBeckoner,Power's back?
14-08-2018T00:09:55,Twokinds,...sorta
14-08-2018T00:09:59,Twokinds,Half my house has power now
14-08-2018T00:10:07,TheBeckoner,Huh
14-08-2018T00:10:13,Twokinds,Hoping they add the other half soon
14-08-2018T00:10:23,TheBeckoner,do you have like two breaker boxes or something?
14-08-2018T00:10:35,TheBeckoner,Does the AC half work?
14-08-2018T00:10:39,SageSaga,it makes no sense! and I took 2 years of electric engineering
14-08-2018T00:10:56,TheBeckoner,That is really bizarre
14-08-2018T00:11:06,TheBeckoner,I cant really see how that could happen
14-08-2018T00:11:11,TheBeckoner,but I guess it has
14-08-2018T00:15:16,TorqueEmUp,I mean I assume the breaker box has been checked to make sure nothing tripped?
14-08-2018T00:16:19,TorqueEmUp,If a surge happened it could have tripped some of the breakers.
14-08-2018T00:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,What kind of sense does that make?
14-08-2018T00:20:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Was it ‚Äúflicker flicker, dead‚Äù, or ‚Äúboom - no juice‚Äù"
14-08-2018T00:21:10,Twokinds,It was a tree
14-08-2018T00:21:15,TorqueEmUp,Still doesn't meak breakers can't be tripped.
14-08-2018T00:21:39,TorqueEmUp,That's the only thing that'd make sence. There is only 1 source of electricity going into your home. Not two.
14-08-2018T00:21:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Mother Nature says get off the computer
14-08-2018T00:22:40,TorqueEmUp,Unless your house used to be a duplex
14-08-2018T00:23:44,Twokinds,"Obviously, the breakers are the first thing I checked."
14-08-2018T00:24:11,Twokinds,"If they're damaged, that's not something I can fix myself."
14-08-2018T00:25:26,TorqueEmUp,"Weird, that doesn't make much sense then."
14-08-2018T00:26:31,TorqueEmUp,Some screwy electrical work some previous owner did or something.
14-08-2018T00:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Time for fix it man to visit? üîß
14-08-2018T00:30:51,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a right mess..
14-08-2018T00:31:23,TorqueEmUp,But even shoddy electrical work doesn't even explain it.
14-08-2018T00:31:50,Bgrmystr2,I gues it highly depends on what the tree fell on for it to have cut half the power of the house
14-08-2018T00:32:12,Mippy,:ptv-wondering: strangeness
14-08-2018T00:32:21,TorqueEmUp,"But unless he has a house that used to be a duplex, there should be only one power line supplying the house."
14-08-2018T00:32:59,TorqueEmUp,Electricity doesn't work like that. Half the supply doesn't mean half your outlets don't work.
14-08-2018T00:33:13,Bgrmystr2,maybe the tree didn't fall the line going to the house
14-08-2018T00:33:25,Bgrmystr2,fall on*
14-08-2018T00:33:29,TorqueEmUp,*shakes head* you still don't understand.
14-08-2018T00:33:36,Bgrmystr2,Oh I understand
14-08-2018T00:33:51,Bgrmystr2,I just think it's a wiring thing.
14-08-2018T00:34:09,Twokinds,I'm calling an electrician tomorrow
14-08-2018T00:34:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Progress
14-08-2018T00:34:31,Twokinds,The people from the energy company came by and said the house is getting the right voltage
14-08-2018T00:34:35,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps the electricity goes to one half of the house, then goes in a big loop somewhere, then goes to the other half of the house.. and somewhere down the line, that halfway point got severed"
14-08-2018T00:34:55,Twokinds,They checked the breaker and couldn't find anything wrong.
14-08-2018T00:35:09,TorqueEmUp,Not sure how a tree outside would effect the wiring inside the house. lol
14-08-2018T00:35:19,Chippotatothefirst,Is by chance your house old? My house is 105 years old and the cotton wires once rubbed together and shorted out a part of my house that took a couple months to locate
14-08-2018T00:35:35,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps the wiring isn't inside, Torque xD"
14-08-2018T00:35:41,Bgrmystr2,could be underground
14-08-2018T00:35:59,Bgrmystr2,or the vibrations could have shaken something loose
14-08-2018T00:36:08,TorqueEmUp,"Umm no, there aren't multiple lines going into 1 house."
14-08-2018T00:36:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably not gonna have any answers till the call tomorrow
14-08-2018T00:37:01,Bgrmystr2,Of course there isn't Torque. xD
14-08-2018T00:37:32,TorqueEmUp,It'd be a helluva coincidence for a wire to fail at the same time as a power outtage.
14-08-2018T00:37:54,Bgrmystr2,probably not quite a coincidence
14-08-2018T00:38:00,Bgrmystr2,could have been a surge when the power failed
14-08-2018T00:38:03,Bgrmystr2,and fried something
14-08-2018T00:38:08,Chippotatothefirst,Oh
14-08-2018T00:38:41,TorqueEmUp,I dunno what else there'd be between the breaker box and the outlets other than wire. lol
14-08-2018T00:39:36,TorqueEmUp,"I mean some outlets have their own little circuit breakers in them, but you usually just see those in areas around water."
14-08-2018T00:39:48,TorqueEmUp,"Kitchen, Bathroom, Garage"
14-08-2018T00:39:50,Chippotatothefirst,Could a surge have fried a cheep power adapter or something shorting it out from there?
14-08-2018T00:39:59,Bgrmystr2,"could have been one outlet that died, Torque."
14-08-2018T00:40:07,Bgrmystr2,and cut the rest of the outlets afterwards
14-08-2018T00:40:14,Bgrmystr2,that's how my room is wired.
14-08-2018T00:40:14,TorqueEmUp,Then that'd trip the breaker
14-08-2018T00:40:32,TorqueEmUp,if it was shorting out
14-08-2018T00:40:49,Bgrmystr2,"you say that, but my room didn't do that lol"
14-08-2018T00:40:50,Chippotatothefirst,Btw Tom you might want to check any gfi switches that may be daisy chained off of
14-08-2018T00:41:27,TorqueEmUp,"He said he's calling an electrician, so anything we say is pretty moot at this point."
14-08-2018T00:41:44,Bgrmystr2,"my room had fairly shoddy wiring, all the outlets in the room were wired to the power switch.. turn the switch on, the outlets turn on"
14-08-2018T00:41:48,Bgrmystr2,it was retarded as fuck
14-08-2018T00:41:56,Chippotatothefirst,Well true but it‚Äôs a fun guessing game
14-08-2018T00:42:02,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
14-08-2018T00:42:14,TorqueEmUp,"But yeah, i've got outlets like that in my apartment."
14-08-2018T00:42:32,TorqueEmUp,but only the top of the two plugs are attached to the light switch.
14-08-2018T00:42:53,Chippotatothefirst,That‚Äôs how my old apartment was
14-08-2018T00:43:18,Mippy,My place has this strange issue. When we turn off the fan in the bathroom the TV in the living room flicks in and off.
14-08-2018T00:43:34,TorqueEmUp,"Then again, I can barely understand AC power as it is."
14-08-2018T00:43:44,Bgrmystr2,"all three of mine were connected to the light switch. Now they're not, but it was dumb. If the light switch failed, all my outlets would fail too."
14-08-2018T00:44:07,TorqueEmUp,don't understand how two light switches attached to the same outlet begins to work.
14-08-2018T00:44:31,Chippotatothefirst,Me too
14-08-2018T00:44:42,Chippotatothefirst,It‚Äôs just magic
14-08-2018T00:44:43,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-08-2018T00:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Other than this fun curveball, anything going on Tom?"
14-08-2018T00:45:43,Chippotatothefirst,Btw Tom don‚Äôt use your  tongue to test AC power it hurts
14-08-2018T00:46:19,Chippotatothefirst,Jk I‚Äôm not that stupid
14-08-2018T00:46:31,Bgrmystr2,dude that would kill someone
14-08-2018T00:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Who in their right mind thinks that‚Äôs a good idea
14-08-2018T00:47:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Though if you do actually do that I think we can afford to lose you
14-08-2018T00:47:14,Chippotatothefirst,Hah
14-08-2018T00:47:32,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair kiwi, agree"
14-08-2018T00:48:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Weed out the stupid: remove common sense warning labels
14-08-2018T00:48:34,Bgrmystr2,lolo
14-08-2018T00:49:02,TorqueEmUp,Hmm the google machine says....
14-08-2018T00:49:18,Bgrmystr2,"gonna install video drivers, may need to lurk for a bit if it demands I close my browser"
14-08-2018T00:49:23,TorqueEmUp,"""Well usually when ""half"" of something dies in residential electrical, it means one hot leg is down."""
14-08-2018T00:49:54,TorqueEmUp,"""This could be an issue at the transformer, the wiring to your meter, the meter itself, the wiring from the meter to your main panel, the main breaker or a fault within your panel."""
14-08-2018T00:50:08,Chippotatothefirst,?
14-08-2018T00:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Like our cardboard baler has a warning ‚Äúdo not place any part of your body inside machine‚Äù
14-08-2018T00:50:26,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt say?‚Äù
14-08-2018T00:50:59,TorqueEmUp,"So yeah, sounds like electrician work in other words. lol"
14-08-2018T00:51:17,Bgrmystr2,sure does lol
14-08-2018T00:51:41,TorqueEmUp,Well half your power is better than no power at all.
14-08-2018T00:51:48,Chippotatothefirst,True
14-08-2018T00:52:19,Chippotatothefirst,Or the rest just went out and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs not talking
14-08-2018T00:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôd log him out though too
14-08-2018T00:53:48,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
14-08-2018T00:55:11,Chippotatothefirst,I am stuck in guessing game mode
14-08-2018T00:55:17,Twokinds,I have a string of extension cords giving me power and internet from the bathroom with working outlets
14-08-2018T00:55:33,Chippotatothefirst,Sounds safe
14-08-2018T00:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Let‚Äôs play ‚Äútry not to trip in the dark‚Äù
14-08-2018T00:55:53,SpazztasticKiwi,With added challenge: cat
14-08-2018T00:56:28,Twokinds,half the extension cords are hanging from the cat tree
14-08-2018T00:56:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, your bathroom is giving you Internet ?"
14-08-2018T00:56:40,TorqueEmUp,lol
14-08-2018T00:57:12,Bgrmystr2,driver install demands I restart pc. Guess I'm gonna brb. lurkin on the laptop for now
14-08-2018T00:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,üëåüèª
14-08-2018T00:57:57,Chippotatothefirst,You must have  shitty Internet
14-08-2018T00:58:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Ayyyyyy
14-08-2018T00:58:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Really goes down the drain sometimes
14-08-2018T00:59:01,Chippotatothefirst,Ha
14-08-2018T01:02:31,Chippotatothefirst,*conversation does to bathroom jokes*
14-08-2018T01:02:39,Chippotatothefirst,*dies
14-08-2018T01:06:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well I‚Äôd make more, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôd just be like taking a plunger to the conversation"
14-08-2018T01:11:42,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I'm gonna have to wash my hands after reading what just happened. You two are done."
14-08-2018T01:11:56,Bgrmystr2,also +1 to both of you
14-08-2018T01:14:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I wonder if it‚Äôs what I say or how. Some of my puns and jokes land with some but sail right over the others
14-08-2018T01:15:39,Chippotatothefirst,"Same, makes you wonder if it‚Äôs you or them"
14-08-2018T01:17:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve looked someone straight in the eye and wondered ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a special kind of stupid, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù"
14-08-2018T01:17:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well actually multiple people, and that‚Äôs not because they don‚Äôt get a joke. It‚Äôs because what I just experienced with them makes me question my ears"
14-08-2018T01:18:32,Chippotatothefirst,I do that quite often especially in places with tons of mirrors
14-08-2018T01:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess we‚Äôre all also entitled to a few special moments though
14-08-2018T01:20:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And that was a quick restart
14-08-2018T01:22:11,Bgrmystr2,14 minutes? Quick? lol
14-08-2018T01:22:32,TorqueEmUp,Well at least you had extension cords Tom. Would have probably sucked if you didn't. lol
14-08-2018T01:22:42,Chippotatothefirst,I‚Äôve had a computer take two days
14-08-2018T01:23:21,Chippotatothefirst,Given 26-year-old computers don‚Äôt like when you put windows 10 on them
14-08-2018T01:23:39,Bgrmystr2,why would you put a resource hog on an old computer
14-08-2018T01:23:42,Bgrmystr2,seriously?
14-08-2018T01:23:59,Chippotatothefirst,At the request of my nephew
14-08-2018T01:24:45,Bgrmystr2,the fact that it took 2 days to boot means there's a problem to begin with
14-08-2018T01:24:52,TorqueEmUp,"You wouldn't even be able to get the installer to boot, let alone install and run Windows 10 on a early 90s PC. lol"
14-08-2018T01:25:11,Bgrmystr2,"lol early 90s, prolly not"
14-08-2018T01:25:18,Bgrmystr2,but mid/late 90s perhaps
14-08-2018T01:25:25,Bgrmystr2,depends on ram
14-08-2018T01:25:36,Chippotatothefirst,I personally hate windows x
14-08-2018T01:25:41,TorqueEmUp,"Unless you had some server grade stuff, maybe lol"
14-08-2018T01:26:06,Chippotatothefirst,I think the ram was something along the lines of 76 bites
14-08-2018T01:26:15,Bgrmystr2,bytes? lol
14-08-2018T01:26:31,TorqueEmUp,"Nah, even 70s computers had more RAM than that. lol"
14-08-2018T01:26:50,TorqueEmUp,probably Megabytes
14-08-2018T01:27:00,Bgrmystr2,you're probably thinking of 76mb yeah
14-08-2018T01:27:09,Chippotatothefirst,"Nope, let‚Äôs see if I can find it"
14-08-2018T01:27:14,TheBeckoner,lol bytes
14-08-2018T01:27:17,TheBeckoner,I think not
14-08-2018T01:27:20,TorqueEmUp,can't be
14-08-2018T01:27:29,Bgrmystr2,"it's not going to have 76bytes of ram, sorry mate"
14-08-2018T01:27:34,Bgrmystr2,but that's just no
14-08-2018T01:27:44,TorqueEmUp,"76KB, but that be early 80s tech."
14-08-2018T01:27:54,TheBeckoner,like if it was from the 60's maybe

14-08-2018T15:33:28,Twokinds,Power still half out
14-08-2018T15:33:36,Twokinds,Breakers are damaged need replacing
14-08-2018T15:38:10,iliar,Hmm. Breakers rarely break independently. Usually damage to the breakers indicates that something else is broken.
14-08-2018T15:41:24,Twokinds,I don't know much about the stuff
14-08-2018T15:41:30,Twokinds,Just said he'd have to replace some stuff
14-08-2018T15:41:37,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, you have a power cut?"
14-08-2018T15:41:40,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
14-08-2018T15:42:06,Twokinds,Quoted $500 to fix :(
14-08-2018T15:42:16,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds That's hefty.
14-08-2018T15:42:38,CrimsonQuill,I've just realised that I am actually on livechat with my favorite webcomic artist.
14-08-2018T15:42:52,Twokinds,Yeah for just repairing some breakers seems really pricey
14-08-2018T15:43:18,CrimsonQuill,I don't know much abut breaker malfunctions...
14-08-2018T15:43:52,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds What's the weather like where you live? Hot?
14-08-2018T15:45:13,iliar,I work with electricity. So I can say for sure. The problem is rarely solved just by replacing the breakers.
14-08-2018T15:45:35,CrimsonQuill,@ $ iLiar What could break a breaker?
14-08-2018T15:45:39,Twokinds,Well I don't know what else to do.
14-08-2018T15:45:45,Twokinds,I would hope they'd check everything else.
14-08-2018T15:45:57,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Maybe it's something in the wiring.
14-08-2018T15:46:00,Twokinds,They're coming back tomorrow to do the fix
14-08-2018T15:46:09,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Good luck.
14-08-2018T15:51:08,iliar,"Breakers are needed for protection. Sometimes, they break down independently. But usually something else breaks and the breakers save you from even bigger problems like fire."
14-08-2018T15:51:24,CrimsonQuill,@iliar Oh crumbs.
14-08-2018T15:51:57,CrimsonQuill,@iliar That sounds very bad.

14-08-2018T18:11:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like you‚Äôre in for a fun ride
14-08-2018T18:34:43,CrRAR,"Yeah like in a car, a breaker (fuse) trips you know something on that circuit is weird. One time the climate control fuse kept blowing in my bros car and it ended up being the blower motor was rusted out and drawing too much current."
14-08-2018T18:36:24,CrRAR,but yeah just see where the 1st visit gets ya.
14-08-2018T18:40:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It pays to have friends in the technical fields
14-08-2018T18:40:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Cheaper bills
