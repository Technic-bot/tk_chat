27-09-2018T20:15:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
27-09-2018T20:15:52,SageSaga,see that loop alone is better than that head bob boob bounce

27-09-2018T20:18:37,unsteddyphoenix,just give her the crown and make her a princess
27-09-2018T20:18:41,SageSaga,if i was going to draw Bowsette i would have done it a while ago and it would be Bowsette - not a cosplay
27-09-2018T20:18:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats how it works, right?"
27-09-2018T20:18:47,ZRO4825,lol

27-09-2018T20:19:20,unsteddyphoenix,yo daddy
27-09-2018T20:19:23,SageSaga,a few days?
27-09-2018T20:19:48,CrRAR,hey robit
27-09-2018T20:20:27,SageSaga,it started September 19th
27-09-2018T20:20:46,Bgrmystr2,so.. a week and 2 days
27-09-2018T20:21:39,Nekonny,but it's only really taken off in the past few days
27-09-2018T20:21:40,Ordithus,A lifetime in the world of memes
27-09-2018T20:22:02,Bgrmystr2,"it took off immediately, honestly"
27-09-2018T20:22:05,SageSaga,yeah
27-09-2018T20:22:10,Bgrmystr2,it just took it time to get to where you would see it
27-09-2018T20:22:14,FoxxTrotter,Interesting that it would be started on International Talk Like a Pirate Day. :0P
27-09-2018T20:22:26,SageSaga,i saw the original - same day- and saw it explode
27-09-2018T20:22:27,FoxxTrotter,Stealing the social scene.
27-09-2018T20:22:34,Nekonny,"and it;'s not like that kept people from drawing the cat bob window, or the cutoff sweater, or the shark swimsuit, or a boatload of other meme drawings"
27-09-2018T20:23:06,SageSaga,what are you even talking about now?
27-09-2018T20:23:18,unsteddyphoenix,Is the cutoff sweater the VK sweater?
27-09-2018T20:23:23,unsteddyphoenix,Idk the other ones
27-09-2018T20:23:41,Nekonny,what I'm saying is you don't have to draw it as soon as it becomes a thing
27-09-2018T20:23:45,Nekonny,draw what you like
27-09-2018T20:23:51,Nekonny,or are commissioned to
27-09-2018T20:24:09,SageSaga,i havent been  commissioned to do it- and I would have drawn it already if i planned to
27-09-2018T20:24:31,unsteddyphoenix,Zro wheres your bowsette request smh
27-09-2018T20:24:42,Mippy,VK sweater? You mean that ugly thing that defeats the purpose of a sweater?
27-09-2018T20:24:43,Nekonny,alright
27-09-2018T20:24:47,Bgrmystr2,ikr zro

27-09-2018T20:25:35,unsteddyphoenix,Really dropped the ball on this one
27-09-2018T20:26:19,Bgrmystr2,I would say I'm surprised sage hasn't drawn it cuz he wanted to but.. no actually
27-09-2018T20:26:21,Bgrmystr2,I'm not surprised.
27-09-2018T20:26:35,ZRO4825,Bowsette was not a thing when I put in my request for this month!
27-09-2018T20:26:45,Bgrmystr2,Someone predicted it though!
27-09-2018T20:26:48,Ordithus,It could have been your Meme!
27-09-2018T20:26:50,unsteddyphoenix,Thats NO excuse
27-09-2018T20:26:59,ZRO4825,I went Touhou at someone's suggestion! >:V
27-09-2018T20:27:18,SageSaga,did i say I wanted to draw it?
27-09-2018T20:27:41,Bgrmystr2,"and it was amazing, zro :v"
27-09-2018T20:27:47,unsteddyphoenix,Just because it doesnt exist doesnt mean you shouldnt suggest it!
27-09-2018T20:27:47,Nekonny,I have an idea as to why...
27-09-2018T20:28:03,Bgrmystr2,"so basically zro, bowzette next month? :V"
27-09-2018T20:28:19,Bgrmystr2,Monday is next month!
27-09-2018T20:29:13,Ordithus,Has Sage ever rejected a request before? :thinking:
27-09-2018T20:29:20,ZRO4825,Yes.
27-09-2018T20:29:30,ZRO4825,I have requested nekkid Toyoko so many times. ;_;
27-09-2018T20:29:38,CrRAR,"aww yeah, dat fragbox"
27-09-2018T20:29:38,Ordithus,"Well, that answers that haha"
27-09-2018T20:29:42,SageSaga,no you havent
27-09-2018T20:29:46,ZRO4825,SHHHHH!!!!
27-09-2018T20:31:13,Bgrmystr2,"XD you would reject it even if he had, sage"
27-09-2018T20:31:21,ZRO4825,"gonna have to start phrasing my requests as ""Nekkid Toyoko. If not, then do this instead."" :P"
27-09-2018T20:31:29,Bgrmystr2,haha
27-09-2018T20:31:50,Bgrmystr2,"""One of these days.. it'll happen"" - zro probably"
27-09-2018T20:31:55,Ordithus,You didn't specify no convenient censorship
27-09-2018T20:32:08,SageSaga,there are some characters with restrictions that I have refused
27-09-2018T20:32:08,ZRO4825,"To be fair, I've kinda already got it with censorship once!"
27-09-2018T20:32:25,SageSaga,people can Request Mihari pictures but they have to be ran by Mihari first
27-09-2018T20:32:35,ZRO4825,I haz an idea this year that will be....not quite so cake covered. :3
27-09-2018T20:33:10,ZRO4825,"I mean, it'll still have cake. November is birthday month after all, gotta have cake. Or at least presents."
27-09-2018T20:33:12,Nekonny,Wonder if I could cameo this spot
27-09-2018T20:33:29,Nekonny,pobot girl
27-09-2018T20:33:34,Nekonny,*robot
27-09-2018T20:35:41,CrRAR,"domo arigato, Ms. Poboto"

27-09-2018T20:36:25,Mippy,Who is the bouncing cat girl? He boobs are kind of mesmerizing
27-09-2018T20:36:32,Mihari,Which she doing a chicken peck?
27-09-2018T20:36:36,Mihari,Why*

27-09-2018T20:37:06,CommanderTrace,hello there
27-09-2018T20:37:09,Nekonny,hum
27-09-2018T20:37:19,Nekonny,let me see here
27-09-2018T20:37:21,Bgrmystr2,it.. doesn't look like it changed
27-09-2018T20:37:25,Bgrmystr2,but I only saw it once so
27-09-2018T20:37:26,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-09-2018T20:37:32,Nekonny,file may not have updated
27-09-2018T20:37:33,Mihari,The head doesn't need to move if you just want boobs to bounce ya know?
27-09-2018T20:37:42,SageSaga,and Mippy- the catgirl is Catgirl Phil
27-09-2018T20:37:57,Mippy,Thanks Sage!
27-09-2018T20:39:47,Nekonny,hum
27-09-2018T20:39:53,Nekonny,can't find the oter anim
27-09-2018T20:40:03,Nekonny,"meh,"
27-09-2018T20:42:02,Nekonny,hows this?
27-09-2018T20:42:27,Mippy,I knew there was some I liked about cat girl Phil (other than the bounce). I quite like Phil as a character. Reminds me of a 2000’s harem anime protagonist (unfortunately I’m still in 2005)
27-09-2018T20:43:44,SageSaga,well it did start in 2003/4
27-09-2018T20:44:04,Mippy,Makes sense XD
27-09-2018T20:45:19,Nekonny,"Ok, hows that?"
27-09-2018T20:45:43,Mihari,"I'm curious, why can't you just have her go up and down?"
27-09-2018T20:45:53,Mihari,No forward or backward leaning required?
27-09-2018T20:46:29,Nekonny,I just haven't had the time to make a lot of custom animations yet
27-09-2018T20:46:45,Nekonny,I only got finished with the layer deformations
27-09-2018T20:46:57,raconis,I think she bounces smoother now Nekonny
27-09-2018T20:47:26,Nekonny,Obviously she can't compare in smothness to frame by frame animation
27-09-2018T20:47:43,Mippy,I can’t tell. I can only see what Sage is doing at the moment because mobile
27-09-2018T20:47:47,Nekonny,but shes got versatility.
27-09-2018T20:48:02,raconis,"Given the limited time you've worked on her, it looks great"
27-09-2018T20:49:02,Nekonny,thanks ^^
27-09-2018T20:49:15,Nekonny,"Anyway, back to finding a robot girl to cameo"
27-09-2018T20:49:26,Ordithus,robutt
27-09-2018T20:49:36,Nekonny,XD
27-09-2018T20:50:10,raconis,but it's a very nice robutt.
27-09-2018T20:50:40,Dadrobit,Back.
27-09-2018T20:50:41,SageSaga,Ron- None of my girls please
27-09-2018T20:50:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb dad
27-09-2018T20:51:36,Dadrobit,Lady doing the bobbing looks like she's in a manual tranny car with a 15 year old who doesn't quite get the concept of the clutch pedal.
27-09-2018T20:51:46,ZRO4825,XD
27-09-2018T20:51:51,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
27-09-2018T20:52:03,Ordithus,Not terrified enough
27-09-2018T20:52:07,Ordithus,But close
27-09-2018T20:52:13,Nekonny,"Oh, no worries sage, I figured you didn't want them"
27-09-2018T20:52:30,Nekonny,wouldn't have fit too well
27-09-2018T20:52:35,Dadrobit,"Through a forced grin. ""You're... Doing... Great... Keep... Trying...."""
27-09-2018T20:54:42,SageSaga,hmmm
27-09-2018T20:54:48,SageSaga,i dont know if i like this sketch at all
27-09-2018T20:55:13,ZRO4825,I do. Seems very Blue-esque to me.
27-09-2018T20:55:15,raconis,It's looking smooth Sage
27-09-2018T20:55:31,SageSaga,its very boring
27-09-2018T20:55:41,Nekonny,the hand?
27-09-2018T20:55:52,Nekonny,the boobs?
27-09-2018T20:55:55,SageSaga,the hand is too small- but overall the whole picture is boring
27-09-2018T20:55:58,Nekonny,the tail?
27-09-2018T20:56:05,Mastergodai,o/
27-09-2018T20:56:12,SageSaga,Yo Godai
27-09-2018T20:56:16,Bgrmystr2,hey Godai
27-09-2018T20:56:21,raconis,She could be posing? Showing off her new outfit.
27-09-2018T20:56:25,Ordithus,Add explosions.  They make things more exciting.
27-09-2018T20:56:36,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Godai."
27-09-2018T20:56:42,Mihari,The problem is it's too two dimensional
27-09-2018T20:56:48,SageSaga,yeah
27-09-2018T20:56:52,Mippy,Hollywood lives by that Ord
27-09-2018T20:56:57,SageSaga,hmm what to do-
27-09-2018T20:57:14,Nekonny,it wasn't a bad pose idea
27-09-2018T20:57:25,SageSaga,standing - very solid pose
27-09-2018T20:57:51,Ordithus,"Here's an idea, have her eating an ice cream cone and taking a... selfie... (shudders)"
27-09-2018T20:59:01,raconis,Throw in a sexy smile and a wink? kinda like a don't you wish you could have some vibe.
27-09-2018T21:00:40,raconis,Loving that booty already Sage.
27-09-2018T21:04:19,Matthew250,Hello!
27-09-2018T21:04:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Mat

27-09-2018T21:07:27,Bgrmystr2,all of those poses are great sage
27-09-2018T21:07:40,Ordithus,I'm liking 3
27-09-2018T21:08:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I like 3 as well
27-09-2018T21:08:09,unsteddyphoenix,"I like 2, but 1 is very tempting~"
27-09-2018T21:08:12,ZRO4825,I like 2 ^_^
27-09-2018T21:08:46,raconis,"Yeah 2 is sexy, but 1 is smooth."
27-09-2018T21:13:21,Ordithus,"Huh, a bit of a simlarity in Blue's pose and Robutt girl's pose"
27-09-2018T21:13:26,Ordithus,Looking over the shoulder
27-09-2018T21:14:49,SageSaga,cept Blue's back isnt broken

27-09-2018T21:18:30,Bgrmystr2,"whatever you did, that was fuckin cool"
27-09-2018T21:18:34,Mippy,Spiral Grath?
27-09-2018T21:19:03,SageSaga,XD it's just a Symmetry ruler - its great for doing patterns
27-09-2018T21:19:07,raconis,it was cool yet unsettaling
27-09-2018T21:26:00,Mippy,The butt is strong tonight
27-09-2018T21:26:19,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c4:
27-09-2018T21:26:25,SageSaga,I dont see Tom on atm
27-09-2018T21:26:49,unsteddyphoenix,I hear he's in Korea!
27-09-2018T21:27:03,SageSaga,they have internet in Korea
27-09-2018T21:27:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He's coming back on the 5th right?
27-09-2018T21:27:08,SageSaga,i talked to him the other day
27-09-2018T21:27:28,SageSaga,i think his flight is on the 3rd
27-09-2018T21:27:41,SageSaga,but i bet he wants a day or two to get back to normal
27-09-2018T21:27:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Makes sense
27-09-2018T21:28:04,Mippy,That's understandble.
27-09-2018T21:28:06,Ordithus,"""updates in two weeks, on oct 5th"""
27-09-2018T21:28:24,raconis,Can't wait.
27-09-2018T21:30:21,SageSaga,i'll check in on him around 6am
27-09-2018T21:32:34,SageSaga,huh- i guess if i ever go on that trip to Japan im not gonna have to change my schedule much at all
27-09-2018T21:33:05,unsteddyphoenix,Lol you have a perfect japan sleep schedule?
27-09-2018T21:33:12,Ordithus,:ptv-snicker:
27-09-2018T21:33:22,unsteddyphoenix,The true weeb lives in japan while in another country
27-09-2018T21:33:25,SageSaga,well i go to sleep between 6am and 8am
27-09-2018T21:33:52,SageSaga,so in japan that would be going to bed at 7-9pm
27-09-2018T21:34:07,Nekonny,the jet lag isn't so bag going over there
27-09-2018T21:34:08,unsteddyphoenix,how functional!
27-09-2018T21:34:11,Nekonny,to kore a that is
27-09-2018T21:38:52,SageSaga,wow the AI chapter is almost done
27-09-2018T21:39:15,ZRO4825,Only 3 years till next main cast character! \'.'/
27-09-2018T21:39:25,ZRO4825,I kid~ <3
27-09-2018T21:39:34,SageSaga,far less than that
27-09-2018T21:39:51,ZRO4825,"Fun note: According to my facebook share memory things, just a little over a year ago we got to see drunk Kaylin trolling Jack."
27-09-2018T21:53:26,raconis,missed a hair bit on the right Nekonny
27-09-2018T21:53:32,Nekonny,hum?
27-09-2018T21:53:42,Ordithus,"This talk between Kaylin and Mike has been interesting.  I suppose with how his space/futuristic gear has been handled, he's probably ""stronger"" than Kaylin in this world?"
27-09-2018T21:53:50,Nekonny,"ah, thanks ^^"
27-09-2018T21:54:13,raconis,Np
27-09-2018T21:54:49,SageSaga,Mike is Physically stronger than Kaylin in the world - Mike can pick up his ship and carry it around so long as the ground isnt too soft :P
27-09-2018T21:55:08,raconis,"Just because Mike has the cooler toy, it doesn't mean any of his skills or abilitys will work in that enviroment Ord."
27-09-2018T21:55:17,Ordithus,"That's the opposite of how it's supposed to work, lol"
27-09-2018T21:55:34,raconis,But what do I know of his stat specs
27-09-2018T21:55:39,Ordithus,"In gameworld, you drive spaceship"
27-09-2018T21:55:47,raconis,lol
27-09-2018T21:56:01,SageSaga,that is just his scout ship - not his main ship
27-09-2018T21:56:14,Ordithus,:ptv-confused:
27-09-2018T21:56:41,raconis,"I love to watch Kaylin in distress. I'd love to see her out of 'dis dress as well, lol."
27-09-2018T21:56:48,Ordithus,Good point on the skills and abilities
27-09-2018T21:58:05,SageSaga,Kaylin has  yet to use any of her abilities- she's relied on her skills and stats as well as basic combat maneuvers- but none of her abilities
27-09-2018T21:58:27,unsteddyphoenix,you think shes OP NOW
27-09-2018T21:58:59,raconis,"lol, yeah, now watch her unleash her true power, lol"
27-09-2018T21:59:22,SageSaga,she's only OP compared to most of the Humans you have met so far and of course shes stronger than low level monsters
27-09-2018T21:59:56,Ordithus,"These humans have all been NPCs, so, yeah"
27-09-2018T22:00:01,raconis,don't forget her left leg in the bottom panel Nekonny
27-09-2018T22:00:08,SageSaga,there are powerful NPCs
27-09-2018T22:00:57,Ordithus,Hmm... probably important people
27-09-2018T22:01:14,Ordithus,Can't have that low level character off the king or something like that
27-09-2018T22:01:49,raconis,"well that's tobe expected. The ""Town guards"" in most MMO's are way more powerful than the average PC"
27-09-2018T22:03:00,SageSaga,you think the town guard are the same as those from back when Adventurers were around?
27-09-2018T22:03:04,raconis,I used to play WoW and those average guards were able to deal with poorly planned raids.
27-09-2018T22:03:22,raconis,"No, but who knows what their decendants developed."
27-09-2018T22:03:52,SageSaga,Jack is the captain of the guard...
27-09-2018T22:04:07,Ordithus,"If the ""Adventurers"" aren't around, they probably don't need to be so strong.  No more hijinks :P"
27-09-2018T22:04:10,raconis,The training to be a kings guards probbably haven't deteriorated that much.
27-09-2018T22:05:32,raconis,The reason the guards develop strength is to reinforce the twons. Without the helpful PC's their job would only get harder. unless the avrage level of the monsters also dropped during the 300 year break.
27-09-2018T22:05:39,superwolfart,hi
27-09-2018T22:05:59,SageSaga,yo
27-09-2018T22:06:00,Ordithus,But no more adventurers kiting high level raid bosses to little towns
27-09-2018T22:07:01,raconis,"True, and most of the twons don't tend to be magnets for high level anythings. more like the training areas for beginners."
27-09-2018T22:07:09,raconis,^towns
27-09-2018T22:07:57,raconis,"so it's expected that Jack is not that powerful, but I think he'd be able to tank most of the guards in single combat."
27-09-2018T22:10:53,Ordithus,"Anyways, woe be to he who winds up on the business end of Mike's blaster :fire:"
27-09-2018T22:10:54,Nekonny,"I have to get going, got a lot done though!"
27-09-2018T22:11:07,FoxxTrotter,"Thanks for the stream, Neko."
27-09-2018T22:11:07,raconis,Thanks for the show Nekonny!
27-09-2018T22:11:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the stream Ron o/

27-09-2018T23:20:58,Bgrmystr2,wooow
27-09-2018T23:21:00,Mihari,Oh you will huh?
27-09-2018T23:21:01,SageSaga,24th
27-09-2018T23:21:28,ZRO4825,The 24th is a great day of November.
27-09-2018T23:22:31,ZRO4825,"I will do my best, Mihari. :3"
27-09-2018T23:22:38,ZRO4825,I make no guarantees.
27-09-2018T23:22:49,ZRO4825,I am SLIGHTLY prone to forgetfulness at times...
27-09-2018T23:23:05,Mihari,"I'm just saying, no wise to make open promises like that. :P"
27-09-2018T23:23:26,Ordithus,Will bgr even remember
27-09-2018T23:23:32,SageSaga,So Relm and Toyoko- i might not be able to do the ribbons things
27-09-2018T23:23:35,ZRO4825,Can't help it. Bgr is friend. I make crazy promises to my friends on the basis that they understand I'm a flawed individual. =D
27-09-2018T23:23:39,SageSaga,tried that before- it seems too lewd
27-09-2018T23:23:41,ZRO4825,....no ribbons strong enough?
27-09-2018T23:23:44,ZRO4825,Or that.
27-09-2018T23:23:49,ZRO4825,:thinking:
27-09-2018T23:23:59,ZRO4825,I didn't wanna do the cake thing again. :joy:
27-09-2018T23:24:04,ZRO4825,Ribbons seemed like next best thing.
27-09-2018T23:24:09,unsteddyphoenix,Just get like...a LOT of ribbons
27-09-2018T23:24:13,Ordithus,Isn't your Patreon 18+ anyways
27-09-2018T23:24:18,ZRO4825,Not by choice.
27-09-2018T23:24:21,SageSaga,T_T
27-09-2018T23:24:28,ZRO4825,They ever get back to you yet?
27-09-2018T23:24:31,unsteddyphoenix,But now that it's happened...
27-09-2018T23:24:35,SageSaga,its not 18+ nothing on there is 18+
27-09-2018T23:24:43,SageSaga,just some stuff isnt ok for 6 year olds
27-09-2018T23:24:43,ZRO4825,PG-13 at best I'd say.
27-09-2018T23:24:56,SageSaga,and since a 6 year old cant look at it- it's 18+
27-09-2018T23:25:11,SageSaga,it's dumb
27-09-2018T23:25:13,Ordithus,I don't think a 6 year old would find it anything other than funny
27-09-2018T23:25:21,Ordithus,"""Hehe boobs... butts lol"""
27-09-2018T23:25:38,SageSaga,WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN!
27-09-2018T23:25:51,Ordithus,Okay Maude
27-09-2018T23:25:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so we can feed them to cthulhu later
27-09-2018T23:26:10,Mihari,"Eh, was gonna link ribbons but the mood has shifted. T_T"
27-09-2018T23:26:10,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch ord
27-09-2018T23:26:17,ZRO4825,I like ribbons. =D
27-09-2018T23:26:31,Bgrmystr2,so.. soft no on the ribbons? :ptv-sad:
27-09-2018T23:28:22,Mihari,"Darn, 2 more years before my birthday is on a stream day XD"
27-09-2018T23:28:39,Mihari,"Course, they'll all be at a con most likely again XD"
27-09-2018T23:29:05,SageSaga,i will draw you stuff while at the con
27-09-2018T23:29:16,Mihari,XD
27-09-2018T23:29:28,SageSaga,and before the Con your picture will be ready
27-09-2018T23:29:36,Bgrmystr2,"ayy, one year after that, my bday will be friday :D"
27-09-2018T23:30:00,Mihari,That's assuming patreon doesn't shoot themselves in the foot completely by then.
27-09-2018T23:30:01,unsteddyphoenix,Y'all really planning ahead
27-09-2018T23:30:20,SageSaga,T_T
27-09-2018T23:30:34,Bgrmystr2,haha yes I totally planned my bday to be on a stream day in 2021..
27-09-2018T23:30:37,Mihari,Just saying based on current trends.
27-09-2018T23:30:41,SageSaga,I hope a Patreon replacement comes up soon so i can use both
27-09-2018T23:30:49,Ordithus,My next bday is on a Sunday
27-09-2018T23:30:51,Mihari,I want a Paypal replacement.
27-09-2018T23:30:51,Ordithus,hmmm
27-09-2018T23:32:11,SageSaga,wish i had the capital to make a Patreon replacement and then I could rake in all the money from people making money
27-09-2018T23:33:09,Dadrobit,:/ Wish I had a patreon viable skillset.
27-09-2018T23:33:49,Mihari,I should become a twitch girl while I can still pull it off! XD
27-09-2018T23:33:52,Mihari,Ha!
27-09-2018T23:34:08,Dadrobit,"""Will read you a personalized pickup line for $5 a month"" probably wouldn't fly w/ Patreon."
27-09-2018T23:34:13,SageSaga,you'd be the first twitch girl i watched
27-09-2018T23:34:19,Mihari,LOL
27-09-2018T23:34:26,unsteddyphoenix,I'd pay $5 for a monthly bedtime story dad
27-09-2018T23:34:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
27-09-2018T23:34:33,Ordithus,haha

27-09-2018T23:34:48,unsteddyphoenix,$$$
27-09-2018T23:35:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,$20 for fanfic reading
27-09-2018T23:35:35,Dadrobit,"Also, no chance in high hell I'm reading a whole story for $5. Sorry. Unless it's like a paragraph long."
27-09-2018T23:35:53,Bgrmystr2,"hey, if what you told me that night was true, then yeah ppl would join a patreon for that xD"
27-09-2018T23:35:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Would you read ""Go the fuck to sleep"" For $5?"
27-09-2018T23:35:57,Mihari,I wouldn't read a paragraph for $5 XD
27-09-2018T23:36:07,Mihari,No
27-09-2018T23:36:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Well it's patreon so, it'd me multiple $5's"
27-09-2018T23:36:15,Dadrobit,"For you, Marv, I'd do it for free."

27-09-2018T23:36:41,Mihari,I'd just let Samuel do it for me.
27-09-2018T23:36:46,Dadrobit,"Also, what did I tell you?"
27-09-2018T23:36:50,unsteddyphoenix,L. Jackson?
27-09-2018T23:36:53,Mihari,Yep
27-09-2018T23:37:02,Dadrobit,(I love that video)
27-09-2018T23:37:03,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah agreed
27-09-2018T23:37:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ssame
27-09-2018T23:37:42,SageSaga,Morgan Freeman reading it is better
27-09-2018T23:37:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I want Keith David to read it ;-;
27-09-2018T23:37:56,Bgrmystr2,"lol dadro, you told me about when you talked on some game or whatever and ppl joined the voice chat just to listen to you speak or whatever"
27-09-2018T23:38:06,Dadrobit,"I dunno, I could be possible to set something up along the lines of ""reading a personalized passage for $5 a month"" but I can't see it paying for itself."
27-09-2018T23:38:09,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall the details
27-09-2018T23:38:40,Dadrobit,"Ah, yeah. But that was fake money in a somewhat saturated market in a game that people barely tolerated playing otherwise."
27-09-2018T23:39:07,Dadrobit,Dust 514
27-09-2018T23:39:12,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, but still"
27-09-2018T23:39:25,unsteddyphoenix,No it has to be a general reading so you can charge multiple people for the same recording
27-09-2018T23:39:36,Bgrmystr2,haha
27-09-2018T23:39:46,Ordithus,Narrate your favorite public domain works
27-09-2018T23:39:53,Mihari,$150 - Pick the outfit I stream in each stream!  (Like a boss)
27-09-2018T23:39:55,Dadrobit,Can't unless it's public domain.
27-09-2018T23:39:59,Dadrobit,Ord gets it
27-09-2018T23:40:28,Mihari,I'm almost certain that would sell out
27-09-2018T23:40:36,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds...potentially problematic Mihari
27-09-2018T23:40:45,unsteddyphoenix,"""Ribbons"""
27-09-2018T23:40:49,Mihari,Not if I pre-select the outfits and they vote.

27-09-2018T23:42:03,Mihari,I'd so get cheetah chirps for my notification sounds! would be awesome.
27-09-2018T23:42:15,Dadrobit,"This week, select backers will get to vote between my silver button down shirt, or my black button down shirt."

27-09-2018T23:48:23,Dadrobit,"Nah, that crap sucks. It just slowly drips and feeds into the rest of the beard throughout the day if you don't get it immediately."
27-09-2018T23:48:34,Dadrobit,Nip it at the bud.
