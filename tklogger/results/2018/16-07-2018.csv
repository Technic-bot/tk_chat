16-07-2018T00:01:09,unsteddyphoenix,Hes done a couple
16-07-2018T00:01:18,Bgrmystr2,Tom's done quite a a few bikinis yeah
16-07-2018T00:01:38,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s not terribly hard to do them I guess
16-07-2018T00:02:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Just make the butt and boobs kinda show around the sides and add strings
16-07-2018T00:02:07,Bgrmystr2,"variety, sage might have the upper hand, slightly"
16-07-2018T00:02:07,unsteddyphoenix,I always liked the swimsuit-skirt thing that kats wearing here https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Flora-and-Kat-on-Spring-Break-122254651
16-07-2018T00:02:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s how I see most of them
16-07-2018T00:02:16,unsteddyphoenix,That style
16-07-2018T00:02:49,Bgrmystr2,kat doesn't have a bikini bottom there lol
16-07-2018T00:03:18,unsteddyphoenix,You get what I mean
16-07-2018T00:03:37,Bgrmystr2,I do
16-07-2018T00:03:53,Dadrobit,lewd
16-07-2018T00:03:54,SpazztasticKiwi,It looks like there’s supposed to be a briefs-like bottom under it and that wrap is a skirt cover for public wear
16-07-2018T00:03:55,Bgrmystr2,I just thought it was interesting she has the waist wrap but nothing else.
16-07-2018T00:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Skirt style is my favorite
16-07-2018T00:04:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Ruffles do the flutter flutter
16-07-2018T00:04:45,Bgrmystr2,hmmm
16-07-2018T00:05:09,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sneakysmirk: *E N H A N C E*
16-07-2018T00:05:31,Dadrobit,"If there's one good thing about AZ, it's the summer wear being a viable option all year 'round."
16-07-2018T00:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah ruffles are good if you want to look bigger too
16-07-2018T00:05:42,Bgrmystr2,Oh. Well color me corrected. She does have a bikini bottom
16-07-2018T00:05:42,Dadrobit,Skin everywhere.
16-07-2018T00:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Good Flora style
16-07-2018T00:06:25,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure how it exists since there's no line off the side where you'd expect it to be
16-07-2018T00:06:31,Bgrmystr2,so.. micro?
16-07-2018T00:07:02,Bgrmystr2,that's.. probably more lewd than not wearing one at all. don't think tom intended that lol
16-07-2018T00:07:04,Dadrobit,"Yeah, she's wearing the strap super low on the hips I guess."
16-07-2018T00:09:22,SpazztasticKiwi,“Minimini” style
16-07-2018T00:09:34,SpazztasticKiwi,But with cover up
16-07-2018T00:09:35,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
16-07-2018T00:10:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I’m not sure miniminis get that low
16-07-2018T00:10:07,Bgrmystr2,covering it up defeats the purpose of wearing such a daring swimsuit to begin with lol
16-07-2018T00:10:19,Bgrmystr2,I've seen some that low.
16-07-2018T00:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be afraid the thing would pop off or drop
16-07-2018T00:10:33,Bgrmystr2,granted I don't think it's something you'd usually buy
16-07-2018T00:10:58,Bgrmystr2,and they are also usually strung higher on the hip
16-07-2018T00:11:42,Bgrmystr2,"having such a small bikini with such a low strap line, not sure how that would work"
16-07-2018T00:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I have one string bikini. Not a huge fan much anymore cause I just like the skirts better
16-07-2018T00:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Tigh it tight and pray it doesn’t fall
16-07-2018T00:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Tie
16-07-2018T00:17:14,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s like 8 styles so who knows. They’re for looks unless you actually like strings up in your everywhere
16-07-2018T00:17:43,Bgrmystr2,some ppl like that kinda thing. :ptv-wondering:
16-07-2018T00:17:47,Bgrmystr2,I dunno
16-07-2018T00:18:06,Dadrobit,Flossing
16-07-2018T00:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And now I’m rethinking my usual brushing my teeth routine
16-07-2018T00:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Thanks
16-07-2018T00:29:43,Dadrobit,:D
16-07-2018T01:01:41,unsteddyphoenix,daddy no~
16-07-2018T01:05:16,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me - that flossing dance is getting banned in schools
16-07-2018T01:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s “intimidating”
16-07-2018T01:07:00,Dadrobit,Daddy yes~~
16-07-2018T01:07:32,Dadrobit,Reminds me of back when I was a security officer and we had our badges taken away because they made us look too intimidating.
16-07-2018T01:12:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I know bottle flipping got banned at my school
16-07-2018T01:12:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And fortune tellers
16-07-2018T01:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And dabbing
16-07-2018T01:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And slap fights
16-07-2018T01:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And that “Pumped up Kicks” song nearly got banned. You couldn’t play it out loud
16-07-2018T01:13:40,Bgrmystr2,dabbing got banned? XD
16-07-2018T01:13:45,unsteddyphoenix,Whaaat
16-07-2018T01:13:52,unsteddyphoenix,Wait are you joking lmoa
16-07-2018T01:13:56,Bgrmystr2,someone in charge is a retard
16-07-2018T01:14:01,unsteddyphoenix,Dabbing??
16-07-2018T01:14:06,unsteddyphoenix,That meme song?/
16-07-2018T01:14:11,Bgrmystr2,is it a song?
16-07-2018T01:14:12,unsteddyphoenix,FORTUNE TELLERS??
16-07-2018T01:14:18,unsteddyphoenix,Pumped up kicks one
16-07-2018T01:14:21,Bgrmystr2,"oh, nvm"
16-07-2018T01:15:41,unsteddyphoenix,"I was mad when back in my day they banned like, trading cards."
16-07-2018T01:15:57,unsteddyphoenix,But dab bans are just absurd lmao
16-07-2018T01:16:36,Bgrmystr2,"my school didn't ban that, but they banned all electronics. All of it. Phones, mp3 players, any kind of games, consoles, all of it."
16-07-2018T01:16:38,Dadrobit,"Oh man, I remember in elementary school the ban against Pokemon."
16-07-2018T01:17:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, electronics were banned when I was in Jr High and up."
16-07-2018T01:17:26,Dadrobit,Now schools provide laptops.
16-07-2018T01:17:39,Dadrobit,It's weird to watch.
16-07-2018T01:17:48,Bgrmystr2,it's a dumb flipflop
16-07-2018T01:18:19,Bgrmystr2,"first electronics were bad cuz they ""made students not pay attention"" now they give them out to everyone freely to ""help them learn"""
16-07-2018T01:18:47,Bgrmystr2,if that's not two sides of the same hypocritical coin..
16-07-2018T01:18:58,Dadrobit,"My mother hates it, so few students actually use them in school FOR school."
16-07-2018T01:19:37,Dadrobit,She's constantly having to tell students to get off of YouTube and Facebook and the like while in class.
16-07-2018T01:20:18,Dadrobit,To say nothing of the rampant cheating.
16-07-2018T01:21:00,Dadrobit,"""Can I listen to my music? It helps me relax while I take the text!"""
16-07-2018T01:21:20,Dadrobit,Turns out kids were listening to the lessons in their earbuds instead.
16-07-2018T01:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,We had a turn around from no phones to yes phones if you’re using it during class for class
16-07-2018T01:21:54,unsteddyphoenix,Really...
16-07-2018T01:22:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And Facebook/social media & YouTube only during breaks
16-07-2018T01:22:05,unsteddyphoenix,Phones out now
16-07-2018T01:22:13,unsteddyphoenix,Thats so WEIRD
16-07-2018T01:22:24,SpazztasticKiwi,You know what happened when Facebook was allowed so much more freely?
16-07-2018T01:22:25,Dadrobit,They'd change the mp3 files to names of music so that it looked all on the up and up until the teachers actually listened to what was being played.
16-07-2018T01:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Fights dropped drastically
16-07-2018T01:23:22,Dadrobit,Only found out when one of the kids earbuds accidentally popped out of the 3.5 jack.
16-07-2018T01:23:39,Dadrobit,And suddenly was blasting the lesson info out of the laptop speakers.
16-07-2018T01:24:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Our principal was so happy he started allowing phone communication freely as long as you weren’t in a lesson or had an assignment in front of you
16-07-2018T01:24:34,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
16-07-2018T01:24:49,unsteddyphoenix,This is lowkey blowing my mind
16-07-2018T01:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And they had to be put away during tests
16-07-2018T01:24:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Obviously
16-07-2018T01:25:29,Dadrobit,I so heavily disagree with this.
16-07-2018T01:25:31,unsteddyphoenix,but can they listen to music?
16-07-2018T01:25:47,Dadrobit,Where's the discipline anymore. Kids need to learn self control.
16-07-2018T01:25:48,unsteddyphoenix,Did fights stop 'cause people were arguing online instead :thinking:
16-07-2018T01:26:04,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed dad
16-07-2018T01:26:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And the mention of trading cards reminds me that card games were pretty much banned because too many were used to bet money and gamble
16-07-2018T01:26:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Gambling was a no no
16-07-2018T01:26:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Well the classic is ""the winner gets to pick a card from the loser"""
16-07-2018T01:26:50,unsteddyphoenix,So I guess
16-07-2018T01:26:54,Dadrobit,Playing for keeps
16-07-2018T01:26:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Listening to music and YouTube was ok as long as, again, it wasn’t during “school stuff time”"
16-07-2018T01:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Cards like yu gi oh and Pokémon is fine
16-07-2018T01:27:40,SpazztasticKiwi,As far as I knew
16-07-2018T01:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And you could battle. If you could find others to play with and had enough time during break
16-07-2018T01:28:12,SpazztasticKiwi,But no betting
16-07-2018T01:28:20,Dadrobit,Pokemon was strictly forbidden. I remember the principal in elementary saying so over the school intercom.
16-07-2018T01:28:39,Dadrobit,I was mostly just angry that he pronounced Pokemon incorrectly.
16-07-2018T01:28:47,Dadrobit,Pokey-Man
16-07-2018T01:28:49,unsteddyphoenix,"""No more of the poke mans"""
16-07-2018T01:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,No more poking men
16-07-2018T01:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds rude
16-07-2018T01:29:20,Dadrobit,Because it was still so new at the time. Little did they know what it would become...
16-07-2018T01:29:22,unsteddyphoenix,No that was still allowed
16-07-2018T01:29:32,Dadrobit,Nope. Playing tag was banned.
16-07-2018T01:30:01,unsteddyphoenix,Really?
16-07-2018T01:30:23,SpazztasticKiwi,The only thing that I saw really really enforced was the no slap or poke fights
16-07-2018T01:30:42,SpazztasticKiwi,It had a 99.9% chance of turning into fists
16-07-2018T01:30:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Theyre called ""pokemon battles"""
16-07-2018T01:30:45,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I've heard of a couple schools banning tag for it being unsafe."
16-07-2018T01:30:49,unsteddyphoenix,Not poke fights
16-07-2018T01:31:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially with the guys
16-07-2018T01:31:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember one time someone put an open condom in the hallway once
16-07-2018T01:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And on the outside fence
16-07-2018T01:32:16,Dadrobit,Oh! Speaking of condoms!
16-07-2018T01:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And a girl dropped a pad on the way to the bathroom
16-07-2018T01:32:41,unsteddyphoenix,Why?
16-07-2018T01:32:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"A CLEAN, UNUSED pad, still in the packaging"
16-07-2018T01:32:56,Dadrobit,LoL just released a sound design article and they were talking a little bit in it about Zac and his dog food condom sounds.
16-07-2018T01:33:14,Dadrobit,"""Zac’s globby sounds were made by filling a condom with dog food and beans and smashing it against the wall."""
16-07-2018T01:33:20,unsteddyphoenix,lmao yup
16-07-2018T01:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,The guys hugged the walls creeping around it and the girls just gave it space
16-07-2018T01:33:30,unsteddyphoenix,Thats some sound design im into
16-07-2018T01:33:55,unsteddyphoenix,Periods are SCARY!!!!! DDD::
16-07-2018T01:34:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Has anyone reached the fill point of a condom
16-07-2018T01:34:09,Bgrmystr2,that sounds nasty dadro lol
16-07-2018T01:34:14,Dadrobit,"Almost finished up with my Death Stranding video with added condom effects, so that'll be fun to get feedback on."
16-07-2018T01:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause those things can E X P A N D
16-07-2018T01:34:27,Bgrmystr2,"prolly not, Kiwi. They're designed line balloons"
16-07-2018T01:34:33,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, with water and stuff maybe"
16-07-2018T01:34:36,Bgrmystr2,for testing
16-07-2018T01:34:46,Bgrmystr2,but not for actual usage..
16-07-2018T01:34:51,unsteddyphoenix,You see various dumb condom activities on the youtube
16-07-2018T01:35:02,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re better than balloons in the blow up quality
16-07-2018T01:35:08,unsteddyphoenix,You have condom effects in your fetus game video?
16-07-2018T01:35:10,unsteddyphoenix,How ironic
16-07-2018T01:35:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen people put their foot in one motion in one of those things
16-07-2018T01:35:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I thought so too. Kind of why I did it."
16-07-2018T01:35:53,Dadrobit,"Also, I didn't have any baloons."
16-07-2018T01:35:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And all the way up the forearm
16-07-2018T01:36:08,Dadrobit,And I really wasn't using the Trojans for anything else anyways.
16-07-2018T01:36:42,SpazztasticKiwi,One tactic to protect your phone from water and dirt is to put it in a dry (no lube) condom
16-07-2018T01:37:09,SpazztasticKiwi,But i don’t feel like explaining to people why there’s a condom on my phone
16-07-2018T01:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,“For phone sex...?”
16-07-2018T01:37:40,Dadrobit,Condoms are also great for protecting microphones while recording wet sounds.
16-07-2018T01:38:18,Dadrobit,Did that to close mic some ground beef that was browning for some rain sounds.
16-07-2018T01:38:19,unsteddyphoenix,"""sorry babe, I ran out of condoms. They're just so USEFUL."""
16-07-2018T01:38:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Well they are
16-07-2018T01:38:43,SpazztasticKiwi,More versatile than the guy sometimes
16-07-2018T01:39:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"I knew a girl in hs that would go to Walmart or a drugstore, go to the condom section and open a box, stuff the condoms in her pocket, and leave"
16-07-2018T01:40:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Some Walmarts lock up their “fun” isle now. Including the lube
16-07-2018T01:40:37,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
16-07-2018T01:40:44,unsteddyphoenix,What a low to sink to
16-07-2018T01:41:21,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ45tpxRsZU
16-07-2018T01:41:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s either that good or that fast, but honey, you do whatever"
16-07-2018T01:43:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m just mentally chanting “no kids pop into the conversation right now, no kids pop into the conversation right now..”"
16-07-2018T01:43:59,Bgrmystr2,eh
16-07-2018T01:44:04,Bgrmystr2,I don't think it matters
16-07-2018T01:44:09,Bgrmystr2,education is important
16-07-2018T01:44:26,Bgrmystr2,denying them the knowledge only makes them pursue it in an obsessive fashion
16-07-2018T01:45:25,unsteddyphoenix,Im basically just learning that I should always have condoms on me
16-07-2018T01:45:42,SpazztasticKiwi,True but I’d hate to be questioned by police if a parent finds their kid is being given the talk by some unknown online
16-07-2018T01:46:35,unsteddyphoenix,I would argue that if a kid has a free internet connection that hasnt had the talk
16-07-2018T01:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You want to know how my biology teacher started the sex ed lesson for us?
16-07-2018T01:46:42,unsteddyphoenix,The parents should be questioned
16-07-2018T01:46:44,Bgrmystr2,"if the parents aren't giving them the talk, then obviously they're going to find out online"
16-07-2018T01:47:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"She never gave any indication it was coming up in the lesson, nor that we were going to get the lesson at all"
16-07-2018T01:47:58,Bgrmystr2,"the police are not gonna question parents just cuz kids find out about sex online, that's a little silly. That's not really something police do anything about, it's a family matter and would be considered a domestic dispute probably"
16-07-2018T01:48:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"But one day in the middle of the week, she comes into the room to start the class and says:"
16-07-2018T01:48:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Penis, Vagina! These are not bad words - they’re body parts!!”"
16-07-2018T01:49:07,SpazztasticKiwi,You could’ve heard a flea fart from the silence that followed
16-07-2018T01:49:40,Dadrobit,*fweeeee*
16-07-2018T01:50:18,unsteddyphoenix,Nice assist dad
16-07-2018T01:50:29,Dadrobit,Thanks
16-07-2018T01:50:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone started looking at each other like “Should we get someone? Is she ok?”
16-07-2018T01:50:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And “tf just happened?”
16-07-2018T01:52:24,SpazztasticKiwi,She had two sons and some of the friends of one were in that class
16-07-2018T01:52:41,unsteddyphoenix,Oh NO lmao
16-07-2018T01:53:52,Bgrmystr2,xDD
16-07-2018T01:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,“Dude. I can’t come over anymore. Your mom scarred me for life”
16-07-2018T01:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Honestly I hear so many dick jokes and such from YouTube it doesn’t phase me anymore
16-07-2018T01:55:52,Dadrobit,"Or maybe it was a Ferris Beuller situation. ""Dude, your mom just got even hotter the other day."""
16-07-2018T01:56:14,SpazztasticKiwi,She was a teacher that was considered one of the hot ones
