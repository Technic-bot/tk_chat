10-05-2018T22:35:01,MuonNeutrino,the geography is totally different for starters

10-05-2018T22:36:42,PotatoRights,like an arctic fox?
10-05-2018T22:36:51,PotatoRights,because foxes exist
10-05-2018T22:36:55,MuonNeutrino,"no reason there couldn't be, but we have no evidence for it"
10-05-2018T22:37:04,PotatoRights,arctic wolves exist
10-05-2018T22:37:13,PotatoRights,why not arctic foxes?
10-05-2018T22:37:19,unsteddyphoenix,because those are FAKE
10-05-2018T22:37:21,MuonNeutrino,ditto for other plausible but currently unseen varieties of canines and felines

10-05-2018T22:39:00,PotatoRights,there could be another island
