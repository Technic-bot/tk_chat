28-03-2018T00:22:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh hey, how's it goin'"
28-03-2018T00:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-excited:
28-03-2018T00:24:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys I almost died today
28-03-2018T00:24:32,TheBeckoner,How'd that go?
28-03-2018T00:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I got in my car to go to work and heard The Buzz of a red wasp
28-03-2018T00:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,It was inches from my elbow
28-03-2018T00:25:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I think I felt my soul leave my body
28-03-2018T00:25:50,unsteddyphoenix,Are you seeing a therapist for your ptsd?
28-03-2018T00:26:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I have something better- cats to pet
28-03-2018T00:26:43,TheBeckoner,Even better than a therapist
28-03-2018T00:26:46,unsteddyphoenix,!! true!
28-03-2018T00:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Then later at work I was loading chickens on the rotisserie oven and there was a little stringy thing on one
28-03-2018T00:27:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I pulled it out of the chicken neck
28-03-2018T00:27:30,SpazztasticKiwi,It was the esophagus
28-03-2018T00:27:57,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's about where i'd expect that to be.
28-03-2018T00:28:17,TheBeckoner,yuuuup
28-03-2018T00:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re supposed to be de-gutted and de-feathered already
28-03-2018T00:28:31,TheBeckoner,stringy stuff freaks me out way too much
28-03-2018T00:28:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Not as bad as the wasp thing though
28-03-2018T00:28:49,TheBeckoner,Extra meat for free
28-03-2018T00:28:52,TheBeckoner,:ok_hand:
28-03-2018T00:29:12,unsteddyphoenix,Throw in a lil' extra how nice of them

28-03-2018T00:30:01,unsteddyphoenix,New writing prompt
28-03-2018T00:30:40,TheBeckoner,Hah
28-03-2018T00:31:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Btw my friend should be joining us soon
28-03-2018T00:31:14,TheBeckoner,Maybe sythe decided not to kill  a rando squirrel one day and Nibs is showin up for somethin important.
28-03-2018T00:31:25,TheBeckoner,New pepple?
28-03-2018T00:31:54,unsteddyphoenix,The more I think about it the more it makes sense
28-03-2018T00:32:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Told em about the streams - sent the link. Evidently, they’re already a supporter"
28-03-2018T00:32:34,TheBeckoner,Moar comrades!
28-03-2018T00:32:52,TheBeckoner,Nibs aint a squirrel best I cant tell
28-03-2018T00:32:56,TheBeckoner,not a normal one...
28-03-2018T00:33:18,SpazztasticKiwi,She has the ear length of a red squirrel
28-03-2018T00:33:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Though the length is actually fuzz tufts
28-03-2018T00:33:41,unsteddyphoenix,Someone pointed out something so obvious in hindsight to me
28-03-2018T00:33:51,unsteddyphoenix,Nibbly was afraid of Reni 'cause Reni can read minds
28-03-2018T00:34:31,SpazztasticKiwi,That makes me interested and cautious of what goes on in Nibs mind
28-03-2018T00:35:12,TheBeckoner,I dunno. Even if Nibs does have plans I doubt Nora cares unless it directly affects Trace in particular
28-03-2018T00:35:42,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-reniderp: &lt;- not nora
28-03-2018T00:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,“I will rule you all one day. Mark my words...”
28-03-2018T00:35:58,TheBeckoner,ha
28-03-2018T00:36:00,TheBeckoner,oops
28-03-2018T00:36:09,TheBeckoner,I totally replaced those word in myt head
28-03-2018T00:36:12,TheBeckoner,my*
28-03-2018T00:37:07,TheBeckoner,Then yeah seems like Reni would probably give away any crazy plans Nibs had since she is a bit more human-concerned than Nora
28-03-2018T00:37:07,unsteddyphoenix,I am super suspicious of Nibbly yet I also support her 100% :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
28-03-2018T00:37:11,Bgrmystr2,what exactly would Nibbly have planned in her mind that she'd be scared of Reni?
28-03-2018T00:37:13,Bgrmystr2,like..
28-03-2018T00:37:15,Bgrmystr2,really?
28-03-2018T00:37:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom how’s the day gone for you - do anything wild, like laundry?"
28-03-2018T00:37:23,Bgrmystr2,she's gonna collect nuts probably.
28-03-2018T00:37:27,Twokinds,Nibbly is actually secretly...
28-03-2018T00:37:32,Twokinds,A :chipmunk: !

28-03-2018T00:38:05,unsteddyphoenix,Consider this Bgr
28-03-2018T00:38:15,unsteddyphoenix,How can Nibbly be a red herring if she's a brown squirrel?
28-03-2018T00:38:28,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s red on the inside
28-03-2018T00:38:44,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: cuz a red herring is a concept, not a real animal. :P"
28-03-2018T00:39:13,Vatruvius,I am at a loss for words right now...

28-03-2018T00:55:10,unsteddyphoenix,My friend just got a job at a supermarket.
28-03-2018T00:55:21,TheBeckoner,Maybe he liked the sound?
28-03-2018T00:55:23,unsteddyphoenix,First day he got home and passed out on the couch within 10 minutes
28-03-2018T00:55:25,TheBeckoner,Low IQ possibly?
28-03-2018T00:55:27,unsteddyphoenix,It does not seem fun
28-03-2018T00:55:35,unsteddyphoenix,True could have OCD
28-03-2018T00:55:38,SpazztasticKiwi,He had a look on his face that said he was impatient
28-03-2018T00:55:41,TheBeckoner,People are exhausting
28-03-2018T00:56:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Like he was mad that I wasn’t right there to help instantaneously
28-03-2018T00:57:47,SpazztasticKiwi,After work I was on my way out buying some gum and there was a couple with a small kid
28-03-2018T00:58:08,unsteddyphoenix,God. Hopefully I can find a job that lets me work from home.
28-03-2018T00:58:18,unsteddyphoenix,Not sure I have the patience for that long term
28-03-2018T00:58:49,TheBeckoner,All the jobs I just applied for are retail. But based on stuff I like so hopefully it aint too bad
28-03-2018T00:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"This kid was grabbing things out of the cart and trying to go ahead and have a snack. When he was denied he started running around the checkout area, and even began moving around and pushing another couple’s cart into their legs as they checked out"

28-03-2018T01:02:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Retails subjective there’s always going to be some people that just make even the job you like to do awful
28-03-2018T01:04:08,TheBeckoner,Yeah...Hopefully I can resist too much sarcasm. I hear it can get yah fired...
28-03-2018T01:04:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Had a guy lose his mind one time on me because I dropped his nickel

28-03-2018T01:09:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Seen a few of those
28-03-2018T01:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the lady that came in and wanted a cake
28-03-2018T01:10:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Then came back complaining that there were “too many sprinkles”

28-03-2018T01:10:42,Vatruvius,I would not survive.
28-03-2018T01:10:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not kidding. I really don’t think there’s anybody in our store that like that lady
28-03-2018T01:10:59,SpazztasticKiwi,*likes
28-03-2018T01:11:04,Vatruvius,I would eventually lose my shit.
28-03-2018T01:11:59,Vatruvius,"""If you don't like the number of sprinkles then remove some. Or if you really want to apply for the baker position and bake them with just the right amount of sprinkles!"""
28-03-2018T01:12:18,Bgrmystr2,maybe ask for no sprinkles?
28-03-2018T01:12:23,Bgrmystr2,and then add sprinkles yourself?

28-03-2018T01:48:25,Vatruvius,I have been watching youtube for the past 4 hours
28-03-2018T01:48:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m jumping on and off
28-03-2018T01:49:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Was watching Mark. Now I’m watching Philip DeFranco
28-03-2018T01:49:14,Vatruvius,I just need something interesting to do while in bed.
28-03-2018T01:49:37,Vatruvius,Did you see Mark's 3 Rage Games video?
28-03-2018T01:49:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
28-03-2018T01:49:52,Vatruvius,Highest of Recomendations

28-03-2018T01:50:10,Vatruvius,If he doesn't already.
28-03-2018T01:50:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like to see a webcam on that watch of his while he plays those games. Watch his heart rate and blood pressure do the chimichanga
28-03-2018T01:51:18,Vatruvius,Just think Kiwi...take Mark's face from his webcam during one of his rage fits and put it on top of a store clerk dealing with annoying customers.
28-03-2018T01:51:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Telling him to stop sure as hell doesn’t work
28-03-2018T01:51:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t like to see Mark mad, that’s the thing"
28-03-2018T01:52:40,Vatruvius,I don't like him being mad either but it is just to damn funny. Plus...I know that pain personally on a regular basis.
28-03-2018T01:52:53,SpazztasticKiwi,He jinxed himself at Christmas when he said he hadn’t been in the hospital but year
28-03-2018T01:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And then he got hit in the eye with a pickle
28-03-2018T01:53:20,Vatruvius,How he handles it is what is funny. Like throwing his chair and mouse in Getting Over It.
28-03-2018T01:54:14,Vatruvius,Who the hell gets hit in the eye with a pickle. He has to know how stupid that sounds. He said we would know what was going on when that ad was released but I have not seen it.
28-03-2018T01:54:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Meanwhile Chica’s just like “what on earth is wrong with you?”
28-03-2018T01:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,At this point I’m not surprised by anything he does
28-03-2018T01:55:43,Vatruvius,"Person: ""What did you do yesterday?"" Other Person: ""I got hit in the eye with a pickle."" Person: ""*snicker*"""
28-03-2018T01:56:18,SpazztasticKiwi,You don’t know weird and unpredictability until you watch Markiplier
28-03-2018T01:56:35,Vatruvius,That is so true. I have been watching him for years.
28-03-2018T01:57:08,Vatruvius,Does it result in years taken of my life...yes. Are those years taken off worth it...yes.
28-03-2018T01:57:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s taking a few years off a few of us, yes"
28-03-2018T01:58:17,SpazztasticKiwi,He was in the hospital back in I think it was “15?
28-03-2018T01:58:34,Vatruvius,There should be a fan game called the Crazed Pickle where you control a pickle flying in the air and you have to guide it to Mark's eye. The more points you get the more upgrades.
28-03-2018T01:58:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Subscriber base had a collective stroke
28-03-2018T01:58:47,Vatruvius,He was in the hospital a lot.
28-03-2018T01:59:00,Vatruvius,Oh yeah.
28-03-2018T02:03:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And then there was the one time he decided to go outside and run around the yard 24 hours after being in the hospital
28-03-2018T02:03:50,Vatruvius,That was so long ago...I vaguely remember him doing that.
28-03-2018T02:03:55,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’ll get rest”
28-03-2018T02:04:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Lier
28-03-2018T02:04:28,Vatruvius,Remember his King of the Squirrels thing?
28-03-2018T02:04:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m - ow - king of the - ow - squirrels - ow-
28-03-2018T02:05:15,Vatruvius,Yes...why...why Mark?
28-03-2018T02:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Somebody duck tape him to a bed
28-03-2018T02:05:45,SpazztasticKiwi,For the sake of everyone’s sanity
28-03-2018T02:05:57,Vatruvius,Tom...we are looking at you. :D
28-03-2018T02:06:25,Vatruvius,Just some duck tape...a face cam...and he will be set.
28-03-2018T02:06:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom probably knows how stubborn Mark is better than we do
28-03-2018T02:07:14,Vatruvius,Yeah...we fans have to duck tape him. We will travel under the disguise of protecting him from the Butt Stabber that was set loose.
28-03-2018T02:07:25,SpazztasticKiwi,At this point I resigned myself to excepting that he’s a grown man and I’m not his mama
28-03-2018T02:07:35,SpazztasticKiwi,*accepting
28-03-2018T02:08:00,Vatruvius,Even though he is like 7 years older than you?
28-03-2018T02:08:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll grow gray hairs too early otherwise
28-03-2018T02:08:41,Vatruvius,I will grow gray hairs from watching Mark.
28-03-2018T02:08:47,unsteddyphoenix,I always thought Toms fans would obviously be the weird ones but after reading this im a bit unsure...
28-03-2018T02:08:57,Vatruvius,lol
28-03-2018T02:09:09,Vatruvius,Must run in the family.
28-03-2018T02:09:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure he’s perfectly capable of taking care of himself. He’s lived up there alone for years so far
28-03-2018T02:10:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And if he does need help Ethan and Tyler are there at least
28-03-2018T02:11:09,Vatruvius,yup
28-03-2018T02:11:52,Vatruvius,Embrace the weird unsteddy!
28-03-2018T02:12:15,unsteddyphoenix,No I am
28-03-2018T02:12:17,unsteddyphoenix,Too cool
28-03-2018T02:12:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you trying to tell me that you don’t think Marks fans are weird
28-03-2018T02:12:19,unsteddyphoenix,And hip
28-03-2018T02:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re not hip; you’re an ass
28-03-2018T02:12:48,unsteddyphoenix,You can be both those things
28-03-2018T02:13:27,Vatruvius,No...one excludes the other.
28-03-2018T02:13:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know Mark seems like a pretty good example of a walking contradiction
28-03-2018T02:14:10,Vatruvius,Mark is...Mark
28-03-2018T02:14:25,Vatruvius,He has his own definition.
28-03-2018T02:14:54,SpazztasticKiwi,“Species Unknown”
28-03-2018T02:15:04,Vatruvius,Look up Mark in a dictionary: a walking contradiction...do not ask.
28-03-2018T02:15:42,Vatruvius,"The living embodiment of ""What?"""
28-03-2018T02:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I have found that Mark wasn’t born with his wittiness; I’m pretty sure he learned it
28-03-2018T02:17:05,TheBeckoner,Good news - didnt lose power
28-03-2018T02:17:06,Vatruvius,Remember his Unnecessary Censorship videos?
28-03-2018T02:17:14,Vatruvius,Good to hear.
28-03-2018T02:17:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Vaguely
28-03-2018T02:17:38,TheBeckoner,also good news - paper isnt due for another week and a half...
28-03-2018T02:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Time to celebrate
28-03-2018T02:17:51,TheBeckoner,Those were funny AVt
28-03-2018T02:17:54,TheBeckoner,Vat*
28-03-2018T02:17:56,Vatruvius,Really Spotify...at this time of night?
28-03-2018T02:18:23,TheBeckoner,I would be happier had I not spent the last 4 hours hardcore procrastinating...
28-03-2018T02:18:29,Vatruvius,I am just listening to some music and they interrupt it with an ad about condoms.
28-03-2018T02:18:40,TheBeckoner,Tryin tell yah somethin
28-03-2018T02:18:50,TheBeckoner,Gotta go get some my dude
28-03-2018T02:18:55,TheBeckoner,forsure
28-03-2018T02:18:56,Vatruvius,But...I already go some.
28-03-2018T02:19:01,Vatruvius,got*
28-03-2018T02:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s happened to me a few times
28-03-2018T02:19:23,TheBeckoner,"Hmm unclear on my part but by ""some"" I ment sex"
28-03-2018T02:19:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just like “ barking up the wrong tree buddy”
28-03-2018T02:19:41,TheBeckoner,meant*(?)
28-03-2018T02:19:43,Vatruvius,What?
28-03-2018T02:19:49,TheBeckoner,nvm
28-03-2018T02:20:01,TheBeckoner,poorly executed tired joke thing
28-03-2018T02:20:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Tomorrow I’m going to be preparing to go see Seán. I’m so excited
28-03-2018T02:21:04,TheBeckoner,Have fun
28-03-2018T02:21:08,Vatruvius,"""Want a sex buddy...call a porn star!"""
28-03-2018T02:21:17,Vatruvius,Who?
28-03-2018T02:21:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m going to post all the pictures when I get there
28-03-2018T02:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Seánn is Jacksepticeye
28-03-2018T02:21:41,TheBeckoner,Hmm
28-03-2018T02:21:44,SpazztasticKiwi,*Seán
28-03-2018T02:21:51,TheBeckoner,I dont think I followed your twitter...
28-03-2018T02:21:52,Vatruvius,I figured...was about to double check on google.
28-03-2018T02:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember when I went to Mark show I tweeted some pictures when I went to it
28-03-2018T02:23:01,TheBeckoner,Yah gonna do that again?
28-03-2018T02:23:05,SpazztasticKiwi,He ended up saying it and liking it. At the time I didn’t know what to do with such information
28-03-2018T02:23:13,SpazztasticKiwi,*seeing it
28-03-2018T02:23:17,TheBeckoner,Gather more of it
28-03-2018T02:23:21,Vatruvius,Lol
28-03-2018T02:23:40,Vatruvius,Someone you love to watch on youtube liking your post.
28-03-2018T02:24:20,Vatruvius,Life complete...
28-03-2018T02:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Well that’s the thing. He’s a cool guy but he said that he’s no hero; he hates hero worship
28-03-2018T02:25:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And sing him in person. He doesn’t glitter anything so he’s just a guy
28-03-2018T02:25:37,SpazztasticKiwi,*seeing him
28-03-2018T02:25:58,Vatruvius,Yeah...he does not like that stuff. I remember a video he posted about winning some award for helping support those in need. I think it was from the Make a Wish Foundation or something.
28-03-2018T02:26:10,Vatruvius,He really did not feel like he deserved it.
28-03-2018T02:27:10,TheBeckoner,Seeing Tom in chat is good enough for me. Sorta cool to see the guy that makes the comic you've been reading for years is a real dude
28-03-2018T02:27:16,Vatruvius,Who else would he be? Some people I think idolize others too much. In the end...they are just another person.
28-03-2018T02:27:26,TheBeckoner,We all peoples
28-03-2018T02:27:29,TheBeckoner,we all die
28-03-2018T02:27:36,TheBeckoner,cool right?
28-03-2018T02:27:54,TheBeckoner,That's what it all ultimately boils down to
28-03-2018T02:27:57,TheBeckoner,ded
28-03-2018T02:28:12,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s how I am. I’m probably going to shake a whole bunch talking to him at PAX but I don’t think I’m going to freak out
28-03-2018T02:28:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope
28-03-2018T02:29:07,TheBeckoner,Takes a lot of my brain power to stay not anxious in situations like that. Idk about you
28-03-2018T02:29:08,Vatruvius,I love Mark's enthusiasm to do good and help others. It is very good to see. His fundraisers and stuff are awesome. I only hope I can make a difference like that to others.
28-03-2018T02:29:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I sometimes imagine him with a wagging tail
28-03-2018T02:29:51,Vatruvius,lol
28-03-2018T02:30:02,Vatruvius,What race is he Kiwi?
28-03-2018T02:30:09,TheBeckoner,Meeting internet people irl for the first time has always been strange to me...
28-03-2018T02:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Haven’t his rice been covered before
28-03-2018T02:30:39,SpazztasticKiwi,*Hasn’t his race been covered before?
28-03-2018T02:30:50,TheBeckoner,I think he meant Keidran or what not
28-03-2018T02:30:52,unsteddyphoenix,I love rice.
28-03-2018T02:30:52,Vatruvius,I mean...when he has a tail?
28-03-2018T02:30:58,TheBeckoner,or however you say it
28-03-2018T02:31:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see him as a golden retriever or labrador
28-03-2018T02:31:40,TheBeckoner,U love rice instead of cat?? Only room for one love unit!
28-03-2018T02:31:55,TheBeckoner,Fitting as he has one
28-03-2018T02:32:03,TheBeckoner,right?
28-03-2018T02:32:08,TheBeckoner,Chica is one of those?
28-03-2018T02:32:09,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-KatDance:
28-03-2018T02:32:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Chica is a golden retriever yeah
28-03-2018T02:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder if Tom’s zoned out the conversation yet
28-03-2018T02:33:41,Vatruvius,Not sure why...but after I get through this one bands album Spotify gives me a lot of German songs...I don't know what they are saying Spotify!
28-03-2018T02:33:55,TheBeckoner,We have this pit-bull lab thing dog. Looks a alot like a demon creature
28-03-2018T02:33:59,TheBeckoner,like a super cute demon
28-03-2018T02:34:19,Vatruvius,Cute and demon do not go together.
28-03-2018T02:34:22,TheBeckoner,All black eyes basically
28-03-2018T02:34:26,TheBeckoner,sure they do
28-03-2018T02:34:35,TheBeckoner,I'll get a pic some time
28-03-2018T02:34:48,TheBeckoner,All white with black eyes lol
28-03-2018T02:36:14,Vatruvius,I have two schnauzers.
28-03-2018T02:36:21,Vatruvius,Pure bred.
28-03-2018T02:37:33,TheBeckoner,We had some of those
28-03-2018T02:38:09,Vatruvius,This was Cosmo when he was a pup. https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9b/0c/9a/9b0c9a80e57b97ec936e26cc2c049ac9--miniature-schnauzer-puppies-schnauzer-puppy.jpg
28-03-2018T02:38:10,TheBeckoner,"One lived to 18 the other to 16 both were larger, which was unusual"
28-03-2018T02:38:19,TheBeckoner,well age wise
28-03-2018T02:38:31,TheBeckoner,Much cute
28-03-2018T02:38:31,Vatruvius,"Not an actual pic, but close to what he looked like."
28-03-2018T02:38:48,TheBeckoner,Yeah our male looked exactly like that iirc
28-03-2018T02:39:06,Vatruvius,"They have great character, that is why I like them."
28-03-2018T02:39:07,TheBeckoner,Vague memory as they died 7 some aood years ago
28-03-2018T02:39:13,TheBeckoner,odd*
28-03-2018T02:39:37,TheBeckoner,"Yeah,barking tends to be an issue unless you train them to listen well"
28-03-2018T02:40:11,TheBeckoner,otherwise nice useful dogs. They keep rats down
28-03-2018T02:40:46,TheBeckoner,"Of course all of our pets are just symbols of what the are capable of, all pampered."
28-03-2018T02:41:18,Vatruvius,"Both my dogs are still living, Cosmo is 15 and Summer is 8-11, I honestly do not remember when we got her. I was still in middle school."
28-03-2018T02:41:25,TheBeckoner,"Well except this lil red heeler thing that we recently got, seem to be more rugged and apt to hunt"
28-03-2018T02:41:49,TheBeckoner,Yeah the get old pretty easy
28-03-2018T02:41:54,TheBeckoner,they*
28-03-2018T02:42:06,Vatruvius,Cosmo got's them bad hips.
28-03-2018T02:42:56,Vatruvius,It is sad to watch him pause half way up stairs to take a break...he was a huge hiker dog when he was younger.
28-03-2018T02:43:14,Vatruvius,Sheer cliff...I got this.
28-03-2018T02:43:21,Vatruvius,Not anymore.
28-03-2018T02:44:59,TheBeckoner,It's hard for humans to see animals age so fast since we age pretty slowly compared to most mammals...but just remember it is normal for the animal. Its just life for them
28-03-2018T02:45:12,TheBeckoner,until we make them immortal...
28-03-2018T02:46:08,Vatruvius,Yup...I understand. This will just be much harder on Keith with Natani or Trace with Flora. I love my dogs but not like that. Talk about hitting the feels.
28-03-2018T02:47:19,TheBeckoner,Yeah. Hopefully that unfortunate side of their interracial relationships is fixed somehow...
28-03-2018T02:47:53,Vatruvius,That or we won't get to that in the story.
28-03-2018T02:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Falling in love with someone who’s on a different age scale would be depressing
28-03-2018T02:48:26,TheBeckoner,"I'd really like to get a Shibu dog for my own pet when I move out. Lots of studying to do on them, but they seem worth it"
28-03-2018T02:48:39,TheBeckoner,Super
28-03-2018T02:48:46,TheBeckoner,I would avoid it
28-03-2018T02:48:48,Vatruvius,They live a long time don't they.
28-03-2018T02:48:57,TheBeckoner,Basitin or human or nothin
28-03-2018T02:49:07,TheBeckoner,Lemme see
28-03-2018T02:49:16,SpazztasticKiwi,But is it not the same for couples that are 10 or so years apart?
28-03-2018T02:49:25,TheBeckoner,oops Shiba*
28-03-2018T02:49:41,TheBeckoner,"I guess so, still more time in that"
28-03-2018T02:50:03,TheBeckoner,"The curve is much steeper when one year equals 5, 6 or 7 of theirs"
28-03-2018T02:50:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but you just know that they’re likely to pass before you
28-03-2018T02:50:17,Vatruvius,"Not really, I do not think so Kiwi. 10 years is just that, where as in Twokinds we are talking about a 50 year difference equivalent."
28-03-2018T02:50:28,unsteddyphoenix,Dont worry trace will fix it trust.
28-03-2018T02:50:37,SpazztasticKiwi,You get my point
28-03-2018T02:50:58,Vatruvius,Kinda...I feel like it is just worse in Twokinds.
28-03-2018T02:51:10,TheBeckoner,wiki says 12-15yrs Vat
28-03-2018T02:51:17,Vatruvius,I mean...I want to do a lot in my life but to only have 20 years!
28-03-2018T02:51:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"I wouldn’t mind someone older, but that kind of factor is something to think about"
28-03-2018T02:51:35,TheBeckoner,Your life would be much different though
28-03-2018T02:51:43,Vatruvius,Hmm...I ran into someone in Vegas that had some Japanese dog that was 22
28-03-2018T02:51:44,TheBeckoner,Humans spend so much time wasting it
28-03-2018T02:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Some don’t have time to go out looking
28-03-2018T02:52:07,TheBeckoner,One had a record at 26 for oldest dog
28-03-2018T02:52:13,SpazztasticKiwi,And others don’t feel they can
28-03-2018T02:52:42,TheBeckoner,looking for?
28-03-2018T02:53:04,SpazztasticKiwi,A partner
28-03-2018T02:54:13,Vatruvius,It is strange to think that I am 20 now and have planned in my teen years to start a family at some point in the next 8 years.
28-03-2018T02:54:14,TheBeckoner,Ah yeah
28-03-2018T02:54:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve developed some rather annoying hiccups. somebody scare me
28-03-2018T02:54:37,TheBeckoner,Im trying to find someone in college. Figure its my best bet
28-03-2018T02:54:46,TheBeckoner,Same Vat
28-03-2018T02:54:58,TheBeckoner,I dont have much time now that Im here lol
28-03-2018T02:55:05,TheBeckoner,Gotta get moving
28-03-2018T02:55:15,TheBeckoner,no more dilly dallying
28-03-2018T02:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Love - ain’t nobody got time for that
28-03-2018T02:55:31,TheBeckoner,almost true
28-03-2018T02:56:00,Vatruvius,"Here you go Kiwi, says it is a super scary jumpscare."
28-03-2018T02:56:04,Vatruvius,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIqAQWj5XlA
28-03-2018T02:56:18,unsteddyphoenix,dilly dally shilly shally
28-03-2018T02:57:15,Vatruvius,"I am with you Beckoner, I plan to find my partner in college. Where I will get my BA or Masters or something. If not there then with all my outside activities after I graduate."
28-03-2018T02:57:34,SpazztasticKiwi,That makes me feel the need to take a shower. Awful lot of moaning
28-03-2018T02:58:08,Vatruvius,Was there...I was also listening to my music. Did it cure your hiccups though?
28-03-2018T02:58:20,TheBeckoner,"A degree would be nice, but not necessary for me. I want my own business."
28-03-2018T02:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m drowning them in cheese

28-03-2018T03:00:44,TheBeckoner,Enough will power will get you pretty much anything.
28-03-2018T03:01:19,Vatruvius,Okay...let me try.

28-03-2018T03:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Short

28-03-2018T03:10:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Expected worse considering, lol"

28-03-2018T03:13:11,TheBeckoner,Being short actually helps quite a bit with weight lifting Im finding.
28-03-2018T03:13:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hey, just think - a lot of girls like y’all guys"
28-03-2018T03:13:26,SpazztasticKiwi,*tall

28-03-2018T03:15:32,TheBeckoner,I do know some dudes where height is a super key factor in a realationship
28-03-2018T03:15:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"For some, “tall” just means “taller than her”"
28-03-2018T03:15:42,TheBeckoner,Right

28-03-2018T12:24:58,WIPKING,if TOM can't die

28-03-2018T12:29:44,WIPKING,still that is a insane amount of time for a comic

28-03-2018T14:14:47,Bigboi182,"Well, It is for just 2 days..."
28-03-2018T14:36:13,Bigboi182,"Woah, Tom can do that?"
28-03-2018T14:36:52,Bigboi182,Also hi Tom!
28-03-2018T14:38:19,Bigboi182,No reply then? That's cool...
28-03-2018T14:42:01,Bigboi182,Kiwi! what's up?
28-03-2018T14:42:20,Bigboi182,XD she just left
28-03-2018T14:48:20,Bigboi182,"Tom, what time will the comic stream be, if you decide to do it today?"
28-03-2018T14:48:46,Bigboi182,I hope that question hasn't been rained on you too much...
28-03-2018T14:51:30,Bigboi182,Sup Vat!
28-03-2018T14:52:32,Vatruvius,Hey...for some reason I cannot see anything in the chat. Just your recent question to Tom.
28-03-2018T14:52:51,Bigboi182,He cleared the chat.
28-03-2018T14:53:08,Bigboi182,For necessary reasons...
28-03-2018T14:53:12,Vatruvius,I see...anyone respond to my dialogue about Mark?
28-03-2018T14:53:19,Bigboi182,Me.
28-03-2018T14:53:21,Vatruvius,Was my dialogue the reason?
28-03-2018T14:53:30,Bigboi182,It's possible...
28-03-2018T14:53:44,Bigboi182,He NEVER clears the chat...
28-03-2018T14:54:02,Bigboi182,And I've been here for months.
28-03-2018T14:55:06,Vatruvius,Huh...I probably would want to avoid any talk in my community if my sibling did something like that. Sorry Tom...quiting this subject now.
28-03-2018T14:55:24,Vatruvius,What have you been up to Bigboi?
28-03-2018T14:55:29,Bigboi182,Not much.
28-03-2018T14:55:43,Bigboi182,I'm actually about to eat.
28-03-2018T14:56:00,Bigboi182,'Cause my lunch wasn't really beneficial...
28-03-2018T14:56:01,Vatruvius,I was about to go make an ice cream cone...
28-03-2018T14:56:11,Bigboi182,Well do that.
28-03-2018T14:56:18,Bigboi182,No one's really here.
28-03-2018T14:56:40,Bigboi182,"We'll go make our food, and be back here."
28-03-2018T14:56:53,Vatruvius,Alright...I will beat you back!
28-03-2018T14:59:02,Bigboi182,Aaaand you lost.
28-03-2018T15:00:55,Vatruvius,Dang it....the ice cream was too hard to scoop.
28-03-2018T15:01:03,Bigboi182,Sure it was...
28-03-2018T15:01:11,Vatruvius,I was lost by a minute too.
28-03-2018T15:01:15,Bigboi182,"That, or you were just too slow..."
28-03-2018T15:04:29,Vatruvius,That is still a lot of signatures.
28-03-2018T15:04:36,Vatruvius,failed pm
28-03-2018T15:06:09,Bigboi182,I know...
28-03-2018T15:07:12,Vatruvius,I need to find a way to kill 2 hours while downloading a game update...
28-03-2018T15:07:48,Bigboi182,Play another game?
28-03-2018T15:08:01,Bigboi182,Specifically a rage one.
28-03-2018T15:08:19,Bigboi182,Try the impossible quiz.
28-03-2018T15:08:42,Bigboi182,It'll make 2 hours look like 2 minutes.
28-03-2018T15:09:22,Vatruvius,Nah...I can't play those types of games.
28-03-2018T15:10:54,Bigboi182,Too late!

28-03-2018T15:11:11,Bigboi182,Just DO IT!
28-03-2018T15:11:32,Vatruvius,I am so exited to watch Ready Player One this weekend.
28-03-2018T15:12:04,Bigboi182,Of Course!
28-03-2018T15:12:24,Vatruvius,Ha...I need Adobe Flashplayer to play...I win!
28-03-2018T15:12:37,Bigboi182,Left click it.

28-03-2018T15:14:42,Bigboi182,You'll need this too.
28-03-2018T15:14:47,Bigboi182,Thank me later.
28-03-2018T15:15:27,Vatruvius,I will probably not play it...I am looking through my game library for games that I can play offline.
28-03-2018T15:16:21,Bigboi182,Why offline games?
28-03-2018T15:16:45,Bigboi182,You can also play this game http://www.y8.com/games/sprinter
28-03-2018T15:16:54,Bigboi182,Just... Try it...
28-03-2018T15:17:18,Vatruvius,Games that will not pull some of my bandwidth while I download this update. My internet is so slow that that number of tasks you do online at once are limited.
28-03-2018T15:17:29,Bigboi182,Jeez
28-03-2018T15:17:54,Bigboi182,Sounds like you have the modern case of shitty internet...
28-03-2018T15:20:06,Vatruvius,Hmm...Enter the Gungeon sounds good. It has been a while since I player that.
28-03-2018T15:21:09,Bigboi182,I wish I actually gave a damn about my steam library...
28-03-2018T15:21:31,Bigboi182,I wanted to pick up a game called Psycho Waluigi.
28-03-2018T15:21:43,Bigboi182,"Well, pick BACK up."
28-03-2018T15:21:43,Vatruvius,What?
28-03-2018T15:22:08,Bigboi182,It's a pretty interesting game.
28-03-2018T15:23:59,Bigboi182,Here's a trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9NTsEwySzg
28-03-2018T15:24:42,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-dealwithit:
28-03-2018T15:24:49,Vatruvius,Hmm...
28-03-2018T15:24:54,Vatruvius,Hey Midnight!
28-03-2018T15:24:55,MidnightBlue78,hello
28-03-2018T15:24:58,Bigboi182,Sup Midnight!
28-03-2018T15:25:08,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: have people been talking this whole time?
28-03-2018T15:25:12,MidnightBlue78,nothing much
28-03-2018T15:25:22,Bgrmystr2,picarto disconnected and then refused to reconnect ever since Kiwi left.
28-03-2018T15:25:26,MidnightBlue78,apparently
28-03-2018T15:25:38,Bgrmystr2,I assumed picarto's chat crashed
28-03-2018T15:25:41,Bgrmystr2,guess not
28-03-2018T15:25:49,MidnightBlue78,"I just got here, so I'm just assuming"
28-03-2018T15:25:54,Bgrmystr2,garbage connectivity :/
28-03-2018T15:26:20,Bigboi182,Yes Bgr...
28-03-2018T15:26:29,Bgrmystr2,Rip
28-03-2018T15:26:44,Bgrmystr2,I saw Kiwi had left right after joining... and that was the last message I saw
28-03-2018T15:27:06,Bgrmystr2,"it proceeded to give me the ""reconnecting chat"" message over and over"
28-03-2018T15:27:30,Bgrmystr2,"refreshing did nothing, clearing cache did nothing. Can only assume the site buggered off somewhere in between."
28-03-2018T15:27:44,Bigboi182,Also Tom cleared the whole chat...
28-03-2018T15:28:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah I saw that earlier
28-03-2018T15:28:25,Bgrmystr2,that was the first message of four
28-03-2018T15:28:30,Bgrmystr2,the only four I saw
28-03-2018T15:31:47,Bigboi182,Yep
28-03-2018T15:36:24,Bigboi182,Everyone's just giving up their hopes on a stream or something?
28-03-2018T15:39:34,Vatruvius,I have just accepted that streams just happen on Friday and Sunday now and anything else is just extra.
28-03-2018T15:40:31,Bigboi182,True.
28-03-2018T15:40:47,Bigboi182,"But i feel that if i do that, I might miss a stream."
28-03-2018T15:40:54,Vatruvius,Alright...I am giving up on this download. I will do it later tonight when I got to bed or something. Time to kill some people in Friday the 13th...or die...if I am unfortunate enough to be a survivor.
28-03-2018T15:41:20,Bigboi182,And it's that anxiety that keeps me coming back here.
28-03-2018T15:41:31,Vatruvius,Understandable.
28-03-2018T15:41:43,Bgrmystr2,"No you won't, big, that's not how it works at all XD"
28-03-2018T15:41:50,Bigboi182,I am thinking about playing some Fortnite or Dirt 4.
28-03-2018T15:42:02,Bigboi182,I know Bgr...
28-03-2018T15:42:23,Bgrmystr2,"I, like Vatru, have already accepted streams happen on Fri and Sunday and everything else is extra. That's not really a debatable thing, it's what actually happened. That being said"
28-03-2018T15:42:42,Bgrmystr2,I still remain here each day hoping for a stream earlier in the week
28-03-2018T15:42:45,Bgrmystr2,I don't expect it
28-03-2018T15:42:58,Bgrmystr2,but I stay.
28-03-2018T15:43:01,Vatruvius,I just hang out here because I can...possible stream or not.
28-03-2018T15:43:06,Bgrmystr2,Ever hopeful. ever hoping.
28-03-2018T15:43:13,Bgrmystr2,..ever watching*
28-03-2018T15:43:24,Bgrmystr2,Never engrishing.
28-03-2018T15:43:54,Bgrmystr2,"I hang out even when there's no stream cuz, yknow, ppl come by and stuff :&gt;"
28-03-2018T15:44:04,Bigboi182,Same. There's always that part of me that thinks Tom will sneak in a stream behind my back.
28-03-2018T15:44:09,Bigboi182,So I stay.
28-03-2018T15:44:21,Bigboi182,And I like the conversations.
28-03-2018T15:44:32,Vatruvius,I do not think he would do that on purpose but now that you mention it I am sure he will.
28-03-2018T15:46:15,Bigboi182,Exactly!
28-03-2018T15:46:53,Bigboi182,I'm not crazy like *cough* WIPKING *cough* but I am a bit concerned.
28-03-2018T15:47:00,Vatruvius,If you do not mention it...it will not be on purpose...so you put yourself in this position Bigboi.
28-03-2018T15:47:12,Bigboi182,True.
28-03-2018T15:47:27,Bigboi182,"Oh well, that's MY problem."
28-03-2018T15:47:56,Vatruvius,Yes it is.
28-03-2018T15:48:03,Vatruvius,lol
28-03-2018T15:48:42,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: Well stream then
28-03-2018T15:48:47,Bigboi182,Speaking of stream...
28-03-2018T15:49:00,Bigboi182,I actually got it right? Damn.
28-03-2018T15:49:03,Vatruvius,Dang it...I was about to kill some plebs!
28-03-2018T15:49:12,GameForge,"woot, this gon be gud"
28-03-2018T15:49:15,Bigboi182,I'm proud of myself.
28-03-2018T15:49:20,GameForge,thursday tho...
28-03-2018T15:49:20,MetalAppleSauce,"Why would the stream stop you, vat?"
28-03-2018T15:49:26,Vatruvius,My pleb killing is going to have to wait...you are safe for now plebs.
28-03-2018T15:49:30,GameForge,ITS A COMIC!!
28-03-2018T15:49:34,Bgrmystr2,"nothing wrong with a thursday, Forge"
28-03-2018T15:49:38,Bigboi182,Woot!
28-03-2018T15:49:46,Bigboi182,More backstory!
28-03-2018T15:50:12,Vatruvius,My pleb killing has to wait because my internet is so bad @MetalAppleSauce that I cannot play the game and watch the stream. It is either one or the other.
28-03-2018T15:50:13,FishCat,Wow
28-03-2018T15:50:48,BadFoMo,Yo.
28-03-2018T15:50:51,Bigboi182,Rose is just learning about Euchre's Templar duty? Wow.
28-03-2018T15:51:03,Bigboi182,Hey FoMo.
28-03-2018T15:51:24,Vatruvius,Rose knew he was in the Templar...weather or not she knows he still is I am not sure.
28-03-2018T15:51:44,Bigboi182,That might be what this page tells us.
28-03-2018T15:52:22,Vatruvius,"Watch that ""users"" count go up."
28-03-2018T15:52:32,Bigboi182,It's gonna go WAY up
28-03-2018T15:52:35,BluePhantom90,hey all
28-03-2018T15:52:38,Bigboi182,Maybe 70+
28-03-2018T15:52:41,Vatruvius,Hey Phantom
28-03-2018T15:52:44,Bigboi182,Hi Blue.
28-03-2018T15:53:14,Bigboi182,I bet Tom's gonna stay pretty silent on this one...
28-03-2018T15:53:23,Bigboi182,And I don't blame him.
28-03-2018T15:53:38,Vatruvius,What do you mean Bigboi?
28-03-2018T15:53:54,TheGamePlayer,hi
28-03-2018T15:53:58,BluePhantom90,hey
28-03-2018T15:53:59,BadFoMo,Hi.
28-03-2018T15:54:07,Vatruvius,Hello Player...hey FoMo!
28-03-2018T15:54:12,TheGamePlayer,oh stream!!!
28-03-2018T15:54:17,TheBeckoner,"Heyo, guess the stream is now!"
28-03-2018T15:54:23,Bigboi182,We've kiiinda stressed him out in terms of relentlessly asking for stream time.
28-03-2018T15:54:31,Vatruvius,Lol...did you seriously just stumble mid stream Player?
28-03-2018T15:54:31,Bigboi182,And stuff like that.
28-03-2018T15:54:32,TheBeckoner,smol bounces
28-03-2018T15:54:37,TheGamePlayer,very laggy on my end
28-03-2018T15:54:57,Bigboi182,Hi all who just showed up.
28-03-2018T15:55:03,BadFoMo,@Bigboi182 We did?
28-03-2018T15:55:07,Vatruvius,I see your point...though he tends to be quiet most of the time anyway. At least from what I have seen.
28-03-2018T15:55:13,SpotTheLeopard,*waves*
28-03-2018T15:55:18,BadFoMo,Hi.
28-03-2018T15:55:18,Bigboi182,Sup spot?
28-03-2018T15:55:19,TheGamePlayer,yep i did thought id say hi and ramble on about something but hey to my surprise a stream
28-03-2018T15:55:23,Vatruvius,Hey Leopard!
28-03-2018T15:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,He is the definition of quiet
28-03-2018T15:55:39,Bigboi182,Hi Kiwi.
28-03-2018T15:56:02,Bigboi182,What was with the log on log off situation earlier?
28-03-2018T15:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-dealwithit:
28-03-2018T15:56:18,Bgrmystr2,"I'm just going to sit here, eat my pizza, and silently enjoy watching Tom work his magic. :ptv-tease:"
28-03-2018T15:56:23,Bigboi182,Yep.
28-03-2018T15:56:26,SpotTheLeopard,"I was about to close out of picarto from another stream, then saw the notification. I've missed so many streams, happy to catch one from the start"
28-03-2018T15:56:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Log on log off situation?
28-03-2018T15:57:07,Bigboi182,"Don't think I didn't see you log in to the stream, then immediately leave when I said hi."
28-03-2018T15:57:15,TheGamePlayer,as much as id like to stay I cant iv got some stuff to do. Love the work Tom... bye everyone
28-03-2018T15:57:16,Vatruvius,lol
28-03-2018T15:57:16,Bigboi182,I saw that.
28-03-2018T15:57:24,Vatruvius,Bye Player!
28-03-2018T15:57:38,Bigboi182,I've been here for 2 hours.
28-03-2018T15:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never been able to see how having the app effects my status online
28-03-2018T15:57:55,Bellhead,Been a while since I logged into this chat...
28-03-2018T15:58:11,Bigboi182,"Y'know, Euchre kinda reminds me of Tom in a way..."
28-03-2018T15:58:15,Bgrmystr2,heya bell
28-03-2018T15:58:20,Bigboi182,Also hi Bell!
28-03-2018T15:58:26,Bellhead,Must be the glasses.
28-03-2018T15:58:26,TheBeckoner,Best I can tell it logs you off when you aren't here kiwi
28-03-2018T15:58:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m always logged into the app, but when I close it, I don’t know if it counts me as offline or not or if I have to be logged out of it to be considered offline"
28-03-2018T15:58:53,Vatruvius,I think having the app open sets you online...if you close the app then you are offline.
28-03-2018T15:59:00,Bigboi182,Yeah.
28-03-2018T15:59:01,TheBeckoner,Pretty sure it makes you offline
28-03-2018T15:59:05,Bellhead,That'd make sense.
28-03-2018T15:59:12,TheBeckoner,Yeah what Vat said
28-03-2018T15:59:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Right now I’m using my phone browser to be online and chat
28-03-2018T15:59:20,TheBeckoner,lool am slow
28-03-2018T15:59:24,rajak,hello
28-03-2018T15:59:29,SpazztasticKiwi,But my app is still logged in
28-03-2018T15:59:31,Vatruvius,Hey!
28-03-2018T15:59:35,Bellhead,Sup.
28-03-2018T15:59:35,Bigboi182,I guess that works...
28-03-2018T15:59:37,Bgrmystr2,hey raj
28-03-2018T15:59:42,Bigboi182,Hi Raj!

28-03-2018T16:00:20,Vatruvius,You are online Kiwi if you are just chatting as well. Web browser or app...does not matter.
28-03-2018T16:00:21,Bigboi182,"Not me, that's for sure..."
28-03-2018T16:00:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he tall boy
28-03-2018T16:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Though there’s also when I close the app but don’t clear it. It sits in my phone’s background activity
28-03-2018T16:01:17,TheBeckoner,Tall and old boi
28-03-2018T16:01:17,Vatruvius,When it is in your phone's background you are online.
28-03-2018T16:01:31,Bigboi182,"But as I was saying, I think Euchre kinda is like Tom in a way...."
28-03-2018T16:01:41,Vatruvius,What?
28-03-2018T16:01:43,TheBeckoner,Uhh
28-03-2018T16:01:51,TheBeckoner,Tom is actually in the comic tho??
28-03-2018T16:01:59,Vatruvius,Euchre is like Tom?
28-03-2018T16:02:02,Bigboi182,"Wait, hear me out on this one."
28-03-2018T16:02:12,Bigboi182,His calm nature.
28-03-2018T16:02:16,Bigboi182,The glasses.
28-03-2018T16:02:17,Bellhead,"I'll bite. How, aside from the glasses and mysterious I-know-everything-ness?"
28-03-2018T16:02:21,TerraTheWizard,boop. hello chat peoples
28-03-2018T16:02:35,TheBeckoner,Heyo Terra
28-03-2018T16:02:40,Vatruvius,"I just want to know what you meant ""as I was saying?"" That came out of nowhere."
28-03-2018T16:02:55,Bellhead,He said it earlier.
28-03-2018T16:02:57,Vatruvius,Hello Terrra!
28-03-2018T16:03:00,Bigboi182,Because I said it earlier and no one noticed.
28-03-2018T16:03:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a wizard :ptv-greetings:
28-03-2018T16:03:09,Whitestripes,"Hello, peeps"
28-03-2018T16:03:20,Bellhead,How goes?
28-03-2018T16:03:21,Bgrmystr2,"Hey Terra, white."
28-03-2018T16:03:27,Vatruvius,Found it...you are right Bigboi.
28-03-2018T16:03:40,Bigboi182,"I'm sure if tom put himself into the comic, he'd be something like Euchre."
28-03-2018T16:03:50,TerraTheWizard,tom is in the comic tho
28-03-2018T16:03:51,TerraTheWizard,lol
28-03-2018T16:03:58,Pimsan,No guests? What  does that mean?
28-03-2018T16:04:02,TheBeckoner,Late but Hey white
28-03-2018T16:04:06,Bigboi182,As a background charachter.
28-03-2018T16:04:10,Vatruvius,But...he was the pizza guy and postal guy?
28-03-2018T16:04:13,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s the director of the comic when everyone’s on stage
28-03-2018T16:04:15,Whitestripes,"Hey, Beck"
28-03-2018T16:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And orders the snacks
28-03-2018T16:04:29,Bgrmystr2,"lol Terra, naw"
28-03-2018T16:04:34,Whitestripes,"Tom is like Stan Lee, he is a cameo man"
28-03-2018T16:04:39,TheBeckoner,Doughnut Producer*
28-03-2018T16:04:39,Bigboi182,It means that you can't just be anonymous Pim...
28-03-2018T16:04:44,TheBeckoner,very serious job
28-03-2018T16:04:46,Bgrmystr2,It's definitely a different person.
28-03-2018T16:04:47,Pimsan,Ah!
28-03-2018T16:04:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Very important job
28-03-2018T16:05:04,Bellhead,"He's the background character whose monotony is only used on, like, one page, just to show a break in the action."
28-03-2018T16:05:04,TheBeckoner,yesyes
28-03-2018T16:05:07,Bigboi182,"So what, He makes the guys chicken or something?"
28-03-2018T16:05:10,Unenlagia,Deliciously important
28-03-2018T16:05:14,Bgrmystr2,Any connection to persons living or dead is entirely coincidental. :ptv-condescending:
28-03-2018T16:05:17,Bigboi182,Tom's Frie Chicken.
28-03-2018T16:05:22,Bigboi182,*Fried.
28-03-2018T16:05:24,TheBeckoner,*Except Nibbly
28-03-2018T16:05:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Pizza and doughnuts mainly
28-03-2018T16:05:37,SpazztasticKiwi,But maybe chicken too
28-03-2018T16:05:53,Vatruvius,Jalapeno Pizza and Doughnuts Kiwi
28-03-2018T16:05:54,SpotTheLeopard,"Well, they say write what you know, and you're bound to share some traits with some characters created along the way"
28-03-2018T16:06:10,Vatruvius,The say that Leopard?
28-03-2018T16:06:16,Vatruvius,Where? When?
28-03-2018T16:06:18,Bellhead,"Look hard enough, and you share traits with everyone, ever."
28-03-2018T16:06:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can imagine him swinging by McDonald’s for the order “I need about 200 raw hamburgers” “Excuse me, sit?”"
28-03-2018T16:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,*sir
28-03-2018T16:06:45,SpotTheLeopard,"so I have heard. that mysterious ""they"""
28-03-2018T16:06:52,Vatruvius,Lol...yes Kiwi.
28-03-2018T16:07:02,Bigboi182,"If he knew how to make fried chicken that was somehow better than KFC, TFC would be the #1 chicken company in the world."
28-03-2018T16:07:30,Bigboi182,Because popeye's was pretty dead anyway.
28-03-2018T16:07:33,Vatruvius,There would be a TFC bucket in every page of the comic somewhere.
28-03-2018T16:07:47,Bigboi182,I actually wanna see that now...
28-03-2018T16:08:02,Bellhead,"Well, there is that penguin in the earlier ones..."
28-03-2018T16:08:14,Bigboi182,"Wow, 40 people in the chat already?"
28-03-2018T16:08:30,TerraTheWizard,:thinking:
28-03-2018T16:08:34,Vatruvius,No...just 40 users. If there was actually 40 people chatting this would be chaos.
28-03-2018T16:08:42,Bigboi182,True.
28-03-2018T16:08:51,Bellhead,Darn right. Wouldn't be able to read anything/
28-03-2018T16:09:07,Bgrmystr2,"Technically, Big is right"
28-03-2018T16:09:07,Vatruvius,I feel like we got 10 people actively chatting right now.
28-03-2018T16:09:11,Bigboi182,It's probably half of that number who are actually chatting right now.
28-03-2018T16:09:11,Bgrmystr2,40 people are in the chat
28-03-2018T16:09:18,SpazztasticKiwi,“Costumer complainants are to be filed with the tiger out back”
28-03-2018T16:09:19,Bgrmystr2,just most of them are not typing
28-03-2018T16:09:29,Vatruvius,Shut Bgr...not one loves you! :ptv-hearts:
28-03-2018T16:09:31,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't mean they can't
28-03-2018T16:09:36,Bellhead,"Evil Trace, I presume?"
28-03-2018T16:09:38,Bgrmystr2,I love me.. :ptv-sad:
28-03-2018T16:09:44,Vatruvius,Yes Kiwi!
28-03-2018T16:10:04,Bigboi182,I kind of hope that WIPKING doesn't show up...
28-03-2018T16:10:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the see're, Bell"
28-03-2018T16:10:12,Bigboi182,Yeah.
28-03-2018T16:10:21,HeresyArtStream,Hi all!
28-03-2018T16:10:28,TerraTheWizard,hey heresy!
28-03-2018T16:10:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,evil trace is not that pretty
28-03-2018T16:10:32,Bigboi182,He wants Trace's position as grand templar.
28-03-2018T16:10:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Heresy
28-03-2018T16:10:33,Vatruvius,The lack of the triangle thing makes me think it that other Templar dude...I cannot remember his name.
28-03-2018T16:10:34,TerraTheWizard,lol marv
28-03-2018T16:10:40,Bigboi182,Hi Heresy.
28-03-2018T16:10:46,TerraTheWizard,it's Brahn
28-03-2018T16:10:56,Vatruvius,Yes...Brahn
28-03-2018T16:11:10,Bellhead,"Yeah, I see see it now."
28-03-2018T16:11:17,Vatruvius,Plus...he is missing Trace's hair thing.
28-03-2018T16:11:18,Bigboi182,Hopefully he won't get that powerful.
28-03-2018T16:11:47,Bgrmystr2,"the ahoge, Vatru?"
28-03-2018T16:11:56,Twokinds,Originally this panel was just Euchre talking but I decided to draw Seer Brahn because... with such a long running comic I'm sometimes unsure if people remember who that is XD
28-03-2018T16:12:08,Bgrmystr2,xD
28-03-2018T16:12:11,Bigboi182,But Tom might make Brahn become Grand Templar and have Trace and Co. take him down.
28-03-2018T16:12:13,Bigboi182,XD
28-03-2018T16:12:18,Vatruvius,Well...I have made your point Tom
28-03-2018T16:12:20,Bigboi182,That works too...
28-03-2018T16:12:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
28-03-2018T16:12:23,Bgrmystr2,"Brahn? :ptv-wondering: Was he a character in your comic, Tom?"
28-03-2018T16:12:28,Bellhead,It's also nie for a change of background during conversation./ Well placed.
28-03-2018T16:12:34,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
28-03-2018T16:12:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bgr he was in AI
28-03-2018T16:12:56,Bgrmystr2,marv shh
28-03-2018T16:13:03,Bgrmystr2,check your sarcasm detector
28-03-2018T16:13:08,Vatruvius,Thanks for the added word to my dictionary Bgr
28-03-2018T16:13:09,Twokinds,Yeah it's nice to see what people are talking about
28-03-2018T16:13:16,Bigboi182,he was introduced around chapter 14 or something...
28-03-2018T16:13:29,Bigboi182,I REALLY have to reread the comic...
28-03-2018T16:13:31,Bellhead,"Mind the insanity, though. It's contageous."
28-03-2018T16:14:23,TerraTheWizard,brahn's been around since pretty early on in the comic
28-03-2018T16:14:26,Bgrmystr2,np vatru xD
28-03-2018T16:14:33,Bgrmystr2,though I dunno what I said that you didn't know of
28-03-2018T16:14:38,Bellhead,"Hmm... Brahn's left eye has a flattened area under it. Almost makes him look anxious, maybe a touch of worried."
28-03-2018T16:14:51,Bigboi182,That blank face... you know he's planning something...
28-03-2018T16:14:51,Sammit,Hi everybody
28-03-2018T16:14:53,Vatruvius,Ahoge...never knew that.
28-03-2018T16:14:58,Bgrmystr2,"oh, yeah"
28-03-2018T16:14:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sam
28-03-2018T16:15:03,Bigboi182,You just don't know what it is...
28-03-2018T16:15:10,Bigboi182,Hi Sam.
28-03-2018T16:15:14,Bgrmystr2,the lil hair thing that sticks out of the top of trace's head
28-03-2018T16:15:19,Bgrmystr2,Flora has two of em lol
28-03-2018T16:15:30,Bellhead,Trace's Mohawk.
28-03-2018T16:15:31,Bigboi182,True Bgr.
28-03-2018T16:15:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Hair fluff tufts
28-03-2018T16:16:06,TerraTheWizard,what i've said about flora's hair thingies before:
28-03-2018T16:16:12,Bigboi182,"Or in Flora's case, a mind controller!"
28-03-2018T16:16:17,TerraTheWizard,"the tigresses have feathers, flora does it with her hair"
28-03-2018T16:16:27,Bellhead,Oh but remember that side comic where Flora cut it off of him?
28-03-2018T16:16:34,Vatruvius,Yeah
28-03-2018T16:16:43,Vatruvius,"""My head feels lighter."""
28-03-2018T16:16:44,Bigboi182,That was pretty funny.
28-03-2018T16:16:46,Bellhead,Good times...
28-03-2018T16:17:20,Bigboi182,Remember that side comic when Nibbly controlled flora through her hair?
28-03-2018T16:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I have one of those gravity defying tufts on the side of my head
28-03-2018T16:17:30,Vatruvius,If it was that heavy it should not have been standing up but...Tom physics.
28-03-2018T16:17:43,Bigboi182,"Yeah, Tom Physics."
28-03-2018T16:17:46,Vatruvius,Ohh really Kiwi?
28-03-2018T16:17:54,Bellhead,BBest explanation ever.
28-03-2018T16:17:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I put my hair in a ponytail, it curls up and does not lay down no matter what"
28-03-2018T16:18:02,Bigboi182,That sounds interesting.
28-03-2018T16:18:03,TerraTheWizard,it's where trace's magic comes from
28-03-2018T16:18:10,TerraTheWizard,the magic keeps it stuck up
28-03-2018T16:18:17,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-florajiggle::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-florajiggle:
28-03-2018T16:18:18,Bigboi182,Bounce!
28-03-2018T16:18:18,SpazztasticKiwi,It looks like a small horn kinda
28-03-2018T16:18:31,Bigboi182,Cool.
28-03-2018T16:18:36,Bigboi182,I guess.
28-03-2018T16:18:39,Vatruvius,It is the magic trying to find a way out of Trace like in those volcanic pools making rocks float.
28-03-2018T16:18:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
28-03-2018T16:19:07,Bellhead,That WOULD explain his tremendous power in his early Templar years..
28-03-2018T16:19:16,Vatruvius,It would.
28-03-2018T16:19:27,Bigboi182,Yep.
28-03-2018T16:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Or he has a ghost constantly playing with his hair
28-03-2018T16:19:32,Bigboi182,XD
28-03-2018T16:19:33,TerraTheWizard,lol kiwi
28-03-2018T16:19:40,Bellhead,"That could be, too."
28-03-2018T16:19:49,Vatruvius,Nora seems to be able to distinguish Trace's magic or others...so I would assume other dragons can as well?
28-03-2018T16:19:50,TerraTheWizard,so that's what saria's up to
28-03-2018T16:19:57,Bigboi182,XD Terra
28-03-2018T16:19:58,TerraTheWizard,holding traces hair up
28-03-2018T16:20:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta play with the floof
28-03-2018T16:20:18,Vatruvius,over* not or
28-03-2018T16:20:18,Bigboi182,Well at least she's doing something good for him.
28-03-2018T16:20:33,Bellhead,"@Vat: It's likely an acquired skill, after, ya know.. several centuries of practice."
28-03-2018T16:20:45,Bigboi182,"If WIPKING was here, he'd lose his mind..."
28-03-2018T16:20:56,Bellhead,Who's that?
28-03-2018T16:21:08,Bigboi182,You don't wanna know...
28-03-2018T16:21:15,Bgrmystr2,"naw he's gonna lose his mind anyway, cuz he missed today :P"
28-03-2018T16:21:21,GameForge,wub
28-03-2018T16:21:30,Bgrmystr2,so nothing of value was changed anyway
28-03-2018T16:21:31,Bigboi182,XD Bgr.
28-03-2018T16:21:38,Bigboi182,That is true.
28-03-2018T16:21:48,Vatruvius,Yes...but Trace is suppose to be really powerful and has shown to be so. Since dragons are being of magic they have to be able to detect ones magic. With that in mind...where does that put Trace on the scale of magical beings in terms of power?
28-03-2018T16:21:50,Bellhead,"He's not... No, he couldn't be, if you're still worried about him..."
28-03-2018T16:22:07,Bigboi182,His mind will be long gone regardless of what happens...
28-03-2018T16:22:16,Bgrmystr2,haha
28-03-2018T16:22:24,Vatruvius,Poor WIPKING
28-03-2018T16:22:34,Bigboi182,I know right?
28-03-2018T16:22:52,Vatruvius,We need a WIPKING bash counter.
28-03-2018T16:22:56,Bellhead,Is that badfomo? Or somebody else?
28-03-2018T16:22:58,Bigboi182,Agreed.
28-03-2018T16:23:00,SpazztasticKiwi,His amnesia has likely subconsciously locked his true/full power away
28-03-2018T16:23:04,Bgrmystr2,"Trace would be pretty high, Vatru"
28-03-2018T16:23:11,Bigboi182,Someone else Bell.
28-03-2018T16:23:16,Bgrmystr2,"in terms of humans, he's one of the most powerful"
28-03-2018T16:23:32,Bellhead,"Okay, then... Probably not from my era here..."
28-03-2018T16:23:44,Bigboi182,He isn't...
28-03-2018T16:23:45,Bgrmystr2,though it's unlikely he's as powerful as Nora herself
28-03-2018T16:23:48,Vatruvius,I am more curious as to where Trace sits among dragons...as dragons get stronger with age.
28-03-2018T16:23:59,aeoronwah,Heya
28-03-2018T16:24:05,TerraTheWizard,nora is cheat-mode  power levels
28-03-2018T16:24:06,Bgrmystr2,maybe powerful as some younger dragons? But that's just my thoughts on it
28-03-2018T16:24:07,Vatruvius,Hello.
28-03-2018T16:24:09,Bigboi182,Nora would kick Trace's ass in a magic fight.
28-03-2018T16:24:14,Bellhead,Oh? And how would YOU know that?
28-03-2018T16:24:15,Bellhead,:P
28-03-2018T16:24:27,Vatruvius,I would think Trace would fall somewhere with young dragons...yes.
28-03-2018T16:24:35,Bigboi182,Have you seen what Nora can do?
28-03-2018T16:24:49,TerraTheWizard,trace is babby dragon confirmed :ptv-kippi2:
28-03-2018T16:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can see it now. Trace is 80. He sneezes and because his power has mean growing exponentially each year, a mountain does a glip"
28-03-2018T16:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,*flip
28-03-2018T16:25:01,Bellhead,"I'd also bet Trace would beat Reni, if it came to it... But OLD Trace? He was a BEAST."
28-03-2018T16:25:02,Vatruvius,I think Nora gets bored and does what she wants to amuse herself.
28-03-2018T16:25:03,Bigboi182,I don't think you would be questioning my theorry if so.
28-03-2018T16:25:24,Bigboi182,Of course trace could beat Reni.
28-03-2018T16:25:36,Bigboi182,She's kinda weak in comparison.
28-03-2018T16:25:50,Grishmark,Hello all
28-03-2018T16:25:55,Bellhead,Isn't he also about as old?
28-03-2018T16:25:56,Bgrmystr2,"Bellhead, Tom stated a couple days back that not even at his craziest would evil trace betray Nora."
28-03-2018T16:26:08,Sammit,Hi Grishmark
28-03-2018T16:26:13,Bigboi182,"Old Trace could beat Nora, but It would be pretty intense."
28-03-2018T16:26:20,Bgrmystr2,Doubt that
28-03-2018T16:26:21,Vatruvius,I would hope Trace is more powerful than Reni...she is only 20 right? Though his powers are locked away...he in theory should be more powerful right? Otherwise dragons of any age would be way to powerful compared to other races.
28-03-2018T16:26:33,Bgrmystr2,"Evil trace was likely never as powerful as Nora is, not even close"
28-03-2018T16:26:41,Bigboi182,"We know Bgr, but this is more of a ""What If?"" Question."
28-03-2018T16:26:43,Bgrmystr2,but powerful enough to give challenge
28-03-2018T16:26:50,Bigboi182,Agreed.
28-03-2018T16:26:56,Bellhead,"Oh, of course not. I'd think Trace would know better, at anyy stage, but would he have the strength?"
28-03-2018T16:27:04,Vatruvius,That makes Trace a little scary.
28-03-2018T16:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,That Brahn guy has no life in his eyes
28-03-2018T16:27:21,Bellhead,Nope. That's kinda who he is.
28-03-2018T16:27:26,Bigboi182,Old Trace was ALWAYS scary Vat...
28-03-2018T16:27:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Kiwi, couse he be a robot"
28-03-2018T16:27:46,Vatruvius,Nora...God level. Trace...demigod on verge of becoming a God.
28-03-2018T16:27:56,sunblaze,hiya
28-03-2018T16:27:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Even robots have a glimmer of at least electricity in their eyes
28-03-2018T16:28:01,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if becoming god, per se"
28-03-2018T16:28:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sun
28-03-2018T16:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,This guy has nothing there
28-03-2018T16:28:09,Vatruvius,What I mean is having the power to challenge Nora...the sheer power.
28-03-2018T16:28:09,Bgrmystr2,but demigod level perhaps
28-03-2018T16:28:10,Bigboi182,He just needs a little push.
28-03-2018T16:28:15,microbuss,"yo, dudes Wazzup?/"
28-03-2018T16:28:16,Bellhead,"And BigBoi, I bet you remember me from before... Who did you used to be?"
28-03-2018T16:28:17,Bgrmystr2,"also, hey sunblaze"
28-03-2018T16:28:19,Bgrmystr2,hey micro
28-03-2018T16:28:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Buss
28-03-2018T16:28:28,sunblaze,yoyo everyone and thanks
28-03-2018T16:28:32,microbuss,hey Marvin hehe
28-03-2018T16:28:40,Vatruvius,Hey all joining in!
28-03-2018T16:29:07,Bigboi182,Sup Blaze!
28-03-2018T16:29:20,Bigboi182,I used to be.... someone...
28-03-2018T16:29:27,Bigboi182,Let's just say that...
28-03-2018T16:29:29,Sammit,Hi Sun and Bus
28-03-2018T16:29:32,Bellhead,"Well, duh..."
28-03-2018T16:29:33,TerraTheWizard,:thinking:
28-03-2018T16:29:50,Bigboi182,"I'm not telling you, obviously..."
28-03-2018T16:30:02,microbuss,sillies y'all is
28-03-2018T16:30:14,Bellhead,"Let's see... Were you ever banned from the forums, for any period of time?"
28-03-2018T16:30:15,microbuss,brb
28-03-2018T16:30:21,Bigboi182,Yep...
28-03-2018T16:30:39,Bellhead,"You're not KK, are you?"
28-03-2018T16:30:42,Vatruvius,I guess Trace being powerful enough to challenge Nora makes sense considering he summoned a dragon when he lost his memories.
28-03-2018T16:31:05,Bigboi182,No...
28-03-2018T16:31:14,TerraTheWizard,well nora called it cute iirc
28-03-2018T16:31:16,Bigboi182,Not hiim...
28-03-2018T16:31:21,Bgrmystr2,why would you try to guess Bell
28-03-2018T16:31:26,TerraTheWizard,"like, big dragon could kill them all is ""cute"""
28-03-2018T16:31:27,Bgrmystr2,not like he's gonna tell you lol
28-03-2018T16:31:32,microbuss,forgot food
28-03-2018T16:31:54,Vatruvius,That was funny Terra...
28-03-2018T16:31:54,Bgrmystr2,"and  yeah, trace would never win against nora. He can't kill her."
28-03-2018T16:31:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,how dare you forget food
28-03-2018T16:32:04,Bigboi182,"Ok fine, I'll tell you."
28-03-2018T16:32:14,Bigboi182,I used to be Carlitob1010.
28-03-2018T16:32:20,Bigboi182,There I said it.
28-03-2018T16:32:30,Bigboi182,I've changed since then.
28-03-2018T16:32:36,Vatruvius,Too early for me...I know you as Bigboi so...
28-03-2018T16:32:42,Bigboi182,Good.
28-03-2018T16:32:48,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: big why
28-03-2018T16:32:52,Bigboi182,Let's keep it that way.
28-03-2018T16:33:03,Bgrmystr2,"you ruined it, you can't keep it that way anymore xD"
28-03-2018T16:33:09,Bellhead,"Too late for me, in al;l honesty. That was after my time."
28-03-2018T16:33:23,MefjuTK,Hey guys. Shedule has change?
28-03-2018T16:33:23,Bigboi182,Oh well...
28-03-2018T16:33:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"as long as you're awesome to people, don't care what you want to be called"
28-03-2018T16:33:34,Bellhead,Do you rmemeber KK?
28-03-2018T16:33:35,Bgrmystr2,"yeah last weekk, Mefju"
28-03-2018T16:33:41,Bigboi182,Not really...
28-03-2018T16:33:42,Vatruvius,My time in the Twokinds prison...the worst there is. You see some shit when you go there.
28-03-2018T16:33:46,Vatruvius,:ptv-hearts:
28-03-2018T16:33:47,MefjuTK,"Oh, why?"

28-03-2018T16:34:06,Bgrmystr2,"because there was too much pressur, basically,"
28-03-2018T16:34:12,Bgrmystr2,pressure*
28-03-2018T16:34:14,Whitestripes,So there will be stream tomorrow?
28-03-2018T16:34:19,Bellhead,"Not really, or no?"
28-03-2018T16:34:19,Bgrmystr2,Friday? Likely.
28-03-2018T16:34:21,Unenlagia,Exile is no fun
28-03-2018T16:34:22,Bellhead,That was quite the time.
28-03-2018T16:34:23,Vatruvius,I was kicked from the chat...I just rejoined.
28-03-2018T16:34:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"my bounce reaction time is shit on this laptop, pls forgive"
28-03-2018T16:34:36,Bigboi182,"And it was a bit of a ""joke kick."""
28-03-2018T16:34:45,Vatruvius,"It was a ""shut up"" kick."
28-03-2018T16:35:01,Bigboi182,Flashback to the White Chocolate incident...
28-03-2018T16:35:05,Vatruvius,Anyway...
28-03-2018T16:35:06,Bgrmystr2,"it's ok marv, we can't always expect on-time bouncies."
28-03-2018T16:35:11,Bgrmystr2,shit happens.

28-03-2018T16:38:36,Bellhead,"BB182, YOU don't want to know. Dark times to be on the forum. He was.. not pleasant."
28-03-2018T16:38:41,Bgrmystr2,"I don't need to make myself feel old, big"
28-03-2018T16:38:42,microbuss,i was around in 2003 but I don't think I discovered this comic until 2013 or so
28-03-2018T16:38:44,Bgrmystr2,I'm always old.
28-03-2018T16:38:44,Bigboi182,XD

28-03-2018T16:38:57,Bigboi182,Vat with the burn.
28-03-2018T16:39:02,Bgrmystr2,I don't think serp was older than me though
28-03-2018T16:39:08,Bgrmystr2,he was still in his 20s
28-03-2018T16:39:11,Bgrmystr2,far as I recall
28-03-2018T16:39:12,Bigboi182,"It was that bad, Bell?"

28-03-2018T16:40:14,TheBeckoner,We'll get you some bionic legs before that point Bgr
28-03-2018T16:40:15,microbuss,IF there was a Draft NOW Would you all fight to keep out of the military?
28-03-2018T16:40:17,Tylertt,ok what have I stumbled onto in this chat?
28-03-2018T16:40:20,Bigboi182,Oh sheeeeet...
28-03-2018T16:40:34,Bigboi182,Some thing messed up Tyler...

28-03-2018T16:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,My grandpa was in the Vietnam war
28-03-2018T16:40:47,Bellhead,Yeah. SOOO glad you're not him.

28-03-2018T16:40:56,TheBeckoner,Mine too I think Spazz
28-03-2018T16:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s also passed away
28-03-2018T16:41:01,Bigboi182,Yeah... Me too...
28-03-2018T16:41:24,Bigboi182,"Ok, good to know I guess."
28-03-2018T16:41:28,SpazztasticKiwi,My other grandpa I believe was in the Korean War
28-03-2018T16:41:43,Bigboi182,Oh. Interesting.
28-03-2018T16:41:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t know for sure or if I have that mixed up though
28-03-2018T16:41:56,Tylertt,so some of you are talking about their families' past... so I might as well join in
28-03-2018T16:42:12,SpotTheLeopard,"Old/young, doesn't matter much if you can live well and happily. My grandma went on cruises and horseback riding in her 90's."
28-03-2018T16:42:20,Bigboi182,"You may not want to mention that to Tom, since he's... you know... Half-Korean..."
28-03-2018T16:42:32,TheBeckoner,Lol he wasnt around for it
28-03-2018T16:42:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t help my family’s past
28-03-2018T16:42:41,Bigboi182,True.
28-03-2018T16:42:55,Bigboi182,BRB.
28-03-2018T16:42:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad was almost sent to Desert Storm
28-03-2018T16:43:10,WarToWin,hello
28-03-2018T16:43:13,Vatruvius,Tom's dad was in the US military if I am correct so...his family was on our side.
28-03-2018T16:43:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Knew a guy from desert storm, he was a tank commando"
28-03-2018T16:43:34,Vatruvius,brb
28-03-2018T16:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Dad’s dad was navy. My mom’s dad was Air Force. My dad was national guard
28-03-2018T16:44:37,Bellhead,Dad and dad's dad were in Nat'd guard. Dad still is.
28-03-2018T16:44:51,Twokinds,My dad serving in Korea is why I exist
28-03-2018T16:44:51,Tylertt,My Mum's Mum was a nurse in WW2 where she met my mum's mum's dad
28-03-2018T16:44:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Grand dad was air force,"
28-03-2018T16:45:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool Tom
28-03-2018T16:45:06,MidnightBlue78,x3
28-03-2018T16:45:21,MidnightBlue78,hurray for that!
28-03-2018T16:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad’s dad is the only one of the three still alive though
28-03-2018T16:45:37,Bellhead,"Fun fact: you can get kicked out of the army by being too old, even if you perform better than half the people there."
28-03-2018T16:45:44,Twokinds,And it's sorta why Twokinds exists in a roundabout way XD
28-03-2018T16:45:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,MIDNIGHT!!!!!:ptv-hearts:
28-03-2018T16:45:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw

28-03-2018T16:46:05,Tylertt,midnight
28-03-2018T16:46:05,MidnightBlue78,MARV!!!!!!:ptv-excited:
28-03-2018T16:46:06,SpazztasticKiwi,hi
28-03-2018T16:46:15,MidnightBlue78,hey peeps!!!
28-03-2018T16:46:19,BadFoMo,Yo.
28-03-2018T16:46:30,Bellhead,"Sup,"
28-03-2018T16:46:34,xonxt,so... is there some connection between Twokinds and the separation of two Koreas?
28-03-2018T16:46:42,Bgrmystr2,"Probably not, xon"
28-03-2018T16:46:43,xonxt,both have 'two' in them
28-03-2018T16:46:51,Bgrmystr2,coincidence confirmed.
28-03-2018T16:47:04,Bellhead,"Possibly. I'ds ay if there is, it's unintentional."
28-03-2018T16:47:31,Bgrmystr2,"though I guess by that logic.. ANYTHING that has to do with ""two"" is connected to twokinds"
28-03-2018T16:47:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I do need to say my dad was never actually sent to Desert Storm
28-03-2018T16:47:38,BadFoMo,"I'm sorry, I must Troll."
28-03-2018T16:47:49,Bgrmystr2,"no fomo, you don't have to xD"
28-03-2018T16:47:52,SpazztasticKiwi,They decided against sending his group
28-03-2018T16:48:05,Bellhead,"I also think it's funny that half the time, the lag in th chat is so bad, I can type my whole message before I see what I typed... Dang."
28-03-2018T16:48:10,xonxt,@Bgrmystr2 only if it's also connected to Korea..
28-03-2018T16:48:30,Bgrmystr2,"that's not how connections work, xon"
28-03-2018T16:48:34,BadFoMo,TwoKids and Squrrial & Hedghug crossover when?
28-03-2018T16:48:41,BadFoMo,*Twokinds
28-03-2018T16:48:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,twokids XD

28-03-2018T16:49:12,Bgrmystr2,tom's worst nightmare
28-03-2018T16:49:15,SpotTheLeopard,"Is that like the muppet babies, TK version?"
28-03-2018T16:49:17,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
28-03-2018T16:49:22,Bellhead,Wow.... I had forgotted how good Trace/Flora lineart is...
28-03-2018T16:49:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Twokinds Babies, making dreams come true"
28-03-2018T16:49:54,Vatruvius,I made it back.
28-03-2018T16:49:55,BadFoMo,My spelling sucks right now.
28-03-2018T16:50:05,Bellhead,Euchre is not amused.
28-03-2018T16:50:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,my spelling succs in general
28-03-2018T16:50:47,BadFoMo,Eucher: Their child must not be alloud to live.
28-03-2018T16:50:58,Bellhead,"I'm relying on sight, since I can't check my spelling untill I post it."
28-03-2018T16:51:44,BadFoMo,...That was the only good twist I could think of.
28-03-2018T16:51:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Eucher ""Rose I know you have my NES, I want it back"" Rose ""No its mine"""
28-03-2018T16:51:55,Twokinds,This is the last page of the chapter btw
28-03-2018T16:52:05,Tylertt,it is?!
28-03-2018T16:52:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,WooHoo \o/
28-03-2018T16:52:10,BadFoMo,Yep.
28-03-2018T16:52:29,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited:
28-03-2018T16:52:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Lets celebrate with a stream
28-03-2018T16:52:38,Bgrmystr2,I thought there was one more
28-03-2018T16:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,🙌🏻
28-03-2018T16:52:53,Bellhead,My bet's that Euchre has some life-altering severely important message to share.
28-03-2018T16:52:57,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock: Nice Tom! Chapter 20 here we come!:ptv-excited:
28-03-2018T16:53:37,Bellhead,"Is anyone seeing this lag, or is it just me?"
28-03-2018T16:53:46,Vatruvius,No lag over here.
28-03-2018T16:53:54,BadFoMo,"Any way, it was that, or ""I have seen the future, Flora will not live to see their child""."
28-03-2018T16:54:07,Bellhead,Must bee my ancient laptop and crummy wifi.
28-03-2018T16:54:26,Tylertt,nope there is some delay here
28-03-2018T16:54:29,Vatruvius,I would bet on the wifi before the computer.
28-03-2018T16:54:56,Bellhead,I wouldn't. It was designed for Vista when Vista was new. It's running 10.
28-03-2018T16:55:43,Bellhead,"I sshould bring in my desktop. IT has XP, at least."
28-03-2018T16:55:48,BadFoMo,I have around 13 seconds of a delay.
28-03-2018T16:56:09,Bellhead,"You mean between Stream and Chat, or chat alone?"
28-03-2018T16:56:12,BadFoMo,*15.
28-03-2018T16:56:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,7 seconds here
28-03-2018T16:56:30,BadFoMo,@Bellhead Stream and chat.
28-03-2018T16:56:50,Vatruvius,Is there not a delay built into the stream?
28-03-2018T16:57:14,Bgrmystr2,"Bellhead, Vista is fully capable of watching streams of this quality"
28-03-2018T16:57:17,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, XP was as well"
28-03-2018T16:57:19,Vatruvius,I have about a 10 second delay but no lag.
28-03-2018T16:57:31,Bellhead,"Huh... I have about that much lag between Tom's chat and mine, but at least 5 s between me typing and it showing up."
28-03-2018T16:57:45,Bgrmystr2,so unless the hardware is being bogged down by somethin g
28-03-2018T16:57:47,TheBeckoner,"I have no lag, or so little I cant tell"
28-03-2018T16:57:51,Bgrmystr2,then it's the connection
28-03-2018T16:57:54,Bigboi182,Ok I'm back.
28-03-2018T16:57:59,TheBeckoner,"Hi, Back"
28-03-2018T16:58:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb
28-03-2018T16:58:12,Bgrmystr2,welcome beck :p
28-03-2018T16:58:22,Vatruvius,WIPKING is back Bigboi! :ptv-dealwithit:
28-03-2018T16:58:28,Bgrmystr2,back ff :c
28-03-2018T16:58:33,TheBeckoner,heh
28-03-2018T16:58:36,TheBeckoner,got in ur head
28-03-2018T16:58:40,Bellhead,"Bgr, I'd bet that XP could handle it fine, its Work's online system that it can't run."
28-03-2018T16:58:40,Bgrmystr2,You did.
28-03-2018T16:58:44,Bgrmystr2,"I thought you came back, beck"
28-03-2018T16:58:51,Bigboi182,Oh dear...
28-03-2018T16:58:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,delayed smol bounce:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
28-03-2018T16:58:54,TheBeckoner,Well I was gone for a bit
28-03-2018T16:58:58,TheBeckoner,So not wrong
28-03-2018T16:59:12,Bigboi182,Wait... He's not here...
28-03-2018T16:59:14,Bgrmystr2,"then that's a network speed and/or connectivity failure, bell :/"
28-03-2018T16:59:22,Bigboi182,Did you just prank me?
28-03-2018T16:59:32,Vatruvius,Maybe...:ptv-snicker:
28-03-2018T16:59:55,Bellhead,"No, I ran XP with FF 28. NOTHING works for me on that, as far as streams go. I could try it though, I suppose."
28-03-2018T17:00:24,Bgrmystr2,Sounds like it's just a garbage setup
28-03-2018T17:00:28,TheBeckoner,Windows Xp was bad /t
28-03-2018T17:00:42,Bgrmystr2,I ran XP well into 2009 and could watch full 1080p streams with zero lag
28-03-2018T17:00:59,Bgrmystr2,"so that's definitely your setup, or your connection."
28-03-2018T17:01:07,Bgrmystr2,and this isn't even 1080p
28-03-2018T17:01:12,Vatruvius,It wouldn't be the OS...something with your hardware or internet is the problem.
28-03-2018T17:01:15,Bgrmystr2,"this is like 720p, I believe"
28-03-2018T17:01:18,TheBeckoner,I ran XP till like 11 or so then went to 7. Then got a new computer that had 8.1 (ew) Now on 10
28-03-2018T17:01:30,Bellhead,"In your mind, it probably was. But for $0, it was fast, lightweight, and did what I told it to."
28-03-2018T17:01:36,Bellhead,"Stream's not lagging for me, just the chat."
28-03-2018T17:01:54,Bgrmystr2,"Bell, I'm not an ordinary user, I'm a computer tech. Nothing was ""in my mind"""
28-03-2018T17:02:07,Bgrmystr2,maybe what you experience is in your mind. :P

28-03-2018T17:33:49,CanisRufusUK,"From the angle of thier heads while looking at each other I'd say rose is closer to us, so perspective will make her look a bit taller than she is."

28-03-2018T18:46:35,Bgrmystr2,"Of course not Vatru, but it's fun to accuse you of thus"
28-03-2018T18:46:41,Bigboi182,side with Vatruvius.
28-03-2018T18:46:41,Bgrmystr2,cuz you give good reactions
28-03-2018T18:46:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,specist then
28-03-2018T18:47:10,Bigboi182,That still wouldn't work....
28-03-2018T18:47:11,Vatruvius,ignores Marv's last comment.
28-03-2018T18:47:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Marvist -_-
28-03-2018T18:47:27,Dadrobit,Speciesism is trully running rampant
28-03-2018T18:47:27,Bgrmystr2,LOL
28-03-2018T18:47:28,Bigboi182,laughs.
28-03-2018T18:47:31,Bgrmystr2,Marvist
28-03-2018T18:47:35,Bgrmystr2,cofirmed
28-03-2018T18:47:39,Bigboi182,Very marvist.
28-03-2018T18:47:46,unsteddyphoenix,tearing us apart with this discrimination
28-03-2018T18:47:49,Vatruvius,face palms.
28-03-2018T18:48:05,Bigboi182,puts the word 'marvist' in the dictionary.
28-03-2018T18:48:29,Bgrmystr2,"and this is the problem, fomo"
28-03-2018T18:48:35,Bgrmystr2,see what you did
28-03-2018T18:48:43,Vatruvius,lol
28-03-2018T18:48:49,Bgrmystr2,it's all ruined
28-03-2018T18:48:57,Bigboi182,"Yeah, We're just gonna milk this until it's dry."
28-03-2018T18:49:02,Bigboi182,So... yeah.
28-03-2018T18:49:06,unsteddyphoenix,It's already dry
28-03-2018T18:49:13,unsteddyphoenix,I suspect youll go way beyond that
28-03-2018T18:49:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no more slurp slurp
28-03-2018T18:49:20,unsteddyphoenix,NICE one Fomo
28-03-2018T18:49:26,Bigboi182,How far can it go?
28-03-2018T18:49:28,Dadrobit,I hate it when the slup slurp ends
28-03-2018T18:49:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,3 inches
28-03-2018T18:49:34,SpazztasticKiwi,It was never producing milk to begin with
28-03-2018T18:49:41,CrimsonHelsing,Howdy! And OHHH holy shit I'm already excited looking at this page!! :D
28-03-2018T18:49:50,Bgrmystr2,"I highly suggest not doing so, cuz it tends to get really obnoxious really quick"
28-03-2018T18:49:51,BadFoMo,As far as the mods will let it.
28-03-2018T18:49:54,Bigboi182,And you're very late.
28-03-2018T18:49:58,Bgrmystr2,hey Crimson
28-03-2018T18:50:03,Dadrobit,o/ Crimson
28-03-2018T18:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Try to contain yourself
28-03-2018T18:50:09,Bigboi182,"There are no mods, fomo."
28-03-2018T18:50:10,CrimsonHelsing,Started early I assume. What's up?
28-03-2018T18:50:16,SpazztasticKiwi,😉
28-03-2018T18:50:17,Bgrmystr2,"what do you think Tom is, Big lol"
28-03-2018T18:50:33,Bigboi182,"An Admin, not a mod."
28-03-2018T18:50:40,Bgrmystr2,he is both
28-03-2018T18:50:44,Bigboi182,True.
28-03-2018T18:50:45,Bgrmystr2,xD
28-03-2018T18:50:53,SpazztasticKiwi,He can also mod as admin though
28-03-2018T18:50:53,Vatruvius,Tom is the ultimate mod
28-03-2018T18:50:54,Bigboi182,But mostly an admin.
28-03-2018T18:51:04,Bgrmystr2,of course he can kiwi
28-03-2018T18:51:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tom is gunma's down hill specialist
28-03-2018T18:51:15,BadFoMo,Someone with power then.
28-03-2018T18:51:20,Bigboi182,yeah.
28-03-2018T18:51:20,unsteddyphoenix,How shallow and pedantic
28-03-2018T18:51:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Unlimited power
28-03-2018T18:51:33,Bgrmystr2,"Unless he goes sideways, marv, no bueno."
28-03-2018T18:51:37,Dadrobit,unsteddy lowkey savage
28-03-2018T18:51:40,Bigboi182,But not quite godly.
28-03-2018T18:51:43,Bigboi182,Yet.
28-03-2018T18:51:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lowkey sausage
28-03-2018T18:51:54,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
28-03-2018T18:52:15,Bigboi182,"If Tom was in Smash, he'd be pretty broken."
28-03-2018T18:52:29,Bgrmystr2,He'd draw characters that would come to life and fight for him
28-03-2018T18:52:39,Bgrmystr2,probably :thinking:
28-03-2018T18:52:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Unbeatable boss
28-03-2018T18:52:41,Dadrobit,"Let's be honest, he'd never leave spawn"
28-03-2018T18:52:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,everyone is broken when they get smashed
28-03-2018T18:52:49,Bigboi182,"In fact, a lot of TK characters would be broken in smash."
28-03-2018T18:52:50,unsteddyphoenix,lmao dad knows
28-03-2018T18:53:01,Bgrmystr2,lol dadro is right
28-03-2018T18:53:09,Vatruvius,Tom would draw Adelaide...that is all.
28-03-2018T18:53:26,unsteddyphoenix,pls nerf
28-03-2018T18:53:28,Bgrmystr2,even she has her limits..
28-03-2018T18:53:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lies
28-03-2018T18:53:35,Bgrmystr2,though they're very far up there
28-03-2018T18:53:38,Vatruvius,Adelaide has no limits.
28-03-2018T18:53:43,Dadrobit,Magic yo
28-03-2018T18:53:49,Bgrmystr2,^
28-03-2018T18:53:52,TheBeckoner,Mind limit tho
28-03-2018T18:54:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the angrier she gets the stronger her boobs become
28-03-2018T18:54:02,TheBeckoner,Dont wann get poo brain
28-03-2018T18:54:07,TheBeckoner,wanna*
28-03-2018T18:54:09,Bigboi182,It would go like this for the roster:
28-03-2018T18:54:10,Bgrmystr2,marv wat XD
28-03-2018T18:54:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it “Adele-aid” or “Ad-a-laid”?
28-03-2018T18:54:13,unsteddyphoenix,"If she can do things indistinguishable from magic, can you really say she has no magic"
28-03-2018T18:54:14,Combak,"... Man, chat's gone to shit."
28-03-2018T18:54:23,TheBeckoner,Naaaahhhhh
28-03-2018T18:54:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the source of the power
28-03-2018T18:54:32,TheBeckoner,Boob force
28-03-2018T18:54:33,qwe304,its like lemonade
28-03-2018T18:54:40,Bgrmystr2,"Combak, you say that almost every single time"
28-03-2018T18:54:44,Bigboi182,Trace would essentially be mario.
28-03-2018T18:54:51,Dadrobit,He's not wrong tho
28-03-2018T18:54:51,Bgrmystr2,"and no matter how many times you say it, it's still normal."
28-03-2018T18:55:12,Bigboi182,Keith would be like a slightly worse Marth.
28-03-2018T18:55:15,Dadrobit,Combak that is.
28-03-2018T18:55:22,Vatruvius,Think of a better comeback Comback!
28-03-2018T18:55:25,Bgrmystr2,is he not?
28-03-2018T18:55:33,Bgrmystr2,cuz the chat's been the same since it started lol
28-03-2018T18:55:37,Dadrobit,"The fuck are you on big, Trace is Mega Man."
28-03-2018T18:55:53,Bgrmystr2,don't think it's gotten any worse or bette
28-03-2018T18:55:56,Vatruvius,We have already established Trace being very powerful.
28-03-2018T18:55:56,Bgrmystr2,better*
28-03-2018T18:56:02,Bigboi182,"But Trace would be a balanced character, like Mario."
28-03-2018T18:56:15,Vatruvius,Trace is not balanced.
28-03-2018T18:56:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kirby
28-03-2018T18:56:25,Dadrobit,Trace is OP as shit
28-03-2018T18:56:27,Bigboi182,"Flora.... Hm, not sure."
28-03-2018T18:56:38,Bigboi182,But he can't touch tom.
28-03-2018T18:56:44,TheBeckoner,Keith would be balanced Id think
28-03-2018T18:56:47,Vatruvius,Flora controls Trace...making her super powerful Flora.
28-03-2018T18:56:52,Bgrmystr2,I'm just gonna sit over here and watch.
28-03-2018T18:56:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,is trace balanced for lean
28-03-2018T18:56:59,Bigboi182,I guess flora would be Diddy Kong?
28-03-2018T18:57:07,qwe304,tbh rose is becoming a more developed character than kat
28-03-2018T18:57:10,Bigboi182,Not sure.
28-03-2018T18:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,grabs popcorn
28-03-2018T18:57:16,Dadrobit,"(I haven't played a Smash since Brawl, so I'm out honestly)"
28-03-2018T18:57:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats not hard qwe
28-03-2018T18:57:26,Vatruvius,takes Kiwi's popcorn.
28-03-2018T18:57:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah rose has been in like, 10 pages now?"
28-03-2018T18:57:31,unsteddyphoenix,Out of the water
28-03-2018T18:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,made plenty for all the audience
28-03-2018T18:57:58,MuonNeutrino,"well, rose was in... 3 flashback pages, a number of pages in TDM, and ... a good 10 or so this chapter maybe?"
28-03-2018T18:58:00,Bigboi182,burns the popcorn
28-03-2018T18:58:08,Bigboi182,Because I can.
28-03-2018T18:58:10,MuonNeutrino,maybe more
28-03-2018T18:58:26,Vatruvius,starts to sell excess popcorn to make a few bucks.
28-03-2018T18:58:26,unsteddyphoenix,So what youre saying is Kat needs her own sidecomic.
28-03-2018T18:58:27,Bigboi182,makes better popcorn
28-03-2018T18:58:27,SpotTheLeopard,*returns from noms*

28-03-2018T18:58:41,MuonNeutrino,"no, obviously *Rose* needs her own side comic =P"
28-03-2018T18:58:41,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
28-03-2018T18:58:43,MuonNeutrino,"anotehr one, that is =P"
28-03-2018T18:58:43,TheBeckoner,wn Spot

28-03-2018T18:59:00,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix I can go for that.
28-03-2018T18:59:01,Bigboi182,watches on
28-03-2018T18:59:04,Dadrobit,So you're saying that Kat is best served as a side show unsteddy?
28-03-2018T18:59:07,SpotTheLeopard,"thanks Marv, Beck"
28-03-2018T18:59:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Kat, best served with clothes"
28-03-2018T18:59:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Right now, maybe."
28-03-2018T18:59:33,MuonNeutrino,"man, cannot wait to see the dialogue"
28-03-2018T18:59:42,Bigboi182,"Hah, 69 users."
28-03-2018T18:59:42,BadFoMo,"Although, I thing Tam and Phill are working on something like that."
28-03-2018T18:59:51,Bgrmystr2,expecting shit to hit the fan next chapter.
28-03-2018T18:59:51,TheBeckoner,Without you mean?
28-03-2018T18:59:51,Bigboi182,I'm so childish.
28-03-2018T18:59:52,unsteddyphoenix,If shes gonna keep getting *[excluded] like this~
28-03-2018T18:59:56,MuonNeutrino,"kat, best served with whatever the heck she feels like because it'd be awesome regardless ^^"
28-03-2018T18:59:59,Bgrmystr2,xD Phoenix
28-03-2018T19:00:05,TheBeckoner,One day I'll figre out the bubble thing
28-03-2018T19:00:12,Bgrmystr2,unhappy about Kat not being there
28-03-2018T19:00:15,BadFoMo,*Tom
28-03-2018T19:00:17,Bigboi182,One more thing to the list.
28-03-2018T19:00:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sorry unsteddy but the important characters need their screen time
28-03-2018T19:00:26,Vatruvius,"Kat can only really develop further if she gets Eric or gets over him, she is kinda stuck right now. A history of here does not seem like it would be a pleasant one."
28-03-2018T19:00:34,BadFoMo,...*and Phil
28-03-2018T19:00:44,qwe304,"14 pages, not counting this"
28-03-2018T19:00:44,MuonNeutrino,"i'm sure Kat will show back up soon enough, this half of the chapter was just more about getting group B there is all"
28-03-2018T19:00:44,unsteddyphoenix,Yes more Karen please. No im fine. This is fine.
28-03-2018T19:00:48,Dadrobit,"Kat just needs too hook up with Keiren, perfect ship."
28-03-2018T19:00:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
28-03-2018T19:00:55,Bigboi182,"Yeah, her relationship with Eric is hindering her."
28-03-2018T19:01:02,Bgrmystr2,Dadro really xD
28-03-2018T19:01:05,Bigboi182,Not sure Dad.
28-03-2018T19:01:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Lets push it dad
28-03-2018T19:01:12,Dadrobit,It's actually amazing
28-03-2018T19:01:20,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
28-03-2018T19:01:21,BadFoMo,I'll say it again; I suck at spelling.
28-03-2018T19:01:23,unsteddyphoenix,Explain the logic though

28-03-2018T19:02:38,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 yeah, but at least with never-met pairings like kat/zen there's *some* rationale behind it XD"
28-03-2018T19:02:52,Bigboi182,Maybe when Zen wakes up and stumbles upon Kat...
28-03-2018T19:02:54,Twokinds,Done

28-03-2018T19:22:55,CrimsonHelsing,*That* Cat in the Hat
28-03-2018T19:23:17,MarshallMelon,I take it you aren't aware of the Cory in the House = anime meme then
28-03-2018T19:23:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so uncivilized
28-03-2018T19:23:32,CrimsonHelsing,... okay you're joking around calling it an anime. Okay. I'll drop it.
28-03-2018T19:23:41,Bgrmystr2,that meme is stupid though
28-03-2018T19:23:43,Bgrmystr2,a meme it is
28-03-2018T19:23:48,MarshallMelon,It has its moments
28-03-2018T19:23:49,Bgrmystr2,but fucking dumb.
28-03-2018T19:24:07,Bigboi182,"Come on, Will smith actually made superheroes really funny."
28-03-2018T19:24:08,MarshallMelon,Depends on how its used really
28-03-2018T19:24:09,unsteddyphoenix,Nah it's good.
28-03-2018T19:24:14,Bigboi182,It had
28-03-2018T19:24:17,MarshallMelon,"But yeah, it's a bit saturated now"
28-03-2018T19:24:21,CrimsonHelsing,"Either you be picking with me Marsh, or you seriously don't know what I'm talking about at all xD"
28-03-2018T19:24:31,CrimsonHelsing,*dicking with me
28-03-2018T19:24:32,Bigboi182,"""Move Bitch"" was in the movie!"
28-03-2018T19:24:32,unsteddyphoenix,Dont pick with him!
28-03-2018T19:24:34,MarshallMelon,"I do, Crim. I was trying to be funny."
28-03-2018T19:24:39,Bigboi182,Come on now.
28-03-2018T19:24:49,MarshallMelon,Also egads I ain't dickin' wit' u. I don't swing that way.
28-03-2018T19:24:56,Bigboi182,Someone back me up here!
28-03-2018T19:24:59,CrimsonHelsing,xD
28-03-2018T19:25:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its not gay if he hit back
28-03-2018T19:25:09,SpotTheLeopard,*trying to think of other parodies post-90's* I liked Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle
28-03-2018T19:25:36,Bigboi182,At least Ghost rider was pretty good...
28-03-2018T19:25:48,unsteddyphoenix,shaolin showdown was a good anime
28-03-2018T19:26:02,MarshallMelon,On a certain level you could argue that Deadpool was a parody. Even though it's completely faithful to the source material.
28-03-2018T19:26:32,unsteddyphoenix,Deadpools existence is a parody
28-03-2018T19:26:35,unsteddyphoenix,I'll allow it
28-03-2018T19:26:47,Bigboi182,He made it look good though...
28-03-2018T19:26:56,MarshallMelon,"Given that he started out as a parody of Deathstroke, that's probably true"
28-03-2018T19:27:02,CrimsonHelsing,"Deadpool I'll hand it to him, he's hilarious"
28-03-2018T19:27:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,deadpool committed mass murder because someone spoiled harry potter for him
28-03-2018T19:27:10,CrimsonHelsing,And he's everywhere
28-03-2018T19:27:34,MarshallMelon,He straight up capped a dude 'cause he preferred the Star Wars prequels
28-03-2018T19:28:04,CrimsonHelsing,Hey what's wrong with that? xD I love the prequels as much as the original trilogy!
28-03-2018T19:28:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,deadpool is the meme that can't ever die
28-03-2018T19:28:32,unsteddyphoenix,You read that comic where he becomes completely meta aware and murders every marvel superhero?
28-03-2018T19:28:40,Bigboi182,"Any Star wars fanboy would beat the snot out of you if you said that, Crimson..."
28-03-2018T19:28:46,Dadrobit,"I can relate to the Harry Potter one. Had a kid in school wear a shirt that read ""Dumbledore dies on page XXX"" the day after the book came out."
28-03-2018T19:28:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I have that comic unsteddy, its amazing"
28-03-2018T19:29:07,CrimsonHelsing,"Seriously love the prequels. And I know Star Wars fans, so go ahead and say that xD"
28-03-2018T19:29:08,unsteddyphoenix,Nice~
28-03-2018T19:29:20,Bigboi182,Just sayin...
28-03-2018T19:29:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Word dad, someone spoiled sirius black dies for me"
28-03-2018T19:29:36,unsteddyphoenix,Dude skipped to the end just to ruin it
28-03-2018T19:29:52,unsteddyphoenix,Childhood trauma
28-03-2018T19:29:53,BadFoMo,Cat: Dumbledore dies. Now feed me.
28-03-2018T19:30:00,CrimsonHelsing,Ohhh man xD spoiler shirt? That's a big nono
28-03-2018T19:30:10,Bgrmystr2,"and you're being any different right now.. how, phoenix?"
28-03-2018T19:30:28,Bgrmystr2,"or dadro, for that matter lol"
28-03-2018T19:30:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Because it's been 15 years, probably"
28-03-2018T19:30:29,Dadrobit,"Yup, literally scarred for life."
28-03-2018T19:30:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Instead of, the day after."
28-03-2018T19:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,Bgr I cant believe I needed to explain that cmon man
28-03-2018T19:30:56,MviluUatusun,"Well, I missed the stream.  What did Tom work on tonight?"
28-03-2018T19:31:01,unsteddyphoenix,Use some critical thinking
28-03-2018T19:31:11,MarshallMelon,"The next page, Mvilu"
28-03-2018T19:31:28,MarshallMelon,Likely means he's doing that one really old Nora Card tomorrow
28-03-2018T19:31:43,Bgrmystr2,"I am using critical thinking. I'm thinking that not everyone is going to be privy to the fact that Harry Potter existed immediately when it existed, and they also won't all be there to have read it when it ended."
28-03-2018T19:31:49,Bgrmystr2,"But I guess we can ignore that, yes?"
28-03-2018T19:31:51,MviluUatusun,"Oh, good.  I had to go to Maundy Thursday services at my church tonight.  My mom wanted to have Seder dinner."
28-03-2018T19:31:52,Bigboi182,"A comic, Uatusun"
28-03-2018T19:32:08,unsteddyphoenix,I can ignore that silly reasoning yes
28-03-2018T19:32:15,Dadrobit,Same
28-03-2018T19:32:21,MviluUatusun,"Thanks, Big."
28-03-2018T19:32:50,Bgrmystr2,"Grats, neither of you have any concept that people are not omniscient :)"
28-03-2018T19:33:03,Dadrobit,"For real though, 13-15 years later and we still remember that crap. Actually traumatizing."
28-03-2018T19:33:03,Bgrmystr2,Guess I'm the only one then
28-03-2018T19:33:48,unsteddyphoenix,My childhood. Ruined.
28-03-2018T19:33:49,Bgrmystr2,"It has been a while, I can give you that, but honestly, not everyone will be there."
28-03-2018T19:34:06,Bgrmystr2,I'm still catching up to anime I haven't watched for over a decade.
28-03-2018T19:34:07,Dadrobit,"I mean, between the books and the movies, knowing a few character deaths is akin to knowing Darth Vader is Luke's father."
28-03-2018T19:34:21,unsteddyphoenix,HES WHAT
28-03-2018T19:34:24,Dadrobit,You can't escape it.
28-03-2018T19:34:37,unsteddyphoenix,PEOPLE ARENT OMNISICENT DAD HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT
28-03-2018T19:34:38,Bgrmystr2,But nope. I guess everyone is actually omniscient according to phoenix and dadro. :V
28-03-2018T19:34:41,MarshallMelon,Next you'll be telling us Leia's his sister. What poppycock that would be!
28-03-2018T19:34:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Darth vader is Rosebuds sled
28-03-2018T19:34:44,Bigboi182,That's been known for 30 years bro...
28-03-2018T19:34:54,MarshallMelon,"Whoosh, Big"
28-03-2018T19:35:06,MviluUatusun,"No one would believe it, Marshall."
28-03-2018T19:35:06,Bigboi182,"Where have you been, unsteddy?"
28-03-2018T19:35:14,Bgrmystr2,Big missed the point entirely
28-03-2018T19:35:15,unsteddyphoenix,"What do you mean, jesus DIES. People arent omiscient!!"
28-03-2018T19:35:27,MarshallMelon,I gotta admit I kind of missed this banter
28-03-2018T19:35:27,Bgrmystr2,xD
28-03-2018T19:35:41,Bigboi182,I've been good at missing spoilers myself...
28-03-2018T19:35:43,Bgrmystr2,"you say that phoenix, but do you really get it? :P"
28-03-2018T19:35:50,unsteddyphoenix,Bgr I see the error of my ways im REELING from this SPOILERS
28-03-2018T19:36:06,Bgrmystr2,"yeah yeah, take your sarcasm and hike it lol"
28-03-2018T19:36:21,Bigboi182,I still don't know what happens in Star Wars Episode 8...
28-03-2018T19:36:24,Bgrmystr2,gotta buy a new detector thanks to you
28-03-2018T19:36:30,MarshallMelon,"Not much, honestly Big"
28-03-2018T19:36:33,Bgrmystr2,just replaced that last week
28-03-2018T19:36:41,MarshallMelon,"Well, a couple of big things, but aside from them"
28-03-2018T19:37:07,Dadrobit,Fun Fact! The Sorcer's Stone was released closer to A New Hope than New Hope is to us today!
28-03-2018T19:37:11,Bigboi182,Let me guess: something something Luke Skywalker?
28-03-2018T19:37:20,MarshallMelon,Something something yes
28-03-2018T19:37:21,Dadrobit,The Philosopher's Stone *
28-03-2018T19:37:26,unsteddyphoenix,Oof
28-03-2018T19:37:29,Bigboi182,Same Thing!
28-03-2018T19:37:56,Dadrobit,Than Philosoper's Stone is to us today* I mean
28-03-2018T19:37:56,Bgrmystr2,soo.. is Harry's sister now a dog or something?
28-03-2018T19:38:01,MarshallMelon,I can believe that. HP books predated the movies by a while
28-03-2018T19:38:02,Bigboi182,And something something space fight?
28-03-2018T19:38:28,Bigboi182,You guys do realize that J.k Rowling made an EIGHTH book right?
28-03-2018T19:38:33,Bgrmystr2,"something something not interesting, Big"
28-03-2018T19:38:37,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeaaah
28-03-2018T19:38:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Harry potter is British dragon ball
28-03-2018T19:38:42,Dadrobit,"In fact, there's only 14 years between Return of the Jedi and the first book. The book was released 21 years ago."
28-03-2018T19:38:49,Bigboi182,Something something why?
28-03-2018T19:39:00,Bgrmystr2,you're doin it wrong ^
28-03-2018T19:39:02,MarshallMelon,"It's kind of a big circular plot, Big"
28-03-2018T19:39:12,Bigboi182,How big?
28-03-2018T19:39:14,Dadrobit,The Philosopher's Stone can legally drink.
28-03-2018T19:39:25,MarshallMelon,"Big things happen in the middle, but in the end the plot's in the same place"
28-03-2018T19:39:39,Bigboi182,So it's the same thing?
28-03-2018T19:39:43,Bgrmystr2,"I saw the original star wars movies when I was young, before they released the first prequel in theatres"
28-03-2018T19:39:44,MarshallMelon,Pretty much
28-03-2018T19:39:53,Bgrmystr2,"I was a kid, so all I liked was the cool wooshy lasers and stuff"
28-03-2018T19:39:56,Dadrobit,"And with that being said, Professor Quirrel is hiding Voldemort on the back of his head."
28-03-2018T19:39:59,Bgrmystr2,but everything else was boring
28-03-2018T19:40:02,Bgrmystr2,so meh

28-03-2018T19:41:12,unsteddyphoenix,It's only 21 years old you think you can just talk about it like that?
28-03-2018T19:41:12,Bgrmystr2,"I literally had more reason to like Star Wars than Star trek, and Star wars was pretty boring already so"
28-03-2018T19:41:15,Bgrmystr2,I dunno
28-03-2018T19:41:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Me big

28-03-2018T19:41:33,MarshallMelon,Not my thing
28-03-2018T19:41:36,unsteddyphoenix,If you count those as people
28-03-2018T19:41:49,MarshallMelon,And as a Brit I believe that makes me an enemy to my own state
28-03-2018T19:42:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"saw 2 of the movies was like 'Nope"""

28-03-2018T19:46:45,Ordithus,I should get home from work earlier
28-03-2018T19:46:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just move to a better time zone
28-03-2018T19:46:52,unsteddyphoenix,These streams might help fix my sleep schedule if this keeps up

28-03-2018T19:48:00,MarshallMelon,"Heh, these streams DESTROYED my sleep schedule. I'm still recovering"
28-03-2018T19:48:06,unsteddyphoenix,just not a convenient one lol
28-03-2018T19:48:09,unsteddyphoenix,ay good man
28-03-2018T19:48:33,MarshallMelon,One of the reasons I keep going AWOL. Doing this too much doesn't do me any good
28-03-2018T19:49:25,unsteddyphoenix,THe Struggle :/
28-03-2018T19:51:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t worry. Tom’s shot my sleep regularity too
28-03-2018T19:51:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it pays being only 3 hours behind :)
28-03-2018T19:52:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Toms set to improve my sleep schedule, so it balances out"
28-03-2018T19:52:13,Bigboi182,He's done that to me for 6 Months Spazz..
28-03-2018T19:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom what do you have to say for yourself
28-03-2018T19:53:02,Ordithus,It's Sage streaming until 2am on the Friday streams that does me in.
28-03-2018T19:53:07,Bgrmystr2,"lol, I like how you guys had your schedule destroyed by watching the streams.. Am I like.. the only one who had this schedule before the stream existed?"
28-03-2018T19:53:10,Bgrmystr2,like..
28-03-2018T19:53:14,Bgrmystr2,I don't.. even
28-03-2018T19:53:15,unsteddyphoenix,He does do that
28-03-2018T19:53:49,MarshallMelon,"To put it in perspective a normal stream (say, Friday) would start either at 2:30 or 1:30AM depending on GMT/DST."
28-03-2018T19:53:54,Ordithus,"If Tom can consistently stream as early as today, I might get in to work at a reasonable time so I can see it"
28-03-2018T19:54:12,unsteddyphoenix,Oof
28-03-2018T19:54:14,Dadrobit,"So I'm looking for terrible parodies, and I may have found the worst one...."
28-03-2018T19:54:23,MarshallMelon,"The only ones that are manageable for me are the Sunday ones, and I avoid those as best I can"

28-03-2018T20:41:50,TheBeckoner,that*
28-03-2018T20:41:56,BadFoMo,"A little late, I know."
28-03-2018T20:42:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Considering how advanced the tech is, probably not"
28-03-2018T20:42:20,unsteddyphoenix,Magic hinders all technological advancement
28-03-2018T20:42:43,WIPKING,we will be way past mars in 2858 A.d
28-03-2018T20:42:59,WIPKING,"i did the math guys if 1 month in the comic is 7 years in real life than 1 year in the comci is 84 years in real life thus, if flora only lives for 10 more years the comic will end in 840 years in 2858 a.d"
28-03-2018T20:43:01,Ordithus,"Magic usually supplants technology, in most high magic settings"
28-03-2018T20:43:10,Bgrmystr2,"Wip, your math is already wrong to begin with"
28-03-2018T20:43:13,WIPKING,"1 month in the comic is 7 years in real life than 1 year in the comci is 84 years in real life thus, if flora only lives for 10 more years the comic will end in 840 years in 2858 a.d"
28-03-2018T20:43:15,Bgrmystr2,so stop
28-03-2018T20:43:16,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
28-03-2018T20:43:20,qwe304,the comic's time fluctuates
28-03-2018T20:43:34,WIPKING,by minutes
28-03-2018T20:43:39,BadFoMo,Tom busted the math. Sorry.
28-03-2018T20:43:46,WIPKING,no he did not
28-03-2018T20:43:49,Bellhead,"Welp, if BGR is still here, I can safely say to you that the cause was only partially shoddy WIFI, as I am home and the chat is no longer lagging as badly, but there is still a bit of lag anytime anyone posts."
28-03-2018T20:44:12,unsteddyphoenix,Bgr lets just ignore him
28-03-2018T20:44:16,Bgrmystr2,lol bell
28-03-2018T20:44:48,Bellhead,Gotta get the Dimension out of the closet and throw some coal in it. See if XP still fires up.
28-03-2018T20:45:01,Bgrmystr2,xD gl
28-03-2018T20:45:20,Ordithus,Dimension?  Is this some old Dell or HP model?
28-03-2018T20:45:22,WIPKING,"srry tom but you and your ""side writers"" are slow"
28-03-2018T20:45:40,Bgrmystr2,"The Dell Dimension is a series, Ord"

28-03-2018T20:46:00,Ordithus,"OK, thanks.  Now I know~"
28-03-2018T20:46:01,Bgrmystr2,it's a series of prebuilt towers
28-03-2018T20:46:02,TheBeckoner,best idea

28-03-2018T20:47:05,Ordithus,I would think so
28-03-2018T20:47:09,Bgrmystr2,I had a dell Vista tower.. it was trash till I got rid of all the garbage vista ran with
28-03-2018T20:47:15,Bgrmystr2,"then it was STILL garbage, but not as bad"
28-03-2018T20:47:23,Bellhead,"And judging by my newer computer's performance, it's more the fault of the programs than the processor."
28-03-2018T20:47:46,WIPKING,k well you guys are too old to uderstand anyways BYE!

28-03-2018T20:48:19,TheBeckoner,I am not old...
28-03-2018T20:48:23,Bgrmystr2,He's right. I'm too old to understand young people's stupidity

28-03-2018T20:50:30,Bigboi182,Please tell me you didn't...

28-03-2018T20:52:56,Bigboi182,"Wait, how do i start a whisper chat?"
28-03-2018T20:52:57,TheBeckoner,Yeah but its happening now lol

28-03-2018T20:53:27,unsteddyphoenix,Would recommend
28-03-2018T20:53:30,TheBeckoner,pretty good shit
28-03-2018T20:53:40,Bellhead,How mute?
28-03-2018T20:53:51,TheBeckoner,Ah good idea Phoenix.
28-03-2018T20:53:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,🦖
28-03-2018T20:53:56,Bgrmystr2,"No, I guess you're right phoenix. I clearly have no free will of my own and do not make my own decisions to do something despite whether others are trying to bait or not."
28-03-2018T20:53:57,Ordithus,"""/ignore"" and then the name"
28-03-2018T20:53:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Tap the name you want to whisper. “/w” should show in your text box
28-03-2018T20:54:03,Bigboi182,So nobody knows how to start a whisper chat?
28-03-2018T20:54:13,WIPKING,no
28-03-2018T20:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s how I do it anyway
28-03-2018T20:54:17,Bigboi182,never mind.
28-03-2018T20:54:25,Bgrmystr2,"click their name, big"
28-03-2018T20:54:29,WIPKING,but imma make a new account so bye
28-03-2018T20:54:42,WIPKING,i was anly here for the stream that i missed
28-03-2018T20:54:54,Bellhead,Dang. I ignored him just barely too late.
28-03-2018T20:55:24,WIPKING,this is like a roblox server
28-03-2018T20:56:12,qwe304,"you can aslo chick their pfp and itl show some options, including ignoring"
28-03-2018T20:56:35,Bellhead,"Anyway, as I was saying before I forgot to... Running old programs on a machine built for new ones will run slower than an old machine, but will run new ones just fine. An old machine will naturally run new programs slower than a new machine."
28-03-2018T20:57:03,Bgrmystr2,That's.. not always the case
28-03-2018T20:57:07,Bgrmystr2,the former is not accurate
28-03-2018T20:57:09,Ordithus,"It really depends on the software, for the old program on the new machine."
28-03-2018T20:57:12,Bgrmystr2,"the latter is, generally"
28-03-2018T20:57:15,Ordithus,Usually it runs faster.
28-03-2018T20:57:18,Bgrmystr2,but depends a lot
28-03-2018T20:57:22,Twokinds,I just realized I forgot to note that Euchre and Rose are speaking Keidran on the previous page.
28-03-2018T20:57:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh oh
28-03-2018T20:57:32,Bellhead,"But, a new machine designed for old programs, ie single core processor, will run old programs dumb well."
28-03-2018T20:57:41,Twokinds,Ah well
28-03-2018T20:57:46,Ordithus,"But Flight Simulator X was made late in the single-cpu era, expecting higher clock rates"
28-03-2018T20:57:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Tiny issue. Easy fix
28-03-2018T20:57:49,Twokinds,It doesn't really matter
28-03-2018T20:57:52,Ordithus,It's still garbage on a new computer
28-03-2018T20:58:04,Bgrmystr2,Welll... you /should/ prolly go and fix that xD
28-03-2018T20:58:05,unsteddyphoenix,No my language brackets!
28-03-2018T20:58:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Nobody knows you made a mistake unless you mention it
28-03-2018T20:58:32,SpazztasticKiwi,😄
28-03-2018T20:58:43,Ordithus,"They are both fluent in human anyways, right?"
28-03-2018T20:58:45,unsteddyphoenix,If only mistakes worked like that...
28-03-2018T20:58:47,Bellhead,"Yeah, because it was designed for higher single-core processing speeds, whereas newer ones multitask better. It's a trade-off."
28-03-2018T20:59:04,Bgrmystr2,"Cores are more complicated than that, Bell"
28-03-2018T20:59:05,Bigboi182,"Honestly, what does keidran sound like to humans?"
28-03-2018T20:59:21,unsteddyphoenix,Chinese
28-03-2018T20:59:25,Ordithus,Latin but growly
28-03-2018T20:59:25,Twokinds,Yeah they both speak human of course
28-03-2018T20:59:35,Twokinds,French
28-03-2018T20:59:48,TheBeckoner,I was gonna say french lol
28-03-2018T20:59:49,WIPKING,you guys are mean.
28-03-2018T20:59:51,Ordithus,Keidran just got sexier
28-03-2018T20:59:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty language. How are ya today Tom?
28-03-2018T20:59:52,Bigboi182,"Cool, I can communicate with them!"
28-03-2018T21:00:01,Bigboi182,And Basitin speak?
28-03-2018T21:00:04,Bellhead,"Are they? In all honesty, my Pentium D outperforms my Centrino in ALL my old programs, and is on par with the I3 I had for a while."
28-03-2018T21:00:10,Bigboi182,It's probably dutch.
28-03-2018T21:00:10,Twokinds,Except Raine who's Canadian.
28-03-2018T21:00:16,unsteddyphoenix,Well obviously.
28-03-2018T21:00:17,Ordithus,lol
28-03-2018T21:00:19,WIPKING,im just sitting here
28-03-2018T21:00:19,unsteddyphoenix,Goes without saying
28-03-2018T21:00:23,WIPKING,being ignored
28-03-2018T21:00:24,SpazztasticKiwi,So she’s super nice?
28-03-2018T21:00:26,TheGamePlayer,so Tom ever have your Vive lose video but still have audio?
28-03-2018T21:00:27,Bigboi182,True Tom
28-03-2018T21:00:37,WIPKING,because im 20 years younger
28-03-2018T21:00:37,Twokinds,I already answered that!
28-03-2018T21:00:44,Twokinds,You asked during the stream
28-03-2018T21:00:49,TheGamePlayer,oh
28-03-2018T21:00:58,TheGamePlayer,i didnt see that
28-03-2018T21:00:59,Twokinds,The answer was ytes.
28-03-2018T21:01:00,WIPKING,:ptv-angry:
28-03-2018T21:01:16,TheGamePlayer,ah ok any way to fix it?
28-03-2018T21:01:16,unsteddyphoenix,Id think youd be very used to answering repeat questions
28-03-2018T21:01:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ytes? you people and your gamer speak
28-03-2018T21:01:24,Twokinds,"Oh and also Rose, who's country"
28-03-2018T21:01:28,Twokinds,Although she tries to hide it
28-03-2018T21:01:33,unsteddyphoenix,She speaks bumpkin?
28-03-2018T21:01:43,MarshallMelon,"How tall is Rose then, if Euchre's 6'7?"
28-03-2018T21:01:47,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s not nice 😜
28-03-2018T21:01:51,WIPKING,who can hear me
28-03-2018T21:01:57,Twokinds,Yo Mashall
28-03-2018T21:02:03,Bigboi182,So basitins speak Dutch then?
28-03-2018T21:02:04,unsteddyphoenix,Is he? Big lad...
28-03-2018T21:02:05,MarshallMelon,Hey Tom
28-03-2018T21:02:05,Twokinds,I don't have an official Rose height
28-03-2018T21:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see you WIP
28-03-2018T21:02:10,Bigboi182,Or something...
28-03-2018T21:02:11,WIPKING,:ptv-angry:
28-03-2018T21:02:17,Bgrmystr2,She's about one Rose tall.
28-03-2018T21:02:19,Bgrmystr2,likely.
28-03-2018T21:02:23,MarshallMelon,"She looks to be around 6'1, assuming Euchre's accurate"
28-03-2018T21:02:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"is Euchre really tall, or is Rose really short?"
28-03-2018T21:02:31,MarshallMelon,Eyeballing was never my strength
28-03-2018T21:02:33,Ordithus,Yes
28-03-2018T21:02:40,WIPKING,can you tell all the people who blocked me that they are mean
28-03-2018T21:02:41,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’ll block you too if you keep up that attitude
28-03-2018T21:02:43,Twokinds,"Probably around Raine's height? I usually just give characters general, relative heights"
28-03-2018T21:02:54,Twokinds,Medium height women are people like Raine and Rose
28-03-2018T21:02:59,MarshallMelon,Literally relative in this case
28-03-2018T21:03:03,Bigboi182,Ah. Makes sense.
28-03-2018T21:03:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"I will tell them no such thing, WIP"
28-03-2018T21:03:11,unsteddyphoenix,\o/ hooray we're medium~

28-03-2018T21:03:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ok, the most important question of all, Is Euchre the biggest wolf?"
28-03-2018T21:03:27,WIPKING,"flora is 5, 4"
28-03-2018T21:03:29,Bigboi182,"Yeah, like that'll work WIP..."
28-03-2018T21:03:31,WIPKING,btw
28-03-2018T21:03:33,unsteddyphoenix,But average heights differ on race though?
28-03-2018T21:03:36,MarshallMelon,"And then you've got HUEG, which is reserved for Adelaide"
28-03-2018T21:03:46,Bigboi182,"Maddie is young though, so..."
28-03-2018T21:03:51,WIPKING,it will work
28-03-2018T21:03:51,Ordithus,Laura was kinda short too
28-03-2018T21:04:03,Bigboi182,"It won't,trust me."
28-03-2018T21:04:04,WIPKING,you guys will never know who i am
28-03-2018T21:04:06,Twokinds,"Well, obviously, but I mean outside the comic lore"
28-03-2018T21:04:16,Bigboi182,We streamers know who's who.
28-03-2018T21:04:27,unsteddyphoenix,I see.
28-03-2018T21:04:30,Bigboi182,no matter if you change your name or not.
28-03-2018T21:04:31,MarshallMelon,"Welp, so much for my Height Chart 3 idea"
28-03-2018T21:04:42,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
28-03-2018T21:04:43,MarshallMelon,Need to go more seasonal for this one anyway
28-03-2018T21:05:09,unsteddyphoenix,What are some race-average heights?
28-03-2018T21:05:14,Twokinds,"If Maddie and Flora are next to each other, I'll draw Flora taller, if Flora's next to Raine, Raine's taller, if Raine's next to Natani, Natani is taller."
28-03-2018T21:05:23,Bigboi182,"So, anyone hyped for Nibbly as the easter bunny?"
28-03-2018T21:05:37,MarshallMelon,"Bit of a low-hanging fruit suggestion, isn't it?"
28-03-2018T21:05:47,Bigboi182,The option's there.
28-03-2018T21:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I think we’ll figure it out. Different name doesn’t equal anonymity if you’re attitude doesn’t change
28-03-2018T21:05:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Obligatory, one might say"
28-03-2018T21:05:52,Twokinds,"Humans, like in a lot of fantasy settings, are average"
28-03-2018T21:05:56,Bigboi182,Why not take it.
28-03-2018T21:06:10,Bigboi182,Humans may be at best 5'11.
28-03-2018T21:06:12,unsteddyphoenix,"average being like, 5'9-5'11?"
28-03-2018T21:06:12,Twokinds,"Wolves are tall, tigers are stocky, Basitins are short and lean"

28-03-2018T21:08:09,Bigboi182,That is basically a more elaborate version of my suggestion.
28-03-2018T21:08:09,MarshallMelon,My tired brain interpreted widdle as griddle and jeez that was a horrifying picture
28-03-2018T21:08:17,Bigboi182,And I like it.
28-03-2018T21:08:44,SpazztasticKiwi,The cuteness of Nibs alone is magical
28-03-2018T21:08:46,Bigboi182,"Another easy suggestion is an Easter Egg Hunt, TK style!"

28-03-2018T21:08:58,lol13yearold27,yep
28-03-2018T21:09:00,MarshallMelon,"The trick is not to tell us, dingus"

28-03-2018T21:09:19,unsteddyphoenix,Does picarto IP ban?
28-03-2018T21:09:21,TheBeckoner,What a dumb
28-03-2018T21:09:24,MarshallMelon,It's possible
28-03-2018T21:09:25,TheBeckoner,told us and all
28-03-2018T21:09:29,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: I love how escalating this is
28-03-2018T21:09:33,Bgrmystr2,just watching
28-03-2018T21:09:35,Bgrmystr2,I should get popcorn

28-03-2018T21:09:36,MarshallMelon,"There's an automated security system, but it's easy to fool if you know how"
28-03-2018T21:09:36,Bigboi182,Ikr?
28-03-2018T21:09:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if you email them with screenshots unsteddy
28-03-2018T21:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Marshall I have a facemask on I’m not supposed to smile. :ptv-laugh:
28-03-2018T21:09:49,Bgrmystr2,"You can make two accounts, you're allowed to"
28-03-2018T21:09:52,unsteddyphoenix,Shit but then i'd have to unmute him
28-03-2018T21:09:53,Bgrmystr2,by Picarto ToS
28-03-2018T21:09:56,unsteddyphoenix,Not worth
28-03-2018T21:10:06,ZRO4825,Any more than that though and they find it ban worthy~
28-03-2018T21:10:09,lol13yearold27,ill just make oen and not tell plu i followed tom anyways
28-03-2018T21:10:21,Bigboi182,I believe the easter egg hunt would have Maddie and Maeve in cute dresses searching for eggs.
28-03-2018T21:10:25,ZRO4825,I imagine they allow two accounts in order for streamers to have one for streaming and one for blending in
28-03-2018T21:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Awww
28-03-2018T21:10:32,Bigboi182,It would be pretty nice.
28-03-2018T21:10:33,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, Zro, most likely"
28-03-2018T21:10:40,unsteddyphoenix,Maddie Maeve adventures pretty cute~
28-03-2018T21:10:45,Ordithus,Could also be so peeps can separate SFW and NSFW
28-03-2018T21:10:53,Bgrmystr2,"also possible, Ord"
28-03-2018T21:10:58,MarshallMelon,Picarto logs the IP of each user. Go over three accounts and it targets you
28-03-2018T21:10:59,ZRO4825,"For those that wanna do that, aye"
28-03-2018T21:11:04,ZRO4825,"Also, yes to Maeve please &lt;3"
28-03-2018T21:11:08,Bigboi182,Good. Now suggest it FOR me.
28-03-2018T21:11:15,Bgrmystr2,"they won't really do anything unless it's a problem though, Marshall."
28-03-2018T21:11:18,Bgrmystr2,From what I've seen
28-03-2018T21:11:23,Bigboi182,Cause I'm poor and also not a patron.
28-03-2018T21:11:38,MarshallMelon,"True, although it is technically automated. It runs checks and if you fail, bam."
28-03-2018T21:11:40,Bigboi182,Mostly poor...
28-03-2018T21:11:55,Bgrmystr2,It's not likely to be an automated ban system
28-03-2018T21:12:05,Bgrmystr2,I doubt that's a thing
28-03-2018T21:12:06,MarshallMelon,Seemed that way when I was looking into it
28-03-2018T21:12:18,MarshallMelon,Although that was over a year ago now
28-03-2018T21:12:26,Ordithus,"Pneumatic Ban Hammer, the latest innovation"
28-03-2018T21:12:26,Bigboi182,"Funny thing that happened: The first time i got banned, it legit banned my whole ISP."
28-03-2018T21:12:36,Bgrmystr2,"based on what I've seen on the chats, lots of ppl have several accounts, but nothing happens"
28-03-2018T21:12:48,qwe304,is that against ToS?
28-03-2018T21:12:51,Bgrmystr2,gotta go out of your way to report em before somethin happens
28-03-2018T21:12:54,MarshallMelon,Yes
28-03-2018T21:12:55,Bigboi182,I couldn't log on from the ISP i'm currently using...
28-03-2018T21:12:57,qwe304,oh
28-03-2018T21:13:01,Bgrmystr2,"3 or more accounts, Qwe yes"
28-03-2018T21:13:08,qwe304,i have two alts but never use em
28-03-2018T21:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I only have the one. Don’t see a need for more
28-03-2018T21:13:15,Bgrmystr2,"just change your external IP, Big"
28-03-2018T21:13:19,MarshallMelon,I ran an experiment and once had quite a few running at the same time. I wanted to see if I could bypass the system.
28-03-2018T21:13:26,Bigboi182,That's too much for me.
28-03-2018T21:13:28,MarshallMelon,It worked right up until it overheated my PC
28-03-2018T21:13:35,Ordithus,:fire:
28-03-2018T21:13:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh oh
28-03-2018T21:13:47,Bgrmystr2,it's really easy tho big
28-03-2018T21:13:49,Bigboi182,"I honestly didn't mind too much, cause I deserved it."
28-03-2018T21:13:49,Bgrmystr2,:/
28-03-2018T21:13:55,Bgrmystr2,but okay
28-03-2018T21:14:04,MarshallMelon,Or run a VPN. Tons of free ones out there.
28-03-2018T21:14:18,Bgrmystr2,VPN is more complicated than changing an external IP
28-03-2018T21:14:29,MarshallMelon,With some it's just clicking a button
28-03-2018T21:14:38,TheBeckoner,Gotta get a good VPN too
28-03-2018T21:14:44,Bgrmystr2,You have to set all that shit up manually though
28-03-2018T21:14:55,Bigboi182,"Then I checked one day, suddenly I can see the chat, so the glitch probably was fixed."
28-03-2018T21:14:57,Bgrmystr2,and understand how it works
28-03-2018T21:15:26,Bgrmystr2,changing ip is literally just creating some new numbers and clicking save
28-03-2018T21:15:31,Bigboi182,"I think if I put up the banned account, the whole thing will start up again..."
28-03-2018T21:15:47,Bgrmystr2,"well, then don't. and leave it as is"
28-03-2018T21:16:14,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I think bans are too easy to navigate around anyway :/"
28-03-2018T21:16:20,Bigboi182,That's why i'm NOT using Carlitob1010 anymore.
28-03-2018T21:16:25,Bgrmystr2,They should be based on mac address.
28-03-2018T21:16:32,Bigboi182,Are they?
28-03-2018T21:16:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gonna marathon the Jurassic park movies see ya guys laters :ptv-hearts:
28-03-2018T21:16:58,Bigboi182,See ya Marv!
28-03-2018T21:16:59,Bgrmystr2,"yeah bans are usually based on external IP, which you can change manually, at any time, Big"
28-03-2018T21:17:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun!
28-03-2018T21:17:01,qwe304,i dont think websites get your mac adress

28-03-2018T21:17:15,Bigboi182,I noticed.
28-03-2018T21:17:23,TheBeckoner,Bai Marvu
28-03-2018T21:17:37,Bgrmystr2,"they'd need to go through your ISP, which means any VPN is useless"
28-03-2018T21:17:45,BadFoMo,Bye.
28-03-2018T21:17:53,Bgrmystr2,"if they mac ban you, you're done."
28-03-2018T21:18:00,Bgrmystr2,need a new network connection.
28-03-2018T21:18:06,Ordithus,"MACs can be spoofed, too"
28-03-2018T21:18:27,BadFoMo,MACs?
28-03-2018T21:18:31,Dadrobit,Back.
28-03-2018T21:18:33,Bgrmystr2,"physical cards, not so much"

28-03-2018T21:18:56,Bgrmystr2,external IP is all digital
28-03-2018T21:18:56,Dadrobit,Very tasty
28-03-2018T21:18:58,Ordithus,"wb roit, sounds tasty"
28-03-2018T21:19:03,Bgrmystr2,"easy to spoof, easy to bypass"
28-03-2018T21:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds good
28-03-2018T21:19:08,Bgrmystr2,macs are physical
28-03-2018T21:19:19,Ordithus,My router can change its upstream MAC address
28-03-2018T21:19:44,Bgrmystr2,that's not the mac address I'm talking about
28-03-2018T21:19:53,qwe304,"you can easily mask your mac adress, even from your own router"
28-03-2018T21:20:00,Ordithus,"I think it is, bgr"
28-03-2018T21:20:11,Bgrmystr2,"No, cuz your router is not your pc, ord :P"
28-03-2018T21:20:24,Bgrmystr2,"and if you did that qwe, it wouldn't connect at all"
28-03-2018T21:20:27,Bgrmystr2,that's how thet communicate
28-03-2018T21:20:55,Ordithus,"MACs are mostly used for the initial handshake and DHCP, to set the IP address"
28-03-2018T21:21:17,Bgrmystr2,a mac isn't like an IP. It is a physical code that is different for every single device
28-03-2018T21:21:19,Ordithus,"I've changed the router's MAC and connected back, and it gives a new IP doing that"
28-03-2018T21:21:35,qwe304,yo can change it easily if you arent on windows
28-03-2018T21:21:58,Bgrmystr2,my network card on my motherboard has a mac address. It's a physical address given to it by hardware
28-03-2018T21:22:01,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't go anywhere
28-03-2018T21:22:14,Bgrmystr2,it can't be changed
28-03-2018T21:22:32,Bgrmystr2,"what it looks like can be spoofed, but what it IS cannot be changed"

28-03-2018T21:27:32,Dadrobit,"Nonononono. Cats listen, they listen purrrrfectly. They just then proceed to ignore everything."
28-03-2018T21:27:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Trust me.  I've had many cats over the years.  Dadrobit took the words out of my mouth.
28-03-2018T21:27:55,unsteddyphoenix,If they didnt listen how could they efficiently do the opposite of what you want?
28-03-2018T21:27:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ll ask Bagheera if he’s cute, and he mews"
28-03-2018T21:28:16,Bgrmystr2,"Palm, I literally cannot"

28-03-2018T21:29:04,TheBeckoner,I'm gonna go eat and shower. See ya'll later.
28-03-2018T21:29:13,TheBeckoner,at the same time of course
28-03-2018T21:29:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay. So you're basing your opinion on me based on when I was experiencing violent mood swings caused by my meds?
28-03-2018T21:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t fall in
28-03-2018T21:29:20,Ordithus,"See ya, Beck and Big"
28-03-2018T21:29:36,Twokinds,Holly is single-handedly the reason the comic updates have been slow for 9 years.
28-03-2018T21:29:44,Twokinds,XD
28-03-2018T21:29:45,Ordithus,Sure she is
28-03-2018T21:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Shame
28-03-2018T21:29:51,unsteddyphoenix,Cats are also very good at absorbing blame
28-03-2018T21:29:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
28-03-2018T21:30:01,Twokinds,"If it weren't for Holly, we'd be on page 2000 right now."
28-03-2018T21:30:08,Twokinds,And the baby would be just years away.
28-03-2018T21:30:14,Dadrobit,Ayyyy
28-03-2018T21:30:15,Bgrmystr2,xD
28-03-2018T21:30:15,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
28-03-2018T21:30:17,SpazztasticKiwi,So cute you gotta pet
28-03-2018T21:30:27,qwe304,how many cats do you have? just one?
28-03-2018T21:30:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
28-03-2018T21:30:34,unsteddyphoenix,But then Holly would have to exist somewhere outside your room
28-03-2018T21:30:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,Trust me.  Cats will always demand you give them attention
28-03-2018T21:30:40,unsteddyphoenix,A reality too cruel for me
28-03-2018T21:30:43,Twokinds,That's true
28-03-2018T21:30:51,Twokinds,I can't imagine Holly anywhere else.
28-03-2018T21:31:11,unsteddyphoenix,What a dark timeline that would be
28-03-2018T21:31:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,Which is one reason why we love them.  Makes you wonder who is the true pet when it comes to cats
28-03-2018T21:31:36,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what cats do - passive aggressively move into your heart
28-03-2018T21:31:40,qwe304,is keenspot still draging their feet with preorders?
28-03-2018T21:31:45,Ordithus,It's a love/love relationship

28-03-2018T21:34:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,Cats are always trying to get your attention.
28-03-2018T21:34:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Unsteddy there would be many hungry people
28-03-2018T21:35:03,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
28-03-2018T21:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I was trying to get dressed to go somewhere one day and Bagheera was reaching up and pawing at me to be picked up

28-03-2018T21:36:22,unsteddyphoenix,I need more happy kat emotes to react to all this cat talk lately
28-03-2018T21:36:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,I remember when the South had that ice storm a few years back that hardly anyone had power. Luckily McDonalds still had power so everyone went there to eat
28-03-2018T21:36:36,SpazztasticKiwi,“No leave. Pet me.”

28-03-2018T21:37:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,I remember when Ling Ling would jump on my windowsill and scare the living daylights out of me.
28-03-2018T21:37:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"And McDonald’s employees can’t call in sick without a hospital/dr.’s excuse, vomiting, or fever"

28-03-2018T21:37:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Also our cat Boo likes to push our dog Deedee down the stairs or trip her up.  Or tip her over.
28-03-2018T21:37:48,unsteddyphoenix,https://imgur.com/gallery/q46L4QH
28-03-2018T21:38:04,Ordithus,haha
28-03-2018T21:38:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think that is Boo's way saying you're my friend to Deedee.
28-03-2018T21:38:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,But I'm not sure.  Lol
28-03-2018T21:39:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Possibly. Bagheera randomly baps at me sometimes
28-03-2018T21:39:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,My sister said when we found Boo she's so ugly she's cute.  She's a calico.  And we found her in our backyard on Halloween.
28-03-2018T21:39:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Cats: they say I love you by slapping you or trying to kill you
28-03-2018T21:40:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or bite your entire hand off!
28-03-2018T21:40:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Calico catto
28-03-2018T21:40:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I have one too
28-03-2018T21:40:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or steal your car keys
28-03-2018T21:40:58,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom’s cat steals bras
28-03-2018T21:40:59,ZRO4825,"You people need to learn how to deal with cats then, lol. I've never had those problems with mine or anyone else's."
28-03-2018T21:41:29,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah my cat never did that :thinking:
28-03-2018T21:41:35,unsteddyphoenix,She vented all her aggression on the couch
28-03-2018T21:42:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera was walking on the edge of my bed this morning wanting attention
28-03-2018T21:42:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,Boo did that once.  Dropped my keys and bam!  She grabbed my keys with her mouth.  Was able to get my keys back thanks to a squeaky mouse.
28-03-2018T21:43:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"and as he was leaning into the head scratch, he fell off the bed face first"
28-03-2018T21:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"I grabbed him, but he yelled at me for it"
28-03-2018T21:43:39,SpazztasticKiwi,The thanks I get for saving him a face plant
28-03-2018T21:45:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,@ZRO4825 so what problems have you had with your cats?
28-03-2018T21:45:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,Same with you Unsteddy?
28-03-2018T21:45:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Did offering food distract Holly, Tom?"
28-03-2018T21:45:56,ZRO4825,"None that I didn't deserve, lol"
28-03-2018T21:46:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,Such as. Laughs a bit
28-03-2018T21:46:33,ZRO4825,"Cats are like people, they ignore people who irritate them, and if that doesn't work, THEN they scratch the shit out of them."
28-03-2018T21:46:50,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
28-03-2018T21:47:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,True words.  True words ZRO
28-03-2018T21:47:07,ZRO4825,"I mean, not quite like people. People now days run into someone they don't like they just block them because ""You're being mean"" or something like that, without even considering where the other person might be coming from. :thinking:"
28-03-2018T21:47:35,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
28-03-2018T21:47:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah that happens a lot nowadays
28-03-2018T21:47:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Unfortunately
28-03-2018T21:47:56,unsteddyphoenix,"In summary, stop being mean to cats :T"
28-03-2018T21:48:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,And other people
28-03-2018T21:48:07,ZRO4825,"That it does Palm, that it does...."
28-03-2018T21:48:11,unsteddyphoenix,no just cats
28-03-2018T21:48:13,unsteddyphoenix,You nerd
28-03-2018T21:48:26,ZRO4825,I'm okay with being mean to people. Most of the ones that I end up being mean to did something to deserve it.
28-03-2018T21:48:52,ZRO4825,"And most of the time instead of figuring out they did something to deserve it, they keep being an idiot and assuming they're right anyway."
28-03-2018T21:49:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,My grandfather taught me if you use salt not many people are going to like you.  If you use sugar on the other hand many people will like.  Even those who don't like you.  One day they might become your friends
28-03-2018T21:50:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,May my grandfather rest in peace
28-03-2018T21:52:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,Of course I've seen people try to mother wild cats like lions and clouded leopards and tigers!  I mean that's cool and all but those people are brave to raise an animal that could kill you even as babies!
28-03-2018T21:52:50,ZRO4825,"If a baby cat manages to kill you, you needed to get up off  your ass and use your arms. They're not THAT dangerous as babies."
28-03-2018T21:53:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,So you would be willing to raise tiger or a lion cub?
28-03-2018T21:53:34,unsteddyphoenix,Fun fact in Dnd a cat is more likely to kill a human peasant than the other way around
28-03-2018T21:53:37,ZRO4825,"From its infancy? Yeah, wouldn't be a problem. Except the cost of feeding it."
28-03-2018T21:53:52,Ordithus,"Lap tiger, ouch"
28-03-2018T21:54:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's true ZRO.  And unsteddy how does that happen?!
28-03-2018T21:54:30,ZRO4825,That's because a peasant is the weakest thing known to exist in D&D Phoenix. :P
28-03-2018T21:54:31,SpazztasticKiwi,You get to tell it to get off the counter
28-03-2018T21:54:36,Ordithus,"I think a cheetah would be pretty chill, they're usually pretty docile, I think."
28-03-2018T21:55:04,unsteddyphoenix,Basically cats have such high DEX that a peasent would probably miss so much that it'd eventually die to scratches.
28-03-2018T21:55:06,ZRO4825,"Cheetahs if raised with a human family actually make pretty decent pets from what I've seen in videos, but that being said, only the rich could afford it."
28-03-2018T21:55:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,I thought goblins were the weakest things in D&D.
28-03-2018T21:55:28,ZRO4825,"Weakest thing you'll typically fight, maybe"
28-03-2018T21:55:34,ZRO4825,Unless you piss off the townsfolk :P
28-03-2018T21:56:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,And those who aren't afraid of being stalked by animal rights activists ZRO.
28-03-2018T21:57:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,One person did ask a GM was it possible for his paladin to raise a baby black dragon and make it good.   I mean you don't see what happens to the monster babies in some D&D games.
28-03-2018T21:58:08,Ordithus,"I'm going to go, see you later!"
28-03-2018T21:58:16,BadFoMo,Bye.
28-03-2018T21:58:21,unsteddyphoenix,seeya
28-03-2018T21:58:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,Have a goodnight!
28-03-2018T21:59:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,I mean usually black dragons are evil but if raised by a paladin of Pelor maybe a black dragon could be a force of good and righteousness.  Right?
28-03-2018T22:00:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or am I stretching here?
28-03-2018T22:02:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well I best get to bed as well.  Have to be at work at 9 am and I have an hour drive to get there.
28-03-2018T22:03:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,Y'all have a wonderful night!  And Tom try not to get too scratched up by your cat!
28-03-2018T22:08:55,Dadrobit,Back. Dipping in and out of homework.
28-03-2018T22:09:33,ElvenHunter84,Is it saying that you're banned from the stream for anyone else?
28-03-2018T22:10:32,Dadrobit,"Naw, only ever got banned on the forums, not here just yet."
28-03-2018T22:10:46,unsteddyphoenix,Youve been banned on the FORUMS?
28-03-2018T22:11:03,ElvenHunter84,And/or was i online in the last few days and said anything that would get me banned?
28-03-2018T22:11:06,unsteddyphoenix,Thats impressive
28-03-2018T22:11:23,Dadrobit,"Wait, no, just got a ban warning."
28-03-2018T22:11:33,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh. For what?
28-03-2018T22:11:38,Dadrobit,"Was in a heated ""debate"" with a Commie."
28-03-2018T22:12:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, had to defend 'murica, I gotcha."
28-03-2018T22:12:20,Dadrobit,Damned skippy.

28-03-2018T22:20:11,Dadrobit,"Actually, the Commie I was arguing with brought something like that up. Essentially anyone making more than a soldier is a terrible person."
28-03-2018T22:20:56,unsteddyphoenix,Aha
28-03-2018T22:21:15,Dadrobit,He went on to lowkey Godwin's Law me by comparing me to Ajiit Pai.
28-03-2018T22:21:25,unsteddyphoenix,Everyone should just get exactly what they create! Karl Marx was a genius!
28-03-2018T22:21:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe they thought you were to inactive than abandoned your account

28-03-2018T22:24:05,Vatruvius,...why are we talking about communism?

28-03-2018T22:31:05,Vatruvius,I mean...through the patreon Tom makes more than minimum wage but just above that.
28-03-2018T22:31:39,Vatruvius,I cannot imagine the expense of keeping his tablet and looking glass.
28-03-2018T22:31:43,unsteddyphoenix,prolly gets a lot for keenspot ads
28-03-2018T22:31:55,Vatruvius,By no means is Tom making bank.
28-03-2018T22:32:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Nah he probably does pretty well, not really the point though."
28-03-2018T22:32:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t make a habit of discussing the funds of others
28-03-2018T22:32:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I ran the numbers at the time and he makes a whopping 7% more than the average person's salary in Cincinnati from Patreon."
28-03-2018T22:32:35,unsteddyphoenix,He was living off his comic before patreon
28-03-2018T22:33:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Whatever he does make though, he deserves"
28-03-2018T22:33:06,Dadrobit,"Coincidentally, that is right on par with, and potentially less than a career soldier of the same level of experience."
28-03-2018T22:33:07,Vatruvius,Yeah...I think Tom is doing pretty good. He managed to sustain himself doing something he loves. A professor of mine said if you can manage that...you do not need anything else.
28-03-2018T22:34:11,Dadrobit,"I'm absolutely in favor of making fat stacks. If people are paying, then the price is right."
28-03-2018T22:35:16,Vatruvius,Tom would make fat stacks if he let more than 4 Nora Cards...but if he did that then every sketch would become a masterpiece so...
28-03-2018T22:35:34,Vatruvius,RIP Tom's life.
28-03-2018T22:35:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He can’t be too good. Then the government would steal him
28-03-2018T22:35:51,Vatruvius,He would have no free time or anything.
28-03-2018T22:35:56,SpazztasticKiwi,😄

28-03-2018T22:36:37,unsteddyphoenix,Seems pretty clear people would pay
28-03-2018T22:36:45,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre always full atm
28-03-2018T22:37:14,Vatruvius,I would love to pay for just one...but I would have to find something to warrant that kind of donation.
28-03-2018T22:37:37,Vatruvius,I will probably wait until I find the thing I want done then save up for just that one.
28-03-2018T22:40:29,unsteddyphoenix,sounds about right
28-03-2018T22:40:54,Dadrobit,https://www.patreon.com/posts/basitin-dinner-14518866
28-03-2018T22:40:58,Dadrobit,Just sayin'
28-03-2018T22:41:02,Dadrobit,It's an option
28-03-2018T22:41:05,unsteddyphoenix,I probably shouldnt take one considering im pretty lucky with my requests already~
28-03-2018T22:41:36,unsteddyphoenix,I love that secret nibbly so much lol
28-03-2018T22:41:53,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's a big part of why I haven't taken one."
28-03-2018T22:42:26,unsteddyphoenix,Remember when Trace had aquarium legs that was a good time~
28-03-2018T22:42:36,Dadrobit,I think I'm pretty up there with success rates among patreons.
28-03-2018T22:43:01,Dadrobit,He's do well on a ship
28-03-2018T22:43:02,unsteddyphoenix,Even considering your 6 month hiatus on that sketch?
28-03-2018T22:43:06,unsteddyphoenix,or however long it was
28-03-2018T22:43:09,Dadrobit,He's already got his Sea Legs
28-03-2018T22:43:17,Dadrobit,"7 months, yeah."
28-03-2018T22:43:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Shit, that is the best joke that ever came too late"
28-03-2018T22:43:56,Dadrobit,Before that I had won almost every month for at least a sketch.
28-03-2018T22:44:15,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh fair.
28-03-2018T22:44:15,Vatruvius,Wow...that is really cool Dadrobit. But...it does say older Maddie so...confirmed she is actually young in the comic?
28-03-2018T22:44:25,unsteddyphoenix,!! True!
28-03-2018T22:44:27,Dadrobit,And then there was the time I got two sketches in one for Christmas
28-03-2018T22:44:35,unsteddyphoenix,Thats why dad HAD to make her legal~
28-03-2018T22:44:45,Dadrobit,Lol
28-03-2018T22:45:17,Vatruvius,Dadrobit...did you make Keith a father?
28-03-2018T22:45:17,Dadrobit,All I know for sure is that Lynn is the father.
28-03-2018T22:45:30,Dadrobit,I did in fact make him a dad.
28-03-2018T22:45:45,Dadrobit,"Also, poor timing on that question/statement."
28-03-2018T22:45:45,Vatruvius,Lynn is Maddie's father?
28-03-2018T22:45:48,unsteddyphoenix,My man Lynn is eunic you must see the truth
28-03-2018T22:46:05,Dadrobit,Lynn is definitely Maddie's father.
28-03-2018T22:46:17,Vatruvius,How old is Lynn?
28-03-2018T22:46:25,Dadrobit,Old enough?
28-03-2018T22:46:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Should just sketch request ""Maddies father"" and see what happens"
28-03-2018T22:46:44,Vatruvius,Nothing will happen if it is a spoiler.
28-03-2018T22:46:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I could see Tom doing some convenient censorship on the face
28-03-2018T22:47:09,unsteddyphoenix,Would be very surprised if he was relevant and never came out this whole time
28-03-2018T22:47:12,Vatruvius,But...perhaps Lynn does not want Keith to go with Natani because he knows Maddie...his daughter...like him?
28-03-2018T22:47:14,unsteddyphoenix,"I guess it's possible, but."
28-03-2018T22:47:22,Dadrobit,Or it would be a fairly nondescript basitin scribbled by Maddie in crayon.
28-03-2018T22:47:36,Vatruvius,lol
28-03-2018T22:47:36,unsteddyphoenix,Tom if you read this please confirm if Maddies daddie is a spoiler and whether youd be willing to draw him
28-03-2018T22:47:38,Vatruvius,He would.
28-03-2018T22:47:48,unsteddyphoenix,"d'aw, that sounds alright actually"
28-03-2018T22:47:58,Dadrobit,It would be a spoiler just to confirm that it's a spoiler tho
28-03-2018T22:48:26,unsteddyphoenix,"True, but i'll allow it."
28-03-2018T22:48:41,unsteddyphoenix,PM me the answer for safety then I wont tell them~
28-03-2018T22:48:53,Vatruvius,I just have to some up with a really good idea. Why was that sketch in circuit for so long Dadrobit...backlog of good ideas?
28-03-2018T22:49:21,Dadrobit,Because people sperged out at the idea that Natani was dead.
28-03-2018T22:49:23,Vatruvius,No one will trust you unsteddy...or anyone for that matter on the internet. Not unless you hand over nude photos.
28-03-2018T22:49:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats why it's perfect, I couldnt tell anyone even if I wanted to"
28-03-2018T22:49:49,unsteddyphoenix,Unspoilable!
28-03-2018T22:49:54,Vatruvius,What? This is all before me so what about Natani being dead?
28-03-2018T22:49:54,Dadrobit,Maddie is so much older in that sketch because it's after Natani's time was done.
28-03-2018T22:50:11,Vatruvius,Ohh...
28-03-2018T22:50:14,Vatruvius,I get what you mean.
28-03-2018T22:50:18,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah he originally wanted Natanis corpse hanging upside down above them
28-03-2018T22:50:26,unsteddyphoenix,THen everyone got mad at him
28-03-2018T22:50:27,Vatruvius,lol
28-03-2018T22:50:39,Dadrobit,Lol no.
28-03-2018T22:50:57,Vatruvius,"Maddie, ""Dinner is served."""
28-03-2018T22:51:13,Dadrobit,Originally it was them having dinner by a fireplace that had an urn on it draped with Natani's crystal necklace.
28-03-2018T22:51:34,Dadrobit,Hence the necklace around the keidran plush in the final sketch.
28-03-2018T22:51:40,Vatruvius,"That is really sweet, no Laura urn? Or was this so far back that had not happened yet?"
28-03-2018T22:52:12,Dadrobit,I didn't mention the urn as I figured it was going to be left with the Fox Tribe.
28-03-2018T22:52:25,Vatruvius,Makes sense.
28-03-2018T22:52:32,Dadrobit,"But Natani's home is with Keith, so that's where it would stay."
28-03-2018T22:53:11,Vatruvius,Yeah...I need to come up with a really cool idea like that. I have had some but they are just ramblings. Kinda like how it takes a good few days before you narrow down your thesis on you essay.
28-03-2018T22:53:16,unsteddyphoenix,Wasnt there an urn edit
28-03-2018T22:54:10,Dadrobit,"""Rip Natani, He never scored"""
28-03-2018T22:55:32,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
28-03-2018T22:56:30,unsteddyphoenix,I still have like 5000 ideas so.
28-03-2018T22:57:29,Dadrobit,Coulda' sworn I saved a screencap of that. Can't find it now.
28-03-2018T22:57:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Screenshots exist, dunno where I saw it though"
28-03-2018T22:58:12,Vatruvius,"If you were to donate enough to get a Nora Card Dadrobit, would you do that sketch?"
28-03-2018T22:58:53,Dadrobit,"Probably, it's one of the only one's that I've gotten that didn't get colored."
28-03-2018T22:59:26,Vatruvius,It seems too sweet to not get colored...at some point.
28-03-2018T22:59:41,Vatruvius,I never even knew about it until you linked it to me.
28-03-2018T23:00:05,Vatruvius,Well...not to me but linked it.
28-03-2018T23:00:11,unsteddyphoenix,"When it eventually got drawn it was so satisfying, even for me."
28-03-2018T23:00:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I tried to go to sleep but this question keeps on nagging at me.  Tom: why do you prefer Picarto and not Twitch?
28-03-2018T23:00:29,Dadrobit,Literally the best feeling.
28-03-2018T23:00:41,Vatruvius,Twitch would not allow this content would it?
28-03-2018T23:01:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well Tom does clean art.  So I don't see why they wouldn't.  I mean I have an artist friend who drew anthros with skimpy clothing on.
28-03-2018T23:01:26,unsteddyphoenix,Why would he change?
28-03-2018T23:01:30,Vatruvius,Plus...my user experience here on Picarto is better then on Twitch...just saying.
28-03-2018T23:01:36,unsteddyphoenix,Same\
28-03-2018T23:01:42,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s no direct nudity. Though he’d still run a chance of being flagged/reported
28-03-2018T23:01:47,unsteddyphoenix,10x the annoying kids
28-03-2018T23:01:55,Dadrobit,Found it!
28-03-2018T23:02:03,Vatruvius,Plus...a troll would come in and flag it for sure.
28-03-2018T23:02:12,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/ZkXuPYf.png
28-03-2018T23:02:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm not saying he should change I'm just curious why he didn't use Twitch from the start that's all.  Well there are trolls here too.  Aren't there?
28-03-2018T23:02:24,unsteddyphoenix,Hahhaa
28-03-2018T23:02:43,Vatruvius,"What is with the ""he never scored"" bit?"
28-03-2018T23:02:57,unsteddyphoenix,The answer is definitely because Sage recommended picarto
28-03-2018T23:03:01,unsteddyphoenix,So talk to him
28-03-2018T23:03:14,Vatruvius,Yeah...but I do not think Tom would be at risk for getting flagged here on Picarto...so a simple ban is all that is needed.
28-03-2018T23:03:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hmm.....you might be onto something unsteddy.  As usual.
28-03-2018T23:03:35,Vatruvius,That too...Tom's friends were using Picarto...so stream together.
28-03-2018T23:04:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,Makes sense.  I mean if my friends were streaming on picarto why would I stream on something else
28-03-2018T23:04:37,Vatruvius,Yup...plus there are some really nasty poeple/trolls on Twitch that just make their rounds.
28-03-2018T23:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Twitch has some strict modders though too
28-03-2018T23:05:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh gosh!  That's true.  I saw a bunch on a game developers stream a while back.   Indeed they do.  Very strict modders
28-03-2018T23:05:32,Vatruvius,I am sure...but I like the community here.
28-03-2018T23:05:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"No links, no caps, no long messages"
28-03-2018T23:05:57,unsteddyphoenix,Suppose you need those rules when the chat is that full
28-03-2018T23:05:57,Dadrobit,"Also, my slide lecture fucked up. Somehow she wrote some of the text mirrored. https://i.imgur.com/JGvBp1L.jpg"
28-03-2018T23:06:00,SpazztasticKiwi,No repeating messages either
28-03-2018T23:06:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,That is true Spazz.  I forgot about those features.
28-03-2018T23:06:18,unsteddyphoenix,lmao thats really weird
28-03-2018T23:06:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Btw, is anyone else hating all of this pollen?  It's been murder on my allergies."
28-03-2018T23:07:07,SpazztasticKiwi,It says “license to use song”
28-03-2018T23:07:24,Dadrobit,Always and forever. Used to get shots every week to help me with my allergies.
28-03-2018T23:07:28,Vatruvius,I do not get allergies so...pollen is okay.
28-03-2018T23:07:32,SpazztasticKiwi,My car was yellow the other day.
28-03-2018T23:07:44,SpazztasticKiwi,It was bought dark green
28-03-2018T23:08:01,Vatruvius,That is a lot of pollen.
28-03-2018T23:08:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,Same here Dadrobit.  Used to take shots but my insurance stopped covering them so I had to quit.
28-03-2018T23:08:32,Dadrobit,"Mine was yellow the other day. It was bought yellow though, so I'm pretty sure it's a different scenario."
28-03-2018T23:08:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,My mom asked me to wash her car soon.
28-03-2018T23:09:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,Ah it seems I forgot to take my contacts out before going to bed.  Must be more tired than I thought.   Of course I have to take melatonin supplements to help me sleep so there's that.
28-03-2018T23:09:44,Vatruvius,lol
28-03-2018T23:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Why? It just gets dirty again
28-03-2018T23:09:57,Dadrobit,0.o She did it again on the next slide! Where's the QA team here?
28-03-2018T23:10:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you need a translator for the mirrored stuff?
28-03-2018T23:11:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I sleep in my contacts more than I should
28-03-2018T23:11:16,Dadrobit,"If you leave certain caustic substances on your car like bird crap, it'll eat away at your paint and then it'll NEVER look good."
28-03-2018T23:11:32,Vatruvius,Literally just get a small mirror...perfect translator.
28-03-2018T23:11:51,Dadrobit,"Naw, I can read it just fine. It's just odd that it happened in the first.... and second place."
28-03-2018T23:12:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I live on a dirt road if I wash my car whenever it got dirty that’d be every day
28-03-2018T23:13:16,Dadrobit,I try to go in every couple months.
28-03-2018T23:16:14,Vatruvius,Hmm...I am really drawing blanks for cool sketch ideas. Like...really nice ideas.
28-03-2018T23:17:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly rave
28-03-2018T23:17:18,Vatruvius,Problem is...I have a feeling I will come up with an idea and it has been suggested before/done before and I was just not there to see it.
28-03-2018T23:17:23,unsteddyphoenix,:saxophone::ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
28-03-2018T23:17:34,Vatruvius,Mrs. Nibbly playing the Sa
28-03-2018T23:17:50,unsteddyphoenix,Well just look at every sketch~
28-03-2018T23:17:57,Vatruvius,Nice...one just hit me.
28-03-2018T23:18:19,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like daddy and I probably know most of the sketches between us
28-03-2018T23:18:22,Vatruvius,there are over 300 sketches just on Tom's patreon
28-03-2018T23:18:24,Dadrobit,Tom not knowing how to correctly draw a saxaphone inbound.
28-03-2018T23:18:49,Dadrobit,Unsteddy is most probably correct.
28-03-2018T23:18:57,Vatruvius,Mark problem owns one...he can use it to model.
28-03-2018T23:19:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought he did trumpet in school
28-03-2018T23:19:23,Dadrobit,I thought he was a trumpet player?
28-03-2018T23:19:23,Vatruvius,probably*
28-03-2018T23:20:04,Vatruvius,Yeah...but he has been getting into music in the last year or so. I would not be surprised if he bought more instruments but again I said I think he has one...not certain of it.
28-03-2018T23:20:27,Vatruvius,I know for sure he has a trumpet and guitar.
28-03-2018T23:20:37,Vatruvius,And a keyboard
28-03-2018T23:21:36,Vatruvius,But...it is not like there are no images of saxophones on there internet for Tom to use.
28-03-2018T23:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I got one: “Flora climbs Trace to escape tiny spider”
28-03-2018T23:21:48,Vatruvius,lol
28-03-2018T23:22:07,SpazztasticKiwi,“Kill it” “I can’t with you on my back”
28-03-2018T23:22:12,Vatruvius,That would be my sister 100%
28-03-2018T23:23:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a bigger problem with wasps than spiders
28-03-2018T23:24:22,unsteddyphoenix,thats cause spiders are chill and wasps are evil
28-03-2018T23:24:28,Vatruvius,My sister is scared of everything. Is there a fruit fly in her room...*murderous scream*
28-03-2018T23:24:36,Dadrobit,Spiders can be chill. Wasps are always from Hell.
28-03-2018T23:25:05,Vatruvius,Spiders and bugs do not bug me...it is just big ones or when they do something unexpected.
28-03-2018T23:25:26,Vatruvius,"Like big spiders, bugs on my back, something crawling really fast up my arm, etc."
28-03-2018T23:25:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Satan’s little minions of spite and hatred
28-03-2018T23:27:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t mind if a little bee buzzes by or a spider is sitting on the railing next to me
28-03-2018T23:27:47,Dadrobit,16 more slides.....
28-03-2018T23:27:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I do care when they invade my bubble
28-03-2018T23:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I so much as hear a wasp buzzing, I am outie"
28-03-2018T23:28:38,unsteddyphoenix,the trick to that is to not leave your house
28-03-2018T23:30:00,unsteddyphoenix,https://gfycat.com/UntimelyGracefulBluewhale
28-03-2018T23:30:17,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ve gotten into the house before
28-03-2018T23:31:07,Vatruvius,From experience and from what I have heard from others...wasps are stupid and slow. They are relatively easy to kill...it is just a nest of them or hornets that scare me.
28-03-2018T23:31:36,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhhhh, the kitteh head rubs"
28-03-2018T23:31:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Hahaha they are not slow
28-03-2018T23:32:03,Vatruvius,They are pretty stupid.
28-03-2018T23:32:05,SpazztasticKiwi,And red wasps can be hard to squash
28-03-2018T23:32:31,Vatruvius,Yeah...I do not have any red ones where I live.
28-03-2018T23:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Guinea wasps are the embodiment of hatred
28-03-2018T23:33:39,Vatruvius,Do not know what those are...we just have generic wasps and hornets here.
28-03-2018T23:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Red and guinea wasps are also severely territorial. Brown, “common” wasps are relatively more docile, but are still big nopes"
28-03-2018T23:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Guinea wasps have the worst stings though
28-03-2018T23:35:52,Vatruvius,The thing we worry about up where I live and Brown Recluse spiders and Black Widows.
28-03-2018T23:36:01,Vatruvius,are*
28-03-2018T23:36:21,Vatruvius,The Black Widows are more common than you would think...make me twitch.
28-03-2018T23:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Apparently there is a guinea wasp. The wasp I’m talking about is not that wasp, it’s a paper wasp, but small"
28-03-2018T23:37:48,unsteddyphoenix,spooky
28-03-2018T23:40:03,Dadrobit,brb
28-03-2018T23:40:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Technically they’re all “paper wasps” - just different sub types - brown, red, and brown but smaller"
28-03-2018T23:40:58,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re all little chariots of firey hatred and unnecessary spite though
28-03-2018T23:41:22,Vatruvius,How many times have you been stung/attacked by a wasp Kiwi?
28-03-2018T23:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Let’s see..
28-03-2018T23:41:35,unsteddyphoenix,Enough to be an expert
28-03-2018T23:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Leg, arm, finger, neck, head, jaw, and back. So 7"
