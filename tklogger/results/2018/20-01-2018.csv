20-01-2018T02:35:31,Mihari,Doing a test for the Katbox announce bot on our discord server.
20-01-2018T02:35:43,SageSaga,:P
20-01-2018T02:36:30,Russianconservative,2:36 am and not tired f you lord of the rings
20-01-2018T02:37:20,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, got a question."
20-01-2018T02:37:30,SageSaga,OK
20-01-2018T02:37:40,Bgrmystr2,"Why exactly is there shading under their hair if the closest light source is the fire from, you know, below them?"
20-01-2018T02:38:09,Russianconservative,Artist logic
20-01-2018T02:38:16,Russianconservative,Don’t question
20-01-2018T02:38:18,Bgrmystr2,"wouldn't the bottom of their hair be all lit up, and the top of it be dark?"
20-01-2018T02:38:19,Bgrmystr2,lol
20-01-2018T02:38:39,SageSaga,light from a large fire spreads out a lot - if she was right over the fire- totally
20-01-2018T02:38:54,SageSaga,further away- its less of an issue and more of an omnipresent light
20-01-2018T02:38:54,Russianconservative,Science!
20-01-2018T02:39:10,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: artist logic indeed
20-01-2018T02:39:13,Bgrmystr2,xD

20-01-2018T02:39:45,Bgrmystr2,I dunno where the fire is in comparison so
20-01-2018T02:39:45,TheBeckoner,Hey Russian
20-01-2018T02:39:50,SageSaga,also if you draw shading light that it will look like the scene is supposed to be creepy
20-01-2018T02:39:55,SageSaga,so its about mood lighting too
20-01-2018T02:40:01,TheBeckoner,Looks like its towards the bottom left
20-01-2018T02:40:10,Russianconservative,I crawled out of the depths of hell again

20-01-2018T14:42:33,TheBeckoner,95 minutes is 95 minutes too many
20-01-2018T14:43:02,Dadrobit,"Eh, it is what it is. Online class is still a class yo."
20-01-2018T14:43:19,TheBeckoner,True.
20-01-2018T14:43:26,Dadrobit,Hour or two a week isn't terrible at all.
20-01-2018T14:43:49,NeonMitsumi,I'd watch 95 minutes of that.

20-01-2018T15:13:08,TheBeckoner,I think I voted Alaric and Mike but I can't remember
20-01-2018T15:13:09,MidnightBlue78,Flora only got one vote?
20-01-2018T15:13:18,MidnightBlue78,that is crazy
20-01-2018T15:13:51,Serpentfrog,Alaric and  Euchre for me.
20-01-2018T15:14:10,TheBeckoner,I mean she has 89 tags.
20-01-2018T15:14:30,NeonMitsumi,It was something like anyone with under 20 tages
20-01-2018T15:14:32,NeonMitsumi,*tags
20-01-2018T15:16:05,Xexanoth,so this character poll is a new thing?
20-01-2018T15:16:21,Serpentfrog,Yes.
20-01-2018T15:16:28,MidnightBlue78,I voted Karen and Sythe
20-01-2018T15:16:40,Xexanoth,nice
20-01-2018T15:17:54,Combak,What exactly was the poll question?
20-01-2018T15:18:22,Combak,"Also, yeah, kinda annoyed I missed that stream. :/"
20-01-2018T15:18:40,Serpentfrog,Characters with &lt;20 tags we wanted to see.
20-01-2018T15:18:52,TheBeckoner,Well just don't miss the next one ;)
20-01-2018T15:19:23,TheBeckoner,Well I'm tired.
20-01-2018T15:19:30,TheBeckoner,has left to take a nap.
20-01-2018T15:20:00,Xexanoth,"at least you can just ""miss"" them, not like ""no chance of watching because middle of the night"""
20-01-2018T15:20:49,Serpentfrog,That's assuming a normal sleep schedule. :P
20-01-2018T15:21:45,NeonMitsumi,And I am just here debating should I stay and watch or take a nap and finish Physics essay. lol
20-01-2018T15:22:09,zolstarym,what is the physics essay about?
20-01-2018T15:22:10,Xexanoth,"take nap, then watch :)"
20-01-2018T15:22:24,Serpentfrog,Multitask: write the essay while watching.
20-01-2018T15:22:40,NeonMitsumi,10 minute nap? pffft
20-01-2018T15:22:47,NeonMitsumi,"Yeah, but the chat though."
20-01-2018T15:22:50,Xexanoth,40 mins
20-01-2018T15:23:01,Serpentfrog,We're dumb. Ignore us.
20-01-2018T15:23:17,NeonMitsumi,Hm.
20-01-2018T15:23:29,Xexanoth,"but we're also annoying, so it's hard to ignore"
20-01-2018T15:23:43,NeonMitsumi,Hmmm.
20-01-2018T15:23:45,Serpentfrog,Not if you hide chat.
20-01-2018T15:23:54,NeonMitsumi,Chat is on stream too.
20-01-2018T15:24:09,Serpentfrog,Not if you hide the stream.
20-01-2018T15:24:18,NeonMitsumi,Brilliant.
20-01-2018T15:24:25,Serpentfrog,Ezpz.
20-01-2018T15:25:43,Combak,I wish I could multitask that stuff.
20-01-2018T15:26:22,Serpentfrog,What you need to do is cut your brain in half. Then you can focus on two things at once.
20-01-2018T15:26:29,NeonMitsumi,takes a nap too.
20-01-2018T15:26:38,Serpentfrog,Sleep well.
20-01-2018T15:26:50,Xexanoth,are you taking a KatNap?:ptv-uneasy:
20-01-2018T15:27:08,NeonMitsumi,:cneonmitsumi-floof_grenade: Always.
20-01-2018T15:30:24,TheDixieNutjob,I would but I don't do naps well
20-01-2018T15:30:26,qwe304,:cqwe304-11680:
20-01-2018T15:30:41,TheDixieNutjob,one hour slept during the day for me ends up losing one at night
20-01-2018T15:31:45,Xexanoth,lifehack: to avoid naps just get a full night of sleep
20-01-2018T15:32:29,Serpentfrog,"To avoid naps, consume copius caffeine."
20-01-2018T15:32:56,Xexanoth,fbi teached me to say no to drugs
20-01-2018T15:33:37,Serpentfrog,What are you? A Mormon?
20-01-2018T15:33:54,Xexanoth,"nah, just someone who doesn't like coffee"
20-01-2018T15:34:26,Xexanoth,"then again, i don't need a lot of sleep"
20-01-2018T15:35:03,MidnightBlue78,mormons dont drink coffee?
20-01-2018T15:35:09,Serpentfrog,Nope.
20-01-2018T15:35:32,MidnightBlue78,hmmmm
20-01-2018T15:35:35,Serpentfrog,"Well, some do, but it is against their beliefs."
20-01-2018T15:36:03,TheDixieNutjob,I don't drink coffee but that's because I find it nasty
20-01-2018T15:36:26,Serpentfrog,Then you probably only had black coffee.
20-01-2018T15:36:31,TheDixieNutjob,nope
20-01-2018T15:36:41,TheDixieNutjob,the coffee I had all had creamers in them
20-01-2018T15:36:46,Xexanoth,black coffee is the only way coffe is even remotely drinkable
20-01-2018T15:37:06,Xexanoth,other then putting so much shit in it that it doesn't count as coffee anymore
20-01-2018T15:37:08,MidnightBlue78,i did not know that about mormons
20-01-2018T15:37:33,Serpentfrog,Saying you don't like the flavor of coffee is like saying you don't like the flavor of ice cream. There are countless different ones.
20-01-2018T15:38:04,Xexanoth,any they all suck
20-01-2018T15:38:26,Serpentfrog,I'm sure you've tried them all. /s
20-01-2018T15:38:29,TheDixieNutjob,I'm the guy who would drink a coke in a blizzard long before I have a cup of coffee
20-01-2018T15:39:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello o/
20-01-2018T15:39:17,Xexanoth,Hi Marv
20-01-2018T15:39:18,Serpentfrog,"Hey, Marv."
20-01-2018T15:39:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Hi Xex, Frogy"
20-01-2018T15:39:44,MadMaxton,Good evening
20-01-2018T15:40:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Mad
20-01-2018T15:40:18,Serpentfrog,"Actually, since the world is flat, it's morning everywhere right now."
20-01-2018T15:40:27,Xexanoth,Your name makes me imagine a very posh british mad max @MadMaxton
20-01-2018T15:42:03,MadMaxton,"I just took the name because I was playing the Mad Max game at the time and I was sure MadMax would be taken already, also it seemed boring"
20-01-2018T15:42:30,Serpentfrog,"Mad Max seemed boring? You fuckin' what, mate?"
20-01-2018T15:42:39,Xexanoth,the name....
20-01-2018T15:43:07,MadMaxton,the choice was too obvious
20-01-2018T15:43:43,Serpentfrog,God forbid we have normal names.
20-01-2018T15:44:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know now that I think about it Nora really needs to learn not to mess with other people's boyfriends.   ;P
20-01-2018T15:44:39,Xexanoth,"you mean ""mess more"""
20-01-2018T15:44:47,Serpentfrog,But do dragons mate for life?
20-01-2018T15:44:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,No not really
20-01-2018T15:45:10,Xexanoth,"from what we've seen so far, propably not"
20-01-2018T15:45:16,MadMaxton,To me it really seemes like Nora and Trace used to be a thing
20-01-2018T15:45:35,Serpentfrog,They don't because they aren't alive. :v
20-01-2018T15:45:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,They can remarry.  Or if they're the queen they could execute their husband and remarry if he tries to overthrow her.
20-01-2018T15:46:28,ThingsAreMoving,Depends on the world. Pern dragons don't mate for life. Dragonlance dragons on the othe hand do mate for life
20-01-2018T15:46:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,Come to think about it I wonder there other types of dragons in the TK universe.
20-01-2018T15:47:22,Serpentfrog,Eastern dragons or riot.
20-01-2018T15:47:25,MadMaxton,We know Nora and Reni so far
20-01-2018T15:47:48,Twokinds,Those are it.
20-01-2018T15:47:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,Speaking of Pern Dragons apparently if two dragons have sex with each other then their riders will have sex with each other too regardless if they're the same gender or what their sexual preferences are.
20-01-2018T15:48:24,TheDixieNutjob,"the only two dragons in the world? my goodness TK, who is the bastard who committed genocide against them?"
20-01-2018T15:48:28,Xexanoth,that sound like a weird fetish of the author....
20-01-2018T15:48:31,TheDixieNutjob,:ptv-shock:
20-01-2018T15:48:38,Xexanoth,Trace?
20-01-2018T15:48:50,qwe304,"hey tom, hows the progress on book 4?"
20-01-2018T15:49:00,Twokinds,"No one, there's just only been two."
20-01-2018T15:49:08,Twokinds,Book 4 will be done in February.
20-01-2018T15:49:12,Twokinds,Preorders in March.

20-01-2018T15:49:24,Twokinds,"Also, qwe, your suggest &gt;_&lt;"
20-01-2018T15:49:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Xexanoth I think she was trying to do something different.
20-01-2018T15:49:33,Twokinds,Really?!
20-01-2018T15:49:49,Serpentfrog,"Qwe, what did you do?"
20-01-2018T15:49:51,qwe304,"ok, i see how it could be weird"
20-01-2018T15:50:02,qwe304,i mean like she just randomly gets soaked
20-01-2018T15:50:06,Xexanoth,in hindsight or just in general qwe?
20-01-2018T15:50:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hooray!  Still hoping for you to release the art book on PDF!

20-01-2018T15:55:42,Twokinds,"One person's suggestion is just ""SailorFederation"""
20-01-2018T15:55:42,Dadrobit,It's a terrible idea from Tom's viewpoint unless he likes losing sales.
20-01-2018T15:55:45,Twokinds,I don't know what that means.
20-01-2018T15:55:54,Serpentfrog,Skip.
20-01-2018T15:56:01,Ordithus,SailorFederation is one of your patrons.  I think he goofed.

20-01-2018T15:56:22,Twokinds,"Yeah, he switched the lines. WHY? How"
20-01-2018T15:56:25,MidnightBlue78,maybe he failed to submit it

20-01-2018T15:56:33,Xexanoth,because he could!
20-01-2018T15:56:35,LeKnightWolf,that looks nice Illiar
20-01-2018T15:56:42,iliar,@PalmettoPathfinder1 I think it's impossible. As soon as the artbook will appear in the PDF it will be immediately posted on the Internet.
20-01-2018T15:56:42,SomeOtherTom,Yeah who does that? *whistles*
20-01-2018T15:56:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,might have been paying attention

20-01-2018T15:56:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Not everyone is going to pass it around plus, you could always stamp it with whoever buys the PDF to keep it from being shared."
20-01-2018T15:56:53,MidnightBlue78,"well, its been known to happen"

20-01-2018T15:58:36,MadMaxton,Hey
20-01-2018T15:58:37,BadFoMo,@ThingsAreMoving You just skip a week.

20-01-2018T15:59:09,Dadrobit,It's a moral obligation to have it look like something else.
20-01-2018T15:59:10,TheDixieNutjob,remember that video?
20-01-2018T15:59:16,NeonMitsumi,Furries are here to ruin everything. lol

20-01-2018T16:06:27,Ordithus,Twenty words or less
20-01-2018T16:06:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh no, how will wesurvive"
20-01-2018T16:06:32,ThingsAreMoving,I can do with 30
20-01-2018T16:06:33,NeonMitsumi,Send your suggestions on Twitter
20-01-2018T16:06:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,make it 5
20-01-2018T16:06:40,InTheLionsDen,The sketch guidelines should also limit the character count.
20-01-2018T16:06:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well Tom you don't have to do full body.  Well I like to be detailed.
20-01-2018T16:06:40,Combak,"Also, hi Ossem!"

20-01-2018T16:06:56,Serpentfrog,"3, Marv. Zen or Red."
20-01-2018T16:06:58,BadFoMo,@ThingsAreMoving ...Sketch Request; Pregnancy chart.
20-01-2018T16:06:59,Combak,It's still too many characters. XD
20-01-2018T16:06:59,Ossem1,This is going to be good
20-01-2018T16:06:59,NeonMitsumi,It's a sketch stream. What details lol
20-01-2018T16:07:01,unsteddyphoenix,I lked to make others be detailed*
20-01-2018T16:07:04,Combak,Hi Azuma.

20-01-2018T16:07:07,ThingsAreMoving,"lolo no, FoMo"
20-01-2018T16:07:12,TheFDdriver,just a word that describes
20-01-2018T16:07:15,ThingsAreMoving,no pregnancies pls
20-01-2018T16:07:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,However what about refs!?  Will they count to our total of word count?
20-01-2018T16:07:18,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: Morning guys
20-01-2018T16:07:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Bgr
20-01-2018T16:07:27,NeonMitsumi,End yourself FoMo lol
20-01-2018T16:07:28,Serpentfrog,"Same, Things."
20-01-2018T16:07:30,BadFoMo,@Twokinds 144 limit?! NOOOoooo!
20-01-2018T16:07:32,unsteddyphoenix,Yo bgr
20-01-2018T16:07:34,Xexanoth,"sprays BadFoMo with a water bottle: No, Bad!"
20-01-2018T16:07:36,Combak,You shouldn't need a reference!
20-01-2018T16:07:40,Combak,... I think.
20-01-2018T16:08:00,TheFDdriver,sheet?
20-01-2018T16:08:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,You do if you're using characters or outfits from other sources.
20-01-2018T16:08:04,unsteddyphoenix,depends on what it is
20-01-2018T16:08:10,unsteddyphoenix,yeah
20-01-2018T16:08:12,Combak,"Also, Twitter doubled it's character limit."
20-01-2018T16:08:33,Serpentfrog,"""It is character limit"" :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:"
20-01-2018T16:08:33,Combak,"Yeah, I thought of that reason after saying it. However, it's unlikely to win in that case."
20-01-2018T16:08:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Plus a word count is really fair.  I don't mind if I'm punished but it's extremely unfair and utterly rude to punish everyone for my mistakes!
20-01-2018T16:08:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,Word count isn't really fair
20-01-2018T16:08:57,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes you gotta have faith~
20-01-2018T16:09:00,RandomTKLover,:angel_tone5:
20-01-2018T16:09:06,NeonMitsumi,types two pages of Word document
20-01-2018T16:09:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lucky faith
20-01-2018T16:09:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Youre not the only one who does it, it's a select few"
20-01-2018T16:09:33,MadMaxton,writes a 15 page long essay
20-01-2018T16:09:38,Serpentfrog,"Noah's Ark is a quantum problem, Marv."
20-01-2018T16:09:40,BoxStealthFox,"You need talk like caveman, get to point fast"
20-01-2018T16:09:41,Xexanoth,"i mean, 144 is more then enough"
20-01-2018T16:09:42,Ordithus,The form does suggest one or two sentences...
20-01-2018T16:09:45,ThingsAreMoving,cooldown isn't fair. if your suggestion gets picked twice in a row that means your suggestions are what the public wants
20-01-2018T16:09:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,Plus if you aren't happy or don't like me being detailed then you're welcome to banned me from this stream and patreon
20-01-2018T16:09:50,Ossem1,writes a book
20-01-2018T16:09:51,unsteddyphoenix,what isnt fair is tom  having to read essays before the stream which slows it down for everyone
20-01-2018T16:09:52,Xexanoth,i doubt anyone ever got past 50.....
20-01-2018T16:09:58,ThingsAreMoving,lol
20-01-2018T16:10:08,TheFDdriver,true
20-01-2018T16:10:11,RandomTKLover,Except palomino
20-01-2018T16:10:20,NeonMitsumi,And Moppy
20-01-2018T16:10:25,unsteddyphoenix,and amenon
20-01-2018T16:10:34,ThingsAreMoving,and unfteddy
20-01-2018T16:10:42,Twokinds,I'm not upset or anything. I'm just letting you know.
20-01-2018T16:10:44,Ossem1,Okay lots of people made it past 50
20-01-2018T16:10:46,unsteddyphoenix,..maybe tbh
20-01-2018T16:10:49,Ordithus,"Shh, it's OK, have some ice cream :ice_cream:"
20-01-2018T16:10:52,Xexanoth,really?
20-01-2018T16:10:52,Twokinds,It's difficult to draw so much for one suggestion.
20-01-2018T16:10:55,BadFoMo,Impose_a_word_count_uver_a_charicter_limit?_OK.
20-01-2018T16:11:10,BadFoMo,*over
20-01-2018T16:11:10,RandomTKLover,Im more of a gelato type of guy
20-01-2018T16:11:12,ThingsAreMoving,that's why you have char limit Tom
20-01-2018T16:11:12,Xexanoth,"oh right character not word limit, my bad"
20-01-2018T16:11:12,unsteddyphoenix,"unsure, never counted lol."
20-01-2018T16:11:26,Twokinds,I don't want to put hard limits
20-01-2018T16:11:27,Xexanoth,put ons idiot hat and goes sit in corner
20-01-2018T16:11:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well you could have told me this in an email or on Patreon but not in stream.  Or whisper it to me even.
20-01-2018T16:11:32,ThingsAreMoving,never draw something you're uncomfortable with
20-01-2018T16:11:49,unsteddyphoenix,It's common knowledge Palm
20-01-2018T16:11:51,iliar,"@Twokinds A limit of 144 characters will not save you from hard suggestions. For example ""Draw a party with all TK characters."" - 36 characters"
20-01-2018T16:11:56,Twokinds,"5 or 6 characters are fine when, say, half of them are obscured, or behind a table, or distant and undetailed."
20-01-2018T16:12:07,Twokinds,It's when people ask for full-body characters or dragons that it's a problem.
20-01-2018T16:12:10,Ordithus,Stick figures
20-01-2018T16:12:15,RandomTKLover,Gelato ftw 🍨
20-01-2018T16:12:16,ThingsAreMoving,quick sketches are the best imo
20-01-2018T16:12:22,MadMaxton,agreed
20-01-2018T16:12:46,Serpentfrog,Quick sketches are sick sketches.
20-01-2018T16:12:52,Ossem1,Meh i like both
20-01-2018T16:12:55,RandomTKLover,Tru
20-01-2018T16:12:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the sickest
20-01-2018T16:13:07,TheFDdriver,what if someone suggest a giant?
20-01-2018T16:13:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well some of us prefer full body sketches.  I besides I meant half body for that but iPhone changed it to full body
20-01-2018T16:13:10,Twokinds,Stream will begin at 4:30
20-01-2018T16:13:11,ThingsAreMoving,that's why my suggestions shouldn't take too long. and I'm taking that into consideration when suggesting them
20-01-2018T16:13:21,NeonMitsumi,Damn
20-01-2018T16:13:22,ZizzoGaming,BRB gonna go get food
20-01-2018T16:13:31,Twokinds,"You can have full body characters, but then limit it to one or two."
20-01-2018T16:13:36,ThingsAreMoving,"soo, for europeople 17 more minutes, yes?"
20-01-2018T16:13:40,Serpentfrog,"Editing is so hard in this day and age, Palm. /s"
20-01-2018T16:13:40,Dadrobit,Does puppy Zen/Natani count as two full characters since they're pint sized?
20-01-2018T16:13:40,NeonMitsumi,Yep
20-01-2018T16:13:46,TheBeckoner,leaves to continue napping.
20-01-2018T16:13:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,dads back
20-01-2018T16:13:57,unsteddyphoenix,Children arent people -dad
20-01-2018T16:14:04,Serpentfrog,Agreed.
20-01-2018T16:14:06,Ordithus,It's not the size that matters
20-01-2018T16:14:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,Duly noted but please if you're going to call someone out on this please do it in private
20-01-2018T16:14:16,Dadrobit,#Truht

20-01-2018T16:15:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Let me ask y'all this: would you prefer if your boss call you out on a mistake in front of your coworkers and customers.
20-01-2018T16:15:39,Dadrobit,They do
20-01-2018T16:15:40,ThingsAreMoving,We're not gonna ostracize you or anything
20-01-2018T16:15:44,unsteddyphoenix,They do do that
20-01-2018T16:15:49,Xexanoth,"also, Tom removed/change suggestions for too many characters before, it's know"
20-01-2018T16:15:50,NeonMitsumi,Yes. So they don't fuck up as well.
20-01-2018T16:15:52,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a thing that happens
20-01-2018T16:15:54,TheFDdriver,yes
20-01-2018T16:15:54,Bgrmystr2,It's their job to do that Palm
20-01-2018T16:15:54,ThingsAreMoving,learn from other people's mistakes
20-01-2018T16:16:02,Dadrobit,That's what bosses are for yo
20-01-2018T16:16:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,Not where I work: you get fired for doing that actually
20-01-2018T16:16:04,Ossem1,"Well im a sugestion noob, so i didnt kbow this yet. Now i do"
20-01-2018T16:16:20,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds very PC
20-01-2018T16:16:20,Dadrobit,Calling you out on shit and making sure no one else does it too
20-01-2018T16:16:21,Serpentfrog,Noob? Get 'im.
20-01-2018T16:16:21,ThingsAreMoving,lol bosses do that all the time. grow a thicker sikin
20-01-2018T16:16:26,Xexanoth,"also, this is not a job palm"
20-01-2018T16:16:29,Bgrmystr2,then you work in an environment where noone will learn from anyone else's mistakes.
20-01-2018T16:16:31,ThingsAreMoving,skin*
20-01-2018T16:17:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's life when working at Books a Million.  I guess boss who prefers to call customers 'guests'
20-01-2018T16:17:13,TheFDdriver,well Bgr. that can work to your advantage
20-01-2018T16:17:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,I got a boss

20-01-2018T16:17:37,ThingsAreMoving,well tbh. bosses shouldn't ridicule your mistakes but present them as an opportunity for others to learn
20-01-2018T16:17:39,Bgrmystr2,xD

20-01-2018T16:21:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Disagree,pay attention to stream"
20-01-2018T16:21:12,Bgrmystr2,"OtherTom has been here for a while though, no?"

20-01-2018T16:21:34,MadMaxton,Riots in the streets
20-01-2018T16:21:35,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, most places i've worked, they always call you to a private area, they never scold you in front of other employees, and especially not in front of customer as that makes the whole business look bad."
20-01-2018T16:21:40,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't care Serp
20-01-2018T16:21:44,Bgrmystr2,it's just font

20-01-2018T16:21:52,BoxStealthFox,Would make for a good April fools joke
20-01-2018T16:22:02,Ossem1,No lurking (and lollygagging)
20-01-2018T16:22:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's the same thing where I work at Torque
20-01-2018T16:22:04,ThingsAreMoving,Palmetto you need to realise that work doesn't mean slavery. If you're uncomfortable in your current workplace just change it.
20-01-2018T16:22:07,SomeOtherTom,exists now
20-01-2018T16:22:12,Serpentfrog,No loitering.
20-01-2018T16:22:13,Bgrmystr2,A good april fools joke would be changing it to wingdings.
20-01-2018T16:22:15,unsteddyphoenix,Congrats
20-01-2018T16:22:17,TheFDdriver,!!!?
20-01-2018T16:22:22,Xexanoth,Torque you clearly never worked in construction
20-01-2018T16:22:33,TorqueEmUp,That's a completely different line of work.
20-01-2018T16:22:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well I've been having trouble finding another job.  Can't quit the current one until I find another job first.
20-01-2018T16:22:56,Combak,It still needs to be usable Serp.
20-01-2018T16:22:58,TorqueEmUp,Different lines of work are going to have different ways of dealing with things.
20-01-2018T16:23:10,SomeOtherTom,You should make your own bookshop. WIth black jack and hookers.
20-01-2018T16:23:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's true.
20-01-2018T16:23:15,Dadrobit,"Back in security, they used to send a the call-out as a company wide memo."
20-01-2018T16:23:31,Dadrobit,As a reminder to not fuck shit up
20-01-2018T16:23:33,TheFDdriver,lol
20-01-2018T16:23:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,Anyhow how about those Mets?
20-01-2018T16:23:44,Serpentfrog,Just be perfect and you'll never be reprimanded. :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
20-01-2018T16:23:47,Dadrobit,Yup
20-01-2018T16:23:48,TheBeckoner,^
20-01-2018T16:23:53,Dadrobit,S'how I got by.
20-01-2018T16:24:12,Dadrobit,But damn did I toe the line sometimes.
20-01-2018T16:24:24,TheBeckoner,Or be sneaky enough to not get caught.
20-01-2018T16:24:25,unsteddyphoenix,the lines a good place to be
20-01-2018T16:24:37,Serpentfrog,"All we ask of you is a lifetime of service, wisdfom. It's a lot to ask but nothing less will do."
20-01-2018T16:24:39,TheBeckoner,The line is where the fun happens
20-01-2018T16:24:50,Serpentfrog,*wisdom
20-01-2018T16:24:50,TheFDdriver,and bad too
20-01-2018T16:25:11,Dadrobit,"And in retail I remember how the bosses used to come up and ""I apologize for him/her"" and then make the call to all cashiers over the phone about the fuck up."
20-01-2018T16:25:12,TheFDdriver,u never know
20-01-2018T16:25:17,ThingsAreMoving,once you realize your self worth to the company you get the upper hand
20-01-2018T16:25:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,Ugh.  We got metrics and quotas to meet with the magazine trial subscriptions and getting people to sign up for the loyalty card program and when the store doesn't do well then the district manager scolds the store managers who scold us even when we are
20-01-2018T16:25:41,Serpentfrog,"I am disposable, now I have the upper hand, haha."
20-01-2018T16:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,lol
20-01-2018T16:25:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,Busting our butts to get people sign up for this stuff!
20-01-2018T16:26:03,Dadrobit,"""Never kill yourself for a job that will replace you in under a week."""

20-01-2018T16:26:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi kini
20-01-2018T16:26:13,ThingsAreMoving,screw that. the longer you work at one workplace the more you are worth to the company
20-01-2018T16:26:24,TheFDdriver,true
20-01-2018T16:26:39,TorqueEmUp,That's laughable
20-01-2018T16:26:48,TorqueEmUp,Not from what I've seen.
20-01-2018T16:26:50,Dadrobit,Not true in a lot of cases*
20-01-2018T16:26:51,TheFDdriver,and you know the tricks and cheats
20-01-2018T16:26:52,Serpentfrog,"Nah, Robit. i only kill myself as a hobby."
20-01-2018T16:26:58,Ordithus,This next week I find out if I'm OK or awful at my job~
20-01-2018T16:27:02,TorqueEmUp,they'd sooner ditch older employees to pay newer ones less.
20-01-2018T16:27:14,ThingsAreMoving,nottalking about minimum wage jobs like mcdonalds or kfc
20-01-2018T16:27:21,TheBeckoner,New employee = no baggage
20-01-2018T16:27:25,Combak,"Well, this internet fix is making me mad."
20-01-2018T16:27:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,okay.  I'm bit curious here: is a drake and a dragon the same thing?  Changing subjects as I'm getting depressed.
20-01-2018T16:27:32,ThingsAreMoving,but if you're stuck in those kind of places it's your own fault
20-01-2018T16:27:42,MadMaxton,I think drakes are smaller and have no wings
20-01-2018T16:27:48,Serpentfrog,Drake is a name. Dragon is a mythical creature.
20-01-2018T16:27:48,ThingsAreMoving,drake is an adolescent adult dragon
20-01-2018T16:27:50,Xexanoth,"depends on the universe, drake often describes young dragons"
20-01-2018T16:27:50,TheBeckoner,"Correct, no one forces you to work."
20-01-2018T16:28:00,ThingsAreMoving,adolescent dragon*
20-01-2018T16:28:06,Combak,Kinda... Drake is either a male dragon or a dragon without wings. Depends on universe and context.
20-01-2018T16:28:18,TheFDdriver,never knew
20-01-2018T16:28:22,Ordithus,"Yeah, Beck, rent pays itself"
20-01-2018T16:28:26,ThingsAreMoving,hatchling - drake - dragon afaik
20-01-2018T16:28:34,NeonMitsumi,You used to call me on my cell phoneee
20-01-2018T16:28:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,I see.  Also who else uses references in their stream sketch requests?
20-01-2018T16:28:37,WereKeidran,hey y'all
20-01-2018T16:28:38,Dadrobit,"Man, I made dope money after 2 years in security, they still had someone fillig my slot in two days."
20-01-2018T16:28:39,Twokinds,Hm... maybe I should try have the suggestions be short (max 90 char) and then an optional line where people can add details.
20-01-2018T16:28:44,TheBeckoner,Not saying things will go well.
20-01-2018T16:28:45,Dadrobit,Not just minimum wage
20-01-2018T16:28:50,Serpentfrog,"Where do wyverns and wyrms fit that model, Things?"
20-01-2018T16:28:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds good
20-01-2018T16:28:59,Dadrobit,filling*
20-01-2018T16:29:00,WeatherRaine,That would be a good idea
20-01-2018T16:29:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,That might work Tom. Maybe have a line for references.
20-01-2018T16:29:19,SomeOtherTom,Thats another field to accidently paste my handle into.
20-01-2018T16:29:21,EnddenCanons,Hoi
20-01-2018T16:29:24,CrimsonHelsing,I should make some coffee
20-01-2018T16:29:24,ThingsAreMoving,"wyvern and wyrms are not dragons, cause they don't have 3 pairs of limbs"
20-01-2018T16:29:26,TheFDdriver,why people ever wanted 90 characters
20-01-2018T16:29:30,Twokinds,One thing that takes so much time is me rephrasing suggestions to make them shorter.
20-01-2018T16:29:31,MadMaxton,"Wyverns have 2 wings and hind legs, dragons have 2 wings and 4 legs"
20-01-2018T16:29:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Canons
20-01-2018T16:29:34,NeonMitsumi,Gg OtherTom
20-01-2018T16:29:41,Serpentfrog,3 pairs? #NotMyDragon
20-01-2018T16:29:45,Dadrobit,Name: Dadrobit Suggestion: Dadrobit: Optional Details: Dadrobit
20-01-2018T16:29:46,iliar,@Twokinds It's good idea
20-01-2018T16:29:48,HeresyArtStream,SOON (TM)
20-01-2018T16:29:51,ThingsAreMoving,"wyverns have 2 pairs of limbs, and wyrms are just snakes with wings"
20-01-2018T16:29:51,MadMaxton,wyverns can be counted as a subspecies of dragons
20-01-2018T16:29:55,Xexanoth,"@Things yes they are dragons, the 3 linmbs thing is the DUngeons and Dragons definition which ignores thousands years of human mytholgy"
20-01-2018T16:29:57,Combak,"Man, I’m getting mad at this..."
20-01-2018T16:30:02,qwe304,Im sure you could find someone willing to help with that
20-01-2018T16:30:06,Xexanoth,also Dragon LITERALY means giant snake
20-01-2018T16:30:09,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I like that idea Tom
20-01-2018T16:30:18,unsteddyphoenix,I kinda do that anyway
20-01-2018T16:30:21,BadFoMo,@Twokinds I think I could live with that. As long as there's no limit on the second line.
20-01-2018T16:30:22,Twokinds,"Yeah, it'd be a good place to put references."
20-01-2018T16:30:23,Xexanoth,and greek dragon aka the ones who invented the word didn't even have wings most of the time
20-01-2018T16:30:24,Serpentfrog,"The difference is you don't need to know, just pay the damn witcher."
20-01-2018T16:30:31,Ordithus,Serpent even more specifically Xex
20-01-2018T16:30:33,TorqueEmUp,"Sure no one can make you work, but not everyone has the option to get a better job right off the bat, especially if they are working a minimum wage job."
20-01-2018T16:30:34,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
20-01-2018T16:30:37,ThingsAreMoving,"dragon = upper limb, lower limb and wings, wyvern = lower limbs + wings, wurm = snake with wings"
20-01-2018T16:30:41,EnddenCanons,Why are we all talking about wyverns and dragons
20-01-2018T16:30:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Tharkis
20-01-2018T16:30:45,Twokinds,"Like, the line cold be titled ""OPTIONAL: Add details or references here"""
20-01-2018T16:30:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,Because usually that's what takes up a lot of room in my siggestions.
20-01-2018T16:30:57,Xexanoth,"nah, wyrm can not have wings too"
20-01-2018T16:30:57,TheBeckoner,Hi Tharkis
20-01-2018T16:31:00,TorqueEmUp,@TwoKinds Sound like a good idea to me
20-01-2018T16:31:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,Now can that line be detailed?
20-01-2018T16:31:06,MadMaxton,because it came up
20-01-2018T16:31:12,WereKeidran,I'm behind that idea
20-01-2018T16:31:18,Xexanoth,"generally Dragon is a big category that fits allt he different ""Dragon"" types"
20-01-2018T16:31:24,Dadrobit,I'll stand next to that Idea
20-01-2018T16:31:25,NeonMitsumi,Not 2000 words detailed
20-01-2018T16:31:31,TheFDdriver,lol

20-01-2018T16:31:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Were
20-01-2018T16:32:03,BadFoMo,@Twokinds also maybe 2 more slots for backup requests if the first one isn't ok?
20-01-2018T16:32:03,WereKeidran,hi Marv
20-01-2018T16:32:04,Serpentfrog,Memo format.
20-01-2018T16:32:05,Dadrobit,"Okay, I really do need to get back to this powerpoint o/"
20-01-2018T16:32:07,ThingsAreMoving,"Well you can put any label to ""dragon"". As long as it's a reptile and has wings it can be counted as a dragon"
20-01-2018T16:32:13,Xexanoth,"the wings+arms+legs is often called Western Dragon or ....some weird english anm i forgot XD, it's also a pretty ""modern"" one"
20-01-2018T16:32:20,Bgrmystr2,that sounds like a lot of work Fomo
20-01-2018T16:32:27,MadMaxton,doesn't even need wings
20-01-2018T16:32:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,I like the back up line idea
20-01-2018T16:32:47,Serpentfrog,Dragions can be extradimensional cacti if you want to define them that way.
20-01-2018T16:32:52,Xexanoth,Greek Dragons often defined themselves via multiple heads
20-01-2018T16:32:54,TheFDdriver,well redbull gives you wings
20-01-2018T16:33:01,Bgrmystr2,"the whole point was to REDUCE the amount tom needs to read before the stream, not INCREASE it."
20-01-2018T16:33:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well it's 4:32 I guess it's time for the stream.
20-01-2018T16:33:04,MadMaxton,like the Hydra
20-01-2018T16:33:04,Ordithus,I'm game for things being easy for Tom... he's already got like 200 suggestions a week
20-01-2018T16:33:08,WereKeidran,Hydra Attack!

20-01-2018T16:33:25,MadMaxton,Hail Hydra
20-01-2018T16:33:35,qwe304,Bgrmystr2 he would only have to read details for the winners

20-01-2018T16:33:39,TorqueEmUp,Well that's assuming that everyone $10+ is submiting suggestions
20-01-2018T16:33:44,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 The other 2 slots don't need to be used?
20-01-2018T16:33:44,TorqueEmUp,which I doubt
20-01-2018T16:33:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,How are you easy for Tom?
20-01-2018T16:33:56,Combak,Um...
20-01-2018T16:34:13,ThingsAreMoving,My suggestions didn't take longer than 20 minutes to sketch so far.
20-01-2018T16:34:16,Combak,"There we go, Picarto was giving me an error."
20-01-2018T16:34:22,Ordithus,"L-lewd? OH, better"
20-01-2018T16:34:25,Bgrmystr2,"I can see the purpose for the people suggesting, but the chances of it being highly used are very little"
20-01-2018T16:34:28,Combak,Still can’t fix PC connection though.
20-01-2018T16:34:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,Besides what's wrong with having full body characters?
20-01-2018T16:34:30,Serpentfrog,good ol' Potato.tv
20-01-2018T16:34:40,TorqueEmUp,More detail needed
20-01-2018T16:34:41,TorqueEmUp,longer
20-01-2018T16:34:42,MadMaxton,Too much effort to draw
20-01-2018T16:34:44,ThingsAreMoving,full body chars = more work
20-01-2018T16:34:44,Bgrmystr2,"also, if you really think your original sketch is, you know, a sketchy idea, then maybe you should rethink it to begin with?"
20-01-2018T16:34:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,Everyone loves full body characters!
20-01-2018T16:34:52,unsteddyphoenix,literally just went over this
20-01-2018T16:34:54,SomeOtherTom,Full body is fine - just not when theres 84 of them
20-01-2018T16:35:00,TorqueEmUp,Then keep it to one or two characters
20-01-2018T16:35:05,qwe304,Tfwi know i had a sketch done recently but dont remember which it is
20-01-2018T16:35:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well I try to keep fully body character amount to three or less
20-01-2018T16:35:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so it begins
20-01-2018T16:35:34,TheFDdriver,yay
20-01-2018T16:35:34,TorqueEmUp,and minimize use of dragons. :P

20-01-2018T17:25:00,Kamaro12,bgr: or just tell impressionable teenagers to stop being stupid
20-01-2018T17:25:09,Kamaro12,because maybe they'll be less stupid when they grow older
20-01-2018T17:25:12,ThingsAreMoving,same with that crystal growing recipe back in the days. It would produce mustard gas
20-01-2018T17:25:15,Mustanglvr007,Tide Pods taste good on Pizza
20-01-2018T17:25:18,Bgrmystr2,"I'd like to believe that, Kam"

20-01-2018T17:27:43,Bgrmystr2,Nothing about rules xD
20-01-2018T17:27:50,MadMaxton,it's not a rule it's common sense
20-01-2018T17:27:53,ThingsAreMoving,bgr would you eat a goddamn washing liquid?
20-01-2018T17:27:53,SageSaga,doesnt Evolution include creating traits that arent helpful?
20-01-2018T17:27:54,TheBeckoner,Don't eat the soap and dont play with fire. Disregard the latter.
20-01-2018T17:28:05,Bgrmystr2,"no, cuz I ain't stupid Things :P"
20-01-2018T17:28:07,SageSaga,and natural selection causes those with unhelpful traits to die out
20-01-2018T17:28:07,BluePhantom90,hmm Tom you using a new pad or something? It seems a little different then before?
20-01-2018T17:28:16,Serpentfrog,"And removing them in short order, Sage."

20-01-2018T17:28:42,ZahnHolley,All this field trip gotten me sleepy.
20-01-2018T17:28:43,Kamaro12,stupid is a pretty general term depending on how you look at it
20-01-2018T17:29:04,ThingsAreMoving,eating toxic stuff that doesn't even taste nice is stupid
20-01-2018T17:29:07,TheBeckoner,Flora has hand hair
20-01-2018T17:29:07,SageSaga,which is why we have dogs that have been breed to have certain traits which is like forced evolution but those traits sometimes - well - often cause terrible problems-
20-01-2018T17:29:09,ZephyrTWolffox,That's why dumbasses eat tidepods for breakfast.
20-01-2018T17:29:10,BadFoMo,"Aw, Her Hair thing-ys are comforting him too."
20-01-2018T17:29:15,Bgrmystr2,Eating something that is commonly known to be toxic.. tho? xD
20-01-2018T17:29:19,TheBeckoner,*grabby grab traces head*
20-01-2018T17:29:22,TheFDdriver,is a rotary engine count as dumm?
20-01-2018T17:29:25,Xexanoth,"If you eat something that literally says it will harm you if you eat is, you're stupid no matter the definition"
20-01-2018T17:29:29,SomeDudeNamedQ,"aww, I'm getting feels from this scene"
20-01-2018T17:29:30,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what you'd call UNnatrual selection
20-01-2018T17:29:31,Bgrmystr2,This is looking good tom :thumbsup:
20-01-2018T17:29:38,Kamaro12,"yeah, I'm loving the sketch"
20-01-2018T17:29:39,SageSaga,and while nature would usually kill them we keep them alive
20-01-2018T17:29:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I agree this looks sweet
20-01-2018T17:29:43,CrimsonHelsing,"Awww, finally we see this &lt;3"
20-01-2018T17:30:01,ThingsAreMoving,"well thanks to selective breeding we have broccoli, cauliflower, salad, brussel sprouts and other vegetables"
20-01-2018T17:30:06,ThingsAreMoving,all derived from one plant
20-01-2018T17:30:10,TheBeckoner,Humans are weak that way Sage.
20-01-2018T17:30:14,Vexd,Corn as well
20-01-2018T17:30:22,Vexd,Watermelon
20-01-2018T17:30:23,SageSaga,humans are weak- because we play god?
20-01-2018T17:30:24,Kamaro12,"either way, I think it's stupid to say that it's ""natural selection at work"". It's just teenagers following a dumb fad, doesn't mean they should die over it"
20-01-2018T17:30:38,ThingsAreMoving,Kamaro why not?
20-01-2018T17:30:38,Kinipshun,guys... this is precious... i think i everyone could agree with me in me saying i really hope this gets colored
20-01-2018T17:30:45,TheBeckoner,eh to some degree
20-01-2018T17:30:46,TheFDdriver,humans are weak but have knowledge
20-01-2018T17:30:47,LeKnightWolf,well kinda of
20-01-2018T17:30:53,ThingsAreMoving,why wouldn't they be responsible for their actions
20-01-2018T17:30:56,Bgrmystr2,"That is literally the definition of natural selection, you can look it up XD"
20-01-2018T17:30:59,CrimsonHelsing,I'm with you on this Kinipshun
20-01-2018T17:31:01,Bgrmystr2,I would agree Kinip
20-01-2018T17:31:10,unsteddyphoenix,"""weak"" doesnt apply here"
20-01-2018T17:31:18,Kamaro12,things: because why get punished so severely for one dumb mistake?
20-01-2018T17:31:24,TheBeckoner,Yeah this one would make a nice Nora card.
20-01-2018T17:31:30,ThingsAreMoving,"it's like saying ""they shouldn't be playing russian roulette, but even if they did, they didn't deserve to die"""
20-01-2018T17:31:34,SageSaga,i dont think they should die over it either but seriously- you learn this stuff when you are 2- and they are popularizing it to the point kids who should know better are imitating it
20-01-2018T17:31:36,Kinipshun,agreed beck
20-01-2018T17:31:41,Xexanoth,@Kamaro because the Tide Pod packaging LITERALLY SAYS IT'S TOXIC!
20-01-2018T17:31:50,BluePhantom90,heh going to put a crib next to the bed or something tom? lol
20-01-2018T17:31:52,Serpentfrog,Still the kids' choice.
20-01-2018T17:31:57,TheBeckoner,^
20-01-2018T17:32:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No blue
20-01-2018T17:32:10,Xexanoth,thats like playing russian roulette and expecting to live
20-01-2018T17:32:10,Bgrmystr2,Consequences are a bitch. That's life. It doesn't take prisoners.
20-01-2018T17:32:20,TheFDdriver,if you win
20-01-2018T17:32:23,NeonMitsumi,This is supposed to be something emotional
20-01-2018T17:32:26,Kamaro12,"bgr: well yeah, I'm not arguing that"
20-01-2018T17:32:26,ThingsAreMoving,once you learn how to read there's no excuse for eating TOXIC stuff
20-01-2018T17:32:28,SageSaga,life totally takes prisoners
20-01-2018T17:32:32,ThingsAreMoving,no matter the age
20-01-2018T17:32:39,unsteddyphoenix,Look at coma patients

20-01-2018T19:02:10,Bgrmystr2,and it's cuz it follows the same rule as extending the last letter of a word
20-01-2018T19:02:15,Bgrmystr2,to put emphasis on it
20-01-2018T19:02:18,kts,Dawwww

20-01-2018T19:03:18,Bgrmystr2,that wasn't the topic XD
20-01-2018T19:03:18,Sunfish43,lol is because they want to let the commenter know it is funny.
20-01-2018T19:03:28,Sunfish43,"Same with XD, it's just a funny face"
20-01-2018T19:03:35,Xexanoth,also XD changes to a laughing smiley in most apps
20-01-2018T19:03:48,MetalAppleSauce,I would use :laughing: more often but XD is typed much faster
20-01-2018T19:03:51,TheFDdriver,lol
20-01-2018T19:03:56,Terramaster20209,well they can laugh it literally translates to laugh out loud
20-01-2018T19:03:57,ThingsAreMoving,"I eat tidepods for lunch. No fat, no sugar, just a bit of protein and lots of fluids"
20-01-2018T19:04:00,Sunfish43,"True, :) is an emoji where as XD isn't"

20-01-2018T19:05:39,Bgrmystr2,there's a difference between like.. showing the entire head as a big picture
20-01-2018T19:05:43,ChromeDragon24,ye think so things

20-01-2018T19:18:07,Terramaster20209,hello
20-01-2018T19:18:34,BadFoMo,"@MetalAppleSauce ...Uh, Gordon Freeman had one in Half-Life 1 and he made it look good?"
20-01-2018T19:19:27,ThingsAreMoving,"Terra as a guy that used to have long hair, it's waaaay more practical to have short hair"
20-01-2018T19:19:40,MetalAppleSauce,first thing that comes to my mind is Sythe as Gordon Freeman

20-01-2018T19:23:19,ThingsAreMoving,I have 30% silver hair now and I'm still in my 20's. I'm not losing it however
20-01-2018T19:23:36,ThingsAreMoving,could've been worse
20-01-2018T19:23:39,MrRetroRealm,Be happy you still have hair

20-01-2018T19:23:59,MuonNeutrino,@MetalAppleSauce why not? it's the sort of event he'd have gone to as a diplomat
20-01-2018T19:24:11,tehbear,in the name of meaningful diplomacy!
20-01-2018T19:24:11,MuonNeutrino,"faaaaaancy clothes there, heh"

20-01-2018T19:26:14,ChromeDragon24,Sythe prepares for diplomatic relations with king Adileade

20-01-2018T19:28:04,MrRetroRealm,"Crippling depression, trauma, and mental scars refrain me from being constant"
20-01-2018T19:28:24,unsteddyphoenix,"I like how all depressing is ""crippling"" 'cause of that meme lol"
20-01-2018T19:28:28,MuonNeutrino,then don't feel bad about comparing your art to tom's
20-01-2018T19:28:43,MrRetroRealm,Did someone just joke about my depression?
20-01-2018T19:28:48,ThingsAreMoving,yup
20-01-2018T19:28:54,Terramaster20209,for me it's social enxiety depression and suicadal thoughts that keep me from doing stuff
20-01-2018T19:28:56,unsteddyphoenix,I guess?
20-01-2018T19:29:00,MetalAppleSauce,"deppression is not a joke, okay?"
20-01-2018T19:29:09,MrRetroRealm,I also have social anxiety and hair trigger rage
20-01-2018T19:29:10,unsteddyphoenix,"I wasnt really trying to, I could make better jokes about it if you want?"

20-01-2018T19:30:14,ThingsAreMoving,get help
20-01-2018T19:30:15,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of people use ""depression"" as an excuse for not wanting to actually get off their ass and do things. Some people actually have it, but it's far fewer than actually claimed"
20-01-2018T19:30:15,Bespin,I like this one especially
20-01-2018T19:30:17,Bespin,tbhfam
20-01-2018T19:30:30,Bgrmystr2,so it's not surprising nowadays that it became a meme
20-01-2018T19:30:34,MrRetroRealm,2. No insurance to help pay for therapy

20-01-2018T21:16:51,Bgrmystr2,I was hoping to roll back and see what it was you ninja'd right before the first sketch lol
20-01-2018T21:17:06,Bgrmystr2,"looked like flora, standing, doin somethin"
20-01-2018T21:17:40,Bgrmystr2,"I assume it's either next-page related, or nora-card related"
20-01-2018T21:17:48,Bgrmystr2,since it didn't come up in the sketch stream.
20-01-2018T21:19:23,Twokinds,"Oh, that was me warming up my drawing hand before the stream."

20-01-2018T21:22:07,Darkdragoon,did i miss the stream?
