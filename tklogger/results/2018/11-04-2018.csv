11-04-2018T00:04:20,unsteddyphoenix,So jealous~
11-04-2018T00:04:46,TheBeckoner,has eaten half of  a pizza
11-04-2018T00:16:52,Dadrobit,Best Pizza Delivery Person Ever: https://imgur.com/a/UopJF
11-04-2018T00:20:07,Dadrobit,"Also, it's fun to see this development in what people think of me in the forums. I think I have more character growth there at this point than most of the TK cast :D"
11-04-2018T00:21:19,Bgrmystr2,"Well yeah, the story of the TK forums is written by a lot of people.."
11-04-2018T00:21:43,Bgrmystr2,it's got it's highs and lows.. prolly still a pretty good read
11-04-2018T00:28:22,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a pretty cute gril~
11-04-2018T00:28:41,unsteddyphoenix,How is the forums nowadays
11-04-2018T00:29:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, in general"
11-04-2018T00:29:08,unsteddyphoenix,Interesting discussions?
11-04-2018T00:34:19,Dadrobit,Not frequenting it as much as I used to. But a lot of the discussion so far as I can tell is generally surrounding how evil or not evil certain characters are.
11-04-2018T00:34:59,Dadrobit,"S'why I'm catching a lot of flac lately, defending Keiren and Euchre, whilst defaming Trace."
11-04-2018T00:35:19,Dadrobit,Some of those guys are gosh darned nuts though.
11-04-2018T00:35:36,unsteddyphoenix,Well yeah. Furries.
11-04-2018T00:35:37,TheBeckoner,That's a pretty good pizza deliverer
11-04-2018T00:36:29,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt it though :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
11-04-2018T00:36:51,unsteddyphoenix,Hit me with your Keiren defense argument
11-04-2018T00:37:04,Dadrobit,"""I certainly wouldn't mind if kei was butchered, though... and his death could even be a joke, like, he could be dying slowly, reaching out to flora, begging her to hear his last words... only for trace and flora to run off, ignoring him completely as he"
11-04-2018T00:37:06,Dadrobit,"dies alone.  ...what? i'd just find that REALLY funny."""
11-04-2018T00:37:34,TheBeckoner,well alright then
11-04-2018T00:37:46,unsteddyphoenix,Someone shops at hot topic
11-04-2018T00:38:52,Dadrobit,"Essentially, my point is that Keiren has shown himself to be kind to keidran via his ""best friend"" relationship with Flora even as a kid up to only a year ago, while Trace was a racist bastard even as a child who grew up actively seeking out slaves for"
11-04-2018T00:39:00,Dadrobit,himself even before the crazy happened.
11-04-2018T00:39:24,Dadrobit,And that Keiren's racism towards Wolves is absolutely justified.
11-04-2018T00:39:43,unsteddyphoenix,"mmm not sure racism is ever ""justified"""
11-04-2018T00:39:47,Dadrobit,"The wolves aren't being labeled as ""evil"" just because of a few bad apples, the whole dang orchard is rotten and it's lucky that even a single bushel is actually palatable."
11-04-2018T00:39:48,unsteddyphoenix,UNDERSTANDABLE maybe
11-04-2018T00:40:09,TheBeckoner,or perhaps Justifiable...to him
11-04-2018T00:40:26,unsteddyphoenix,ehhhh
11-04-2018T00:40:27,Dadrobit,"Correct, I specified that in my postings"
11-04-2018T00:41:55,Dadrobit,"Bringing war against the humans, killing the human king, likely attacking Edinmire prior to the false flag, razing towns including the one(s?) that were welcoming to keidran, killing their own even at just the suggestion that the wolf was fraternizing w/"
11-04-2018T00:42:11,Vatruvius,Sounds like I should stay clear of the forums then...with this can of talk I will lose my mind.
11-04-2018T00:42:23,Dadrobit,"a human, even two of the ""protagonist"" wolves are just killers for hire."
11-04-2018T00:42:44,TheBeckoner,has fallen victim to sleep and soft fabrics
11-04-2018T00:43:29,unsteddyphoenix,Can someone who has no recollection of their crimes truly be held accountable?
11-04-2018T00:43:36,unsteddyphoenix,It's kind of a tricky question
11-04-2018T00:43:46,Dadrobit,When they continue to do things like kill children?
11-04-2018T00:43:51,Vatruvius,has fallen victim to soft fabrics hours ago and now feels as if he is laying in a warm cloud.
11-04-2018T00:44:07,unsteddyphoenix,Well he was REALLY UPSET /s
11-04-2018T00:44:16,Dadrobit,"Yeaaaaaah, I'm not a big fan of Trace's ambivalence to his own atrocities."
11-04-2018T00:44:46,Vatruvius,It is like persecuting a 9 year old for killing their drunk father not realizing what death really is and such.
11-04-2018T00:45:20,Dadrobit,"And that's part of my pro-Keiren argument, in that even for his transgressions against a single tiger, Kei has taken action to try and make amends."
11-04-2018T00:45:27,unsteddyphoenix,Trace could be getting puppeteered by some outside force though
11-04-2018T00:45:31,Vatruvius,Trace clearly has shown to not want to be what he was...though that seems to be way far from the norm.
11-04-2018T00:45:32,unsteddyphoenix,A la spooky smok
11-04-2018T00:45:39,unsteddyphoenix,Couldve been originally too
11-04-2018T00:45:47,Dadrobit,While Trace has killed hundres of thousands and has shown exactly zero remorse or desire to do anything other than run away
11-04-2018T00:46:03,Dadrobit,hundreds*
11-04-2018T00:46:29,unsteddyphoenix,Well that's true. He's kind of hard to defend really.
11-04-2018T00:46:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that is something that I've speculated in the past that he was approached by a mask like Mary in his time of grief and he let her in."
11-04-2018T00:46:49,Vatruvius,What we do know about Trace is that his past has forged him to be this maniac in power.
11-04-2018T00:47:16,Dadrobit,"However, it still doesn't account for his referring to keidran as ""it""s as well as actively buying his own slave(s) before hand."
11-04-2018T00:47:28,Vatruvius,Losing his memories has kinda hit the reset button on who else he could have been had things gone differently.
11-04-2018T00:47:36,unsteddyphoenix,"he was like, 12"
11-04-2018T00:47:49,unsteddyphoenix,Thats not even a real person
11-04-2018T00:48:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Still, keirens overall attitude and demeanor is telling to me. He gives Flora those papers, but then tries to assert control in the situation multiple times."
11-04-2018T00:48:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Trying to grab Flora to talk, randomly arresting trace out of nowhere"
11-04-2018T00:48:24,Vatruvius,Also...he only bought the one slave as far as we know for sure right?
11-04-2018T00:48:45,Dadrobit,"And it's important to remember, the Dark Trace of now is not the same as when he was originally evil. He turned to the dark side simply when he realized his powers whiles still not having his old memories."
11-04-2018T00:49:01,Vatruvius,Kei may have good intentions...but he is shit at acting on them.
11-04-2018T00:49:44,unsteddyphoenix,I think he BELIEVES he has good intentions.
11-04-2018T00:49:47,Dadrobit,"Flora made Trace seem like someone who could do harm, Kei was protecting her from a possible outburst from Trace"
11-04-2018T00:50:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Kei was the one she was scared of, which he chose to ignore"
11-04-2018T00:50:41,Vatruvius,His powers were drawn from the dark mana right...so it is a double edged sword. You cannot be all powerful without no consequences.
11-04-2018T00:50:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Bragging about being guard captain and ""knowing her first"""
11-04-2018T00:51:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Implying that Trace should concede to his authority, regardless of Floras feelings"
11-04-2018T00:51:24,Vatruvius,Flora was not at all scared of Trace in any way.
11-04-2018T00:51:29,Vatruvius,Not with Kei around.
11-04-2018T00:51:34,Dadrobit,"She was looking at Trace when she said, ""please don't hurt him,"" and it was Trace who accosted Keiren first."
11-04-2018T00:51:35,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the mind of a slaver owner
11-04-2018T00:52:27,Vatruvius,Umm...I do not think that is how that went Dadro.
11-04-2018T00:52:36,unsteddyphoenix,a c c o s t e d
11-04-2018T00:52:50,Dadrobit,"Trace was the aggressor, prior to Trace grabbing at him, Kei only wanted to talk."
11-04-2018T00:52:51,Vatruvius,Kei instigated the situation.
11-04-2018T00:52:56,unsteddyphoenix,He stopped kei from grabbing a defenseless frightened woman what a villian
11-04-2018T00:53:15,unsteddyphoenix,The outstretched hand of discourse
11-04-2018T00:54:22,Dadrobit,Just looks like he's reaching out to her to reinforce his metaphorical outreach to me.
11-04-2018T00:55:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, Trace! You havent considered the METAPHORICAL IMPLICATIONS you fool!"
11-04-2018T00:55:26,Vatruvius,Here is the page.
11-04-2018T00:55:36,Vatruvius,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/859/
11-04-2018T00:55:54,Vatruvius,Flora clearly wanted Kei to leave her alone so Tom was protecting her.
11-04-2018T00:56:01,Dadrobit,Tom?
11-04-2018T00:56:04,unsteddyphoenix,T O M
11-04-2018T00:56:08,Vatruvius,lol
11-04-2018T00:56:13,Vatruvius,Trave
11-04-2018T00:56:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, Trave"
11-04-2018T00:56:28,Vatruvius,I get my T names mied up.
11-04-2018T00:56:37,Vatruvius,:ptv-sad:
11-04-2018T00:56:42,Dadrobit,Good old Trave
11-04-2018T00:57:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Bottom line, I just see Keiren wanting control over Flora again. I dont think he's really ""reformed"" though he might think he is."
11-04-2018T00:58:15,unsteddyphoenix,Either that or his apologies is a manipulative front
11-04-2018T00:58:20,unsteddyphoenix,But that seems a bit dark
11-04-2018T00:58:22,Vatruvius,Kei may want what is best for Flora but he does not know what is best and thinks he knows which is the problem.
11-04-2018T00:58:49,Dadrobit,"I see it as the exact opposite, I think he's absolutely earnest in his attempts to make amends with Flora."
11-04-2018T00:58:54,Bgrmystr2,"""Keep away from me"" Flora says says specifically to Keiran. She was scared of him. That's why Trace defended her. Anyone with proper mind would have done the same."
11-04-2018T00:59:44,Vatruvius,I am not saying Kei does not want to make amends...he most definitely does but he just assumes he knows what is the best way to make amends which is usually not what Flora wants.
11-04-2018T00:59:58,Bgrmystr2,"Trace's dark half coming to bear when flora's afraid isn't really doing him any favors, but it was only there because of the situation at hand."
11-04-2018T01:00:16,Dadrobit,"IIRC, Tom said that he hit her with a crossbow bolt during the escape, and that's why she was collapsed in the steam/river in the flashback, so I get her trepidation, but I still consider him a better person than Trace in general."
11-04-2018T01:00:25,Bgrmystr2,I think Kei's just not the best at wording lol
11-04-2018T01:00:37,Vatruvius,We know Trace's dark side comes out when Flora is in danger...that is consistent.
11-04-2018T01:00:38,Bgrmystr2,and yeah that probably didn't help him
11-04-2018T01:00:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, I mean. I could see him being a better person, honestly."
11-04-2018T01:00:55,unsteddyphoenix,"I just dont think he's a good person, in general."
11-04-2018T01:01:10,Bgrmystr2,"Better person than Trace WAS, before he lost his memory, no shit"
11-04-2018T01:01:22,Bgrmystr2,but that doesn't make him a GOOD person morally.
11-04-2018T01:01:22,TheBeckoner,most peolpe would be lol
11-04-2018T01:02:33,Dadrobit,"Being the least rotten apple doesn't really look good, but it is what it is. Pretty much every human in the comic is a dick, barring Karen, but she's 99% comic relief."
11-04-2018T01:02:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Though, Dads probably right in a meta sense"
11-04-2018T01:02:54,Dadrobit,Keiren is one of the least rotten apples.
11-04-2018T01:03:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Tom probably wants Kei to be a ""good character"""
11-04-2018T01:03:08,Vatruvius,"My impressions of Trace is that he is good at heart but what made him an evil, power maniac is just how tainted he had become. From Saria's death to Trace's tinkering in dark magic...it just was not good."
11-04-2018T01:03:44,unsteddyphoenix,"If the best defense of a character is ""could be worse"" I wouldnt bother defending them."
11-04-2018T01:04:05,Dadrobit,"Nah, you're not convincing me that Trace is good at heart when he gets into a shouting match, ""the whole town could hear"" over trying to justify owning a slave with his wife."
11-04-2018T01:04:26,Bgrmystr2,Old trace was obviously not good at heart.
11-04-2018T01:04:34,Bgrmystr2,before he lost his memories
11-04-2018T01:04:44,Bgrmystr2,he was an evil dickbag :o
11-04-2018T01:04:55,Vatruvius,Umm...it is common for humans to have slaves so you would be considered weird otherwise Dadro...part of the cultur.
11-04-2018T01:04:55,Bgrmystr2,"but that doesn't apply to who he is now, which is very different"
11-04-2018T01:05:19,Dadrobit,I don't think he's good at heart now tbh. He still didn't have his memories when he turned into Evil Trace post-memory wipe.
11-04-2018T01:05:40,Dadrobit,The only thing that drove him to that was the realization of his power.
11-04-2018T01:05:41,unsteddyphoenix,Maaan id be so hype if Trace became the villian
11-04-2018T01:05:47,unsteddyphoenix,And Raine took over as protagonist
11-04-2018T01:05:49,unsteddyphoenix,THat'd be sick
11-04-2018T01:06:26,Dadrobit,I'm in favor
11-04-2018T01:06:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Avenge her mother, fight against Trace and possibly her father supporting him"
11-04-2018T01:06:51,unsteddyphoenix,Such DRAMA
11-04-2018T01:06:52,Bgrmystr2,"The fact that Trace goes out of his way to protect the very people he was slaughtering before the comic started kinda proves that he has a pretty good heart now compared to back then, Dadro."
11-04-2018T01:07:03,Dadrobit,Euchre joins up with his daughter to take him down
11-04-2018T01:07:07,Vatruvius,Hmm...but that would go against the build up of his character.
11-04-2018T01:07:28,unsteddyphoenix,'spose that could work too
11-04-2018T01:07:46,unsteddyphoenix,Idk if it would honestly. Trace is losing control more and more
11-04-2018T01:08:15,Bgrmystr2,Is he? I don't know about that.
11-04-2018T01:08:22,unsteddyphoenix,Evil smok whispering evil thoughts in his ears~
11-04-2018T01:08:24,Dadrobit,"He has ""gone out of his way"" only once, and is it really going out f your way when the fight comes to you and threatens to kill you directly as well as burning everything around you?"
11-04-2018T01:08:29,Vatruvius,Then let's agree to disagree...I am too tired to argue right now.
11-04-2018T01:08:29,Dadrobit,of*
11-04-2018T01:09:02,unsteddyphoenix,This is a debate
11-04-2018T01:09:05,Bgrmystr2,"If anything, he lost control entirely, and didn't / couldn't fight back in the early parts of the comic. In the recent pages, that evil smoke thing he's fighting against and winning."
11-04-2018T01:09:21,unsteddyphoenix,But the smok is becoming more and more present
11-04-2018T01:09:27,Dadrobit,"Dude's run away the whole time and generally taken a ""kill everything in my escape route"" aesthetic to heart."
11-04-2018T01:09:29,Bgrmystr2,So I'd consider him doing way better than before at controlling the darkness in him
11-04-2018T01:09:57,FenceEqualizer,Yes cause he could have easily not been involved in saving anyone and just stayed hidden
11-04-2018T01:10:11,Dadrobit,"In fact ""I'll kill you all and sort it out later."" is a direct quote."""
11-04-2018T01:10:29,Bgrmystr2,yeah fence
11-04-2018T01:10:39,Bgrmystr2,he could have just stayed hidden
11-04-2018T01:10:42,Bgrmystr2,but he didn't
11-04-2018T01:10:58,FenceEqualizer,Also o/ all.
11-04-2018T01:11:00,Vatruvius,Whatever the case...Trace is actively puttung others before him and trying to do good...avoiding what he once was.
11-04-2018T01:11:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah he's trying out this whole ""morality"" thing, we'll see how he likes it"
11-04-2018T01:11:40,Bgrmystr2,"Dadro, the page you're talking about is this http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/513/"
11-04-2018T01:11:49,Bgrmystr2,and that was obviously trace's evil side
11-04-2018T01:11:53,Bgrmystr2,w/ the tower's influence
11-04-2018T01:12:06,Dadrobit,"Could he have stayed hidden? The wolves were literally attacking everything. ""No one is going anywhere... You will all burn together, traitors and fools alike!"""
11-04-2018T01:12:24,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, probably. If he ran away like everyone else"
11-04-2018T01:12:29,Bgrmystr2,but he chose not to
11-04-2018T01:12:39,Bgrmystr2,that's going out of his way
11-04-2018T01:12:56,Vatruvius,It just shows he has a good heart wanting to save all those people.
11-04-2018T01:12:57,Bgrmystr2,he didn't even know if he could fight back
11-04-2018T01:13:19,Bgrmystr2,"his actions speak louder to me than your words do, dadro. :/"
11-04-2018T01:13:23,Dadrobit,"Nah, not giving it to him. He was barely more than a cornered rat who bit back."
11-04-2018T01:13:28,FenceEqualizer,Honestly. Yes.  He could have stayed out of it unless directly attacked himself. As we saw he clearly has the strength to take care of himself and Flora.
11-04-2018T01:13:56,FenceEqualizer,I mean if cornered means the rat jumping in front of the mouse to bite the cat sure
11-04-2018T01:14:28,unsteddyphoenix,How much magic does he even have right now
11-04-2018T01:14:31,unsteddyphoenix,Is it even established?
11-04-2018T01:14:32,Bgrmystr2,He wasn't even cornered at all. He was in a mob of people that would have scattered when they started attacking the city
11-04-2018T01:14:36,Vatruvius,This is an I nteresting viee I have not seen...
11-04-2018T01:15:12,Bgrmystr2,"considering a lot of them were already running to begin with, you can only kill so many people with an attack group of what, 5?"
11-04-2018T01:15:19,Dadrobit,"And it speaks volumes to me of his ""morality"" when the best he has to offer is taking Grand Templar strength and eventually deciding to help stop a genocide."
11-04-2018T01:15:34,FenceEqualizer,Truth be told not sure how much officially he has but it's shown he has a fair ammount
11-04-2018T01:15:48,Vatruvius,Maybe the forum posts are getting to you Dadro...because the comic does not play out like that at all.
11-04-2018T01:16:04,Bgrmystr2,xD I dunno about that Vatru
11-04-2018T01:16:12,Bgrmystr2,Dadro just might be like this. :P
11-04-2018T01:16:38,unsteddyphoenix,Its kind of vague. Dunno what his upper limit of magical control is. Without that we dont know exactly how much he couldve done in these scenarios
11-04-2018T01:16:43,Dadrobit,"Going out of his way to me would have been dropping the facade immediately, instead of having to debate on how many innocent deaths was worth keeping his identity a secret."
11-04-2018T01:16:43,FenceEqualizer,Well to be fair Trace has a huge backlog of crimes under his belt
11-04-2018T01:16:55,Vatruvius,Maybe...but I have read the comic 7 times going on 8 and I have not seen this at all.
11-04-2018T01:16:56,Bgrmystr2,"that was already established, Fence yeah"
11-04-2018T01:17:25,FenceEqualizer,But I don't think it means he's irredeemable
11-04-2018T01:17:27,unsteddyphoenix,"So if someone has the power to act, it's evil if they dont act?"
11-04-2018T01:17:41,Bgrmystr2,"If Dadro says it is, Phoenix, then I guess so?"
11-04-2018T01:17:48,FenceEqualizer,Depends on the situation
11-04-2018T01:17:49,Dadrobit,Accessory to murder! :D
11-04-2018T01:17:59,FenceEqualizer,._.
11-04-2018T01:18:07,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, he remains unconvincable even though trace's actions prove otherwise."
11-04-2018T01:18:33,unsteddyphoenix,Was it evil of Euchre not to save Rose immediately then?
11-04-2018T01:18:59,FenceEqualizer,Depends on the situation
11-04-2018T01:19:01,Dadrobit,I don't think he's irredeemable either. However I have not seen anything pointing towards him actively seeking redemption until it was absolutely forced on him.
11-04-2018T01:19:19,Dadrobit,"Yes, and I made that point as well."
11-04-2018T01:19:21,Vatruvius,"Dadro...Trace said in the comic that he could not live with himself standing by while lettings others get hurt...that is why he acted. He did not have a counter and said""well...that is 11 people dead...that crosses the line...I have to act now"""
11-04-2018T01:19:45,Bgrmystr2,xD But Vatru.. There is clearly a line!
11-04-2018T01:19:57,Dadrobit,"Like I said, pretty much everyone in the comic is rotten. It's just a case of who's least rotten. :)"
11-04-2018T01:20:22,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, dadro, I don't think you have a very good judgement of character"
11-04-2018T01:20:31,Bgrmystr2,"my personal opinion, of course"
11-04-2018T01:20:36,Dadrobit,"But Trace's first reaction to the battle was in fact, ""run!"""
11-04-2018T01:20:43,Bgrmystr2,but tis what I feel.
11-04-2018T01:20:44,Dadrobit,"Not ""help"""
11-04-2018T01:20:45,Vatruvius,"Take your vile ""who is the most evil"" talk back to the forum. It is not welcome here."
11-04-2018T01:20:45,FenceEqualizer,Damn that is super cynical
11-04-2018T01:21:07,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/915/
11-04-2018T01:21:21,Dadrobit,"""Flora, we should get out of here."""
11-04-2018T01:21:33,unsteddyphoenix,"I'd argue that his first thought was ""keep Flora safe"""
11-04-2018T01:21:51,unsteddyphoenix,Is he evil for placing her single life over multiple others?
11-04-2018T01:21:56,FenceEqualizer,"And my phone attempt to explode for taping that, the hell?"
11-04-2018T01:21:59,Dadrobit,That's the same thought Dark Trace had when he killed all of the children and the King's Guard.
11-04-2018T01:21:59,Vatruvius,That is called a survival instinct Dadro...it is hooked up to the floght or fight response. Google it.
11-04-2018T01:22:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Dont say ""google it"" when youre arguing something."
11-04-2018T01:22:43,Dadrobit,"Aye, more than a little insulting."
11-04-2018T01:22:43,unsteddyphoenix,If youre going to make a point present the facts
11-04-2018T01:22:55,unsteddyphoenix,Otherwise dont
11-04-2018T01:23:04,Vatruvius,I am not going to give a bioligy lesson...that is why I said google it.
11-04-2018T01:23:19,unsteddyphoenix,Ok well next itme dont say anything if youre going to be like that
11-04-2018T01:23:22,Bgrmystr2,His thoughts of leaving were before they appeared on the wall and starting fireballing the city
11-04-2018T01:23:28,unsteddyphoenix,Super shitty. Really annoys me.
11-04-2018T01:23:55,Vatruvius,You are shitty for acting that way unsteddy. I did nothing wrong.
11-04-2018T01:24:03,unsteddyphoenix,Yes you did and no im not
11-04-2018T01:24:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Or, other way around, I guess."
11-04-2018T01:24:27,Dadrobit,The thoughts also happened after the initial attack exploded the harbor and set a portion of the town on fire.
11-04-2018T01:24:29,unsteddyphoenix,Im not and you did.
11-04-2018T01:25:13,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, and they didn't know where it was coming from, Dadro. His priority was laying low"
11-04-2018T01:25:20,Dadrobit,"Taking the ""flight"" path in the presence of danger to a people actively seeking to help set right the wrongs that he himself had helped foster, is not going out of his way."
11-04-2018T01:25:32,FenceEqualizer,Honestly I think your expectations are high. What do you expect him to do? Stuff randomly exploded before the mages showed themselves
11-04-2018T01:25:43,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, fence"
11-04-2018T01:25:45,Vatruvius,Okay...I feel like talking to WIP would be better...as if I am talking to a 5 year old. You do not own this chat unsteddy neither does it give you the right to attack others because something annoys you.
11-04-2018T01:25:57,FenceEqualizer,It's like he had to rip his cloak and shout I'll save everyone!
11-04-2018T01:26:16,FenceEqualizer,Without even knowing what's happening
11-04-2018T01:26:16,Dadrobit,"My expectations are for him to actively seek solutions other than ""run"""
11-04-2018T01:26:31,unsteddyphoenix,Well go join him then.
11-04-2018T01:26:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Anyway, I just dont agree that just because you have power to act it means you have to use it or youre literally the worst."
11-04-2018T01:26:51,Dadrobit,Damned skippy I will! :)
11-04-2018T01:27:19,FenceEqualizer,Kinda need to know the problem first. Trace is strong but he's not super man. Especially with his mind being wiped.
11-04-2018T01:27:19,Dadrobit,And that's fine! Opinions are what they are. :)
11-04-2018T01:27:42,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, dadro, you're not giving it a fair look at all, and making trace out as the bad person when he didn't know what you know from a few panels later."
11-04-2018T01:27:54,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah we'll have to agree to disagree on that point
11-04-2018T01:27:57,Bgrmystr2,you're ignoring the time element and the mindset
11-04-2018T01:28:15,Dadrobit,I'll tell you what doesn't help figure out the problem: Running from the problem.
11-04-2018T01:28:26,Bgrmystr2,"He didn't run, though did he?"
11-04-2018T01:28:36,Dadrobit,But it was his first instinct.
11-04-2018T01:28:49,unsteddyphoenix,Can you really blame him for that?
11-04-2018T01:28:51,Bgrmystr2,because the city wasn't being attacked at the time
11-04-2018T01:28:58,Bgrmystr2,"the docks were hit, and so were the cages"
11-04-2018T01:29:00,Bgrmystr2,but not the city
11-04-2018T01:29:02,unsteddyphoenix,Just his initial reaction to a surprise?
11-04-2018T01:29:08,unsteddyphoenix,That is a bit too harsh
11-04-2018T01:29:08,FenceEqualizer,I think that's most people's first instinct to random explosions
11-04-2018T01:29:12,Bgrmystr2,so it's not actually surprisng
11-04-2018T01:29:16,Bgrmystr2,surprising* even
11-04-2018T01:29:34,Vatruvius,"Not to mention, Trace's reaction to run is a good reaction considering he and the group has been run down multiple times by multiple parties."
11-04-2018T01:29:42,Bgrmystr2,"fuck, gotta brb for a few mins &gt;:c"
11-04-2018T01:29:45,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/915/ More than the docks had been hit at that time. The flames were licking at the trees on the street
11-04-2018T01:30:46,Dadrobit,"All I'm saying is, that I'm not going to place Trace above Kei in terms of goodness when Trace's reaction is to run from the problem, where Kei's is to at least try to help get people to safety."
11-04-2018T01:31:25,FenceEqualizer,I mean he's a Guard Captain. It's kind of his Job.
11-04-2018T01:31:28,unsteddyphoenix,Kei was in a position of authority though. Good chance he'd be running with the rest otherwise
11-04-2018T01:31:43,Vatruvius,It is literally Kei's job to get people to safety.
11-04-2018T01:32:42,unsteddyphoenix,If a regular person tried to organise a crowd it prolly wouldnt work
11-04-2018T01:32:45,unsteddyphoenix,People respecc the uniform
11-04-2018T01:33:27,Dadrobit,"Nope, but Trace could have revealed himself prior and garnered the authority back well prior to the attack."
11-04-2018T01:34:09,Dadrobit,But I suppose that would be going too far out of his way to at least try and seek redemption.
11-04-2018T01:34:13,Vatruvius,What authority? The templar are after him and the wolves were suppose to attack.
11-04-2018T01:34:46,Vatruvius,He has wanted posters.
11-04-2018T01:34:55,unsteddyphoenix,So he has to throw aside his anonymity putting himself and everyone he knows in danger in order to potentially save strangers?
11-04-2018T01:35:13,unsteddyphoenix,I just cant agree with that.
11-04-2018T01:35:16,Dadrobit,"He knew the delegation was coming, he could have revealed himself as an ally. It would have been a risk, but that's the thing about going out of your way, it's risky."
11-04-2018T01:35:23,unsteddyphoenix,I value people I know far more than people I dont know
11-04-2018T01:36:07,unsteddyphoenix,I think this is just difference of philosophies in the end
11-04-2018T01:36:12,Vatruvius,The delegation would not care...Trace no longer represents the Templar.
11-04-2018T01:36:13,FenceEqualizer,That seems out of character. Not even selfishness just that This Trace doesn't seem to see himself as that past Trace. I doubt the idea even came to his head to use his prior position like that.
11-04-2018T01:36:35,Dadrobit,"Yeah, devil's advocate is kind of my thing."
11-04-2018T01:36:46,FenceEqualizer,Especially in such a crazy situation. He's not the leader type.
11-04-2018T01:37:04,FenceEqualizer,Your too strong!
11-04-2018T01:37:09,FenceEqualizer,You're
11-04-2018T01:37:31,Dadrobit,I've spent years perfecting my craft of bullshit spitballing! :D
11-04-2018T01:37:53,unsteddyphoenix,Character not perfect good? EVIL :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
11-04-2018T01:38:12,Vatruvius,"I mean...Trace could pull off being the noble hero in every situation if had knew the extent of his powers and had control over them. As it stands he he barely even knows much about the world, let alone himself and his powers."
11-04-2018T01:38:19,Dadrobit,Absolutely! I'm glad you see things my way! :)
11-04-2018T01:38:39,FenceEqualizer,Damn well you got me then Robit. Lol.
11-04-2018T01:39:21,Dadrobit,It's too bad it took a thousand pages for him to get to trying out being a good guy.
11-04-2018T01:40:02,Vatruvius,I mean...he did not know anything of tge world so...
11-04-2018T01:40:05,FenceEqualizer,"Hah, it doesn't help that 50 pages is like a day."
11-04-2018T01:41:45,Vatruvius,What good could you do Dadro if your memories were wiped and you did not even know who uou were? It would take time too...that or your story would be a short read. :ptv-tease:
11-04-2018T01:41:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Its true, Raine is far more heroic than him. Shes all about saving the day."
11-04-2018T01:42:04,unsteddyphoenix,Funny that~
11-04-2018T01:42:29,Dadrobit,Seeeeeee~ It all adds up! Raine is the real protagonist!
11-04-2018T01:42:46,Vatruvius,Raine has all of her memories...also she is in a totally different position.
11-04-2018T01:42:51,Bgrmystr2,"Back, sorry. Bathroom break wasn't gonna wait, so neither could I. :ptv-uneasy:"
11-04-2018T01:43:01,FenceEqualizer,Petition for Group B to be moved to group A
11-04-2018T01:43:10,Vatruvius,*facepalms*
11-04-2018T01:43:45,Dadrobit,"Yeah, she spent her whole life locked away with little to no magical training, she has no idea of what her power is capable of, but at least she tries to help the people around her, even the one's who she barely knows!"
11-04-2018T01:43:54,Dadrobit,ones*
11-04-2018T01:44:13,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I just don't see Trace the way you do, Dadro. You're ignoring things that matter like time and thought process. You're also looking at the comic with hindsight expecting trace to see it the same way. That's not how anything works."
11-04-2018T01:44:23,Dadrobit,I could do this alllll day
11-04-2018T01:44:49,Bgrmystr2,"In order to fight back against the Templar, trace needs to know what to do. He doesn't know right now. He can't fight back if he's dead."
11-04-2018T01:45:08,Bgrmystr2,"and if Flora's dead, there's no point fighting back either."
11-04-2018T01:45:14,Bgrmystr2,because she means everything to him.
11-04-2018T01:45:23,unsteddyphoenix,Could you? We've pretty much confirmed youre wrong about Trace.
11-04-2018T01:45:25,Vatruvius,She still has her memories and both Trace and Taine wete raised differently. Not every character in a situation can be the noble hero Dadro. The world is not black and white!
11-04-2018T01:45:31,Dadrobit,Naaaaaaah
11-04-2018T01:45:37,unsteddyphoenix,And im feelin pretty good with my Keiren points
11-04-2018T01:45:42,unsteddyphoenix,*about
11-04-2018T01:46:18,Bgrmystr2,"Keiren's no saint, obviously. But he's better than old trace cuz old trace was an evil asshole. New trace without memories is just in a chaotic world trying to make do with what he has."
11-04-2018T01:46:34,Bgrmystr2,"Keiren's trying to make ammends, and that's good, but he's not the best at doing it"
11-04-2018T01:46:46,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed that Raine is objectively more traditionally heroic that Trace
11-04-2018T01:46:59,unsteddyphoenix,And is a better person overall
11-04-2018T01:47:22,unsteddyphoenix,And is and big closet perv
11-04-2018T01:47:28,Dadrobit,Best part
11-04-2018T01:47:29,Bgrmystr2,"Raine seems to be pretty solid, but she doesn't have to worry about an evil inside of her or a dark past chasing after her"
11-04-2018T01:47:30,Bgrmystr2,etc
11-04-2018T01:47:40,Vatruvius,Nothing is linear like you two make it out to be! Agh!
11-04-2018T01:47:47,unsteddyphoenix,Inb4 Raine smok
11-04-2018T01:48:10,unsteddyphoenix,"""Write more smut about your friends~ you know you want to~"""
11-04-2018T01:48:19,Dadrobit,I'd read that side comic.
11-04-2018T01:48:34,Vatruvius,leaves before he loses it.
11-04-2018T01:48:45,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I don't see a problem with Raine because she doesn't have anything to struggle with other than turning Keidran."
11-04-2018T01:48:48,Dadrobit,"Also, the US60 is pretty damned linear. Straight shot for like 40 miles."
11-04-2018T01:49:37,Bgrmystr2,Trace has a LOT of problems that he struggles with. I'd like to see anyone here try to be a saint when given the straws that Trace didn't even choose to draw.
11-04-2018T01:50:02,unsteddyphoenix,Well he did but then he forgot
11-04-2018T01:50:13,Bgrmystr2,I don't know about that
11-04-2018T01:50:37,unsteddyphoenix,"The question is, is the evil smoke an outside influence, or is it a representation of his ""true self"" that Flora is inadvertently suppressing"
11-04-2018T01:50:59,Bgrmystr2,I don't think Trace chose to lose his memories
11-04-2018T01:51:13,Dadrobit,"Ahhhhh, stream lost connection, everything is gone."
11-04-2018T01:51:17,Bgrmystr2,he wouldn't be in the situation he's in now if it weren't for that
11-04-2018T01:51:20,unsteddyphoenix,lol rip
11-04-2018T01:51:21,Bgrmystr2,RIP dadro
11-04-2018T01:51:35,Dadrobit,I'm hoping that the smoke is the influence of a mask honestly.
11-04-2018T01:51:57,unsteddyphoenix,"He couldve chosen, actually. Maybe he had a sudden moment of clarity and ASKED for the mind wipe to forget the HORRORS"
11-04-2018T01:51:57,Dadrobit,Give the masks a more prominent place in the plot
11-04-2018T01:52:10,unsteddyphoenix,Down for some more mask action
11-04-2018T01:52:42,Bgrmystr2,"Based on who likely did it, I highly doubt trace chose the mindwipe himself, Phoenix"
11-04-2018T01:52:54,Bgrmystr2,considering he was kind of leading a charge against those who killed his wife
11-04-2018T01:53:01,Bgrmystr2,he was in the middle of something
11-04-2018T01:53:05,Bgrmystr2,why would he want to stop?
11-04-2018T01:53:10,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, dunno, Neutral seemed to have planned for him to regain his memories. Him wanting to escape what he did probably wouldn help?"
11-04-2018T01:53:15,Dadrobit,wouldn't*
11-04-2018T01:54:03,unsteddyphoenix,ok it's a long shot
11-04-2018T01:54:06,unsteddyphoenix,What a twist tho~
11-04-2018T01:55:30,Dadrobit,It certainly would be. But there's too much mystique surrounding the 3rd floor and the horrors it could unleash for him to suddenly give Dark Trace a way out.
11-04-2018T01:55:35,Dadrobit,If that makes sense.
11-04-2018T01:56:10,unsteddyphoenix,What could it beeee~ :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
11-04-2018T01:56:22,Dadrobit,"Like, I would think if he was trying to escape himself, he'd get rid of whatever he was keeping in there rather than lock it away in his house."
11-04-2018T01:56:52,Dadrobit,A dark shrine and possible the corpse of Saria.
11-04-2018T01:56:58,Dadrobit,possibly*
11-04-2018T01:57:05,unsteddyphoenix,Locking it behind his hella magically trapped house is a pretty safe place
11-04-2018T01:57:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but it's still his house."
11-04-2018T01:57:38,Dadrobit,Get rid of it completely I would think is the action to go for.
11-04-2018T01:57:52,Dadrobit,Especially if he had the potential assist form Nora.
11-04-2018T01:58:00,unsteddyphoenix,There could be some reason why he couldnt/doesnt want to destroy it.
11-04-2018T01:58:17,unsteddyphoenix,"As far as hiding places go, his house is pretty good"
11-04-2018T01:58:22,Dadrobit,I'm just speaking from the point of him trying to escape himself.
11-04-2018T01:58:48,Dadrobit,Locking the dark part of yourself away in your own home doesn't seem safe in the long run.
11-04-2018T01:59:09,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe he asked Nora not to let himself access it.
11-04-2018T01:59:13,Dadrobit,And it doesn't sound terribly secure if Euchre has to reinforce to Rose that no one is to be allowed inside.
11-04-2018T01:59:43,unsteddyphoenix,Well he just doesnt want them murdered from all the traps of course~
11-04-2018T01:59:45,unsteddyphoenix,What a good guy
11-04-2018T01:59:51,Dadrobit,Good Guy Trace
11-04-2018T02:00:02,Dadrobit,I was wrong all along! :O
11-04-2018T02:00:38,Dadrobit,"Oh, wait, you meant Euchre."
11-04-2018T02:00:50,Dadrobit,Trace is still the most evil person ever confirmed.
11-04-2018T02:00:54,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
11-04-2018T02:01:12,unsteddyphoenix,Trace is literally Trace tbh
11-04-2018T02:01:14,unsteddyphoenix,The WORST
11-04-2018T02:01:36,Bgrmystr2,Are you guys actually talking about trace splitting into a good half and a bad half or somethin?
11-04-2018T02:02:00,FenceEqualizer,That would be fun/Horrific
11-04-2018T02:02:19,Bgrmystr2,evil trace vs good trace deathbattle get
11-04-2018T02:02:35,Dadrobit,Fun and horrific sounds like the subtitle to the book on my relationships.
11-04-2018T02:02:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Nah, im saying his pre-wipe self possibly stopping his post-wipe self from accessing the third floor"
11-04-2018T02:02:54,Dadrobit,"Soooo, Death Note?"
11-04-2018T02:03:02,Dadrobit,Reversed kind of
11-04-2018T02:03:09,FenceEqualizer,Or maybe dark Trace erases good trace cause of what he saw
11-04-2018T02:03:14,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah!
11-04-2018T02:03:20,Bgrmystr2,That's only presuming he had intentions of having his memory wiped. But for what purpose would he need to do that?
11-04-2018T02:03:20,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo~
11-04-2018T02:03:54,Dadrobit,The postulate was that Trace regained lucidity and wanted to get away from what he'd done.
11-04-2018T02:03:57,unsteddyphoenix,Toooo forget the horrors of his past? Maybe when he saw Laura in that cage that one time his heart grew 3 sizes
11-04-2018T02:04:20,Dadrobit,"Dark Trace, worse than a seasick crocodile."
11-04-2018T02:04:33,Bgrmystr2,"oh god that song, Dadro xD"
11-04-2018T02:04:54,Dadrobit,"I love that song, this voice was made to sing it."
11-04-2018T02:04:57,FenceEqualizer,Then shrunk two sizes as he wore a wolfs spleen like a fashion accessory
11-04-2018T02:05:07,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-04-2018T02:05:17,unsteddyphoenix,Sacrifices have to be made for FASHION
11-04-2018T02:05:31,Dadrobit,"Yeahhhhh, the meeting with Laura was kinda tainted by him impaling keidran on pikes and ripping off their limbs."
11-04-2018T02:05:45,Dadrobit,Literal sacrifices.
11-04-2018T02:05:51,unsteddyphoenix,It was a slow burn of conscience
11-04-2018T02:06:04,Dadrobit,"Everything except self sacrifice, because he's literally incapable of that."
11-04-2018T02:06:05,unsteddyphoenix,Lumbering epiphany
11-04-2018T02:06:23,Bgrmystr2,I was just thinkin.. say.. if this was some amazingly elaborate plot by evil trace to wipe his own mind.. what would it accomplish?
11-04-2018T02:06:24,FenceEqualizer,Just had to give it some time.
11-04-2018T02:06:32,Dadrobit,"""Lumbering Epiphany"" is a great band name."
11-04-2018T02:06:49,FenceEqualizer,He got to bang a keidren without shame?
11-04-2018T02:06:56,unsteddyphoenix,Now THATS some death note shit
11-04-2018T02:06:59,FenceEqualizer,Repressed feelings
11-04-2018T02:07:04,Bgrmystr2,lool Fence
11-04-2018T02:07:17,Bgrmystr2,he just wanted the Keidran to have someone to trust
11-04-2018T02:07:23,Bgrmystr2,THEN BETRAY THEM AT THE BEST POSSIBLE TIME
11-04-2018T02:07:32,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta reel 'em in~
11-04-2018T02:07:46,FenceEqualizer,Chaotic Evil
11-04-2018T02:07:47,Bgrmystr2,only the best of evil elaborate evil plans for trace.
11-04-2018T02:07:48,Dadrobit,"Right as they come upon Lyn'Knoll, he unlocks and returns to his former Evil Glory"
11-04-2018T02:08:01,Bgrmystr2,evilly* elaborate evil
11-04-2018T02:08:09,Bgrmystr2,xD Dadro
11-04-2018T02:08:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh shit, maybe he wanted to find Lyn 'knoll but he just oozed evil"
11-04-2018T02:08:33,unsteddyphoenix,But they cant find out his plan if HE DOESNT KNOW HIS OWN PLANS
11-04-2018T02:08:44,Dadrobit,Literally out of every pore. Oozing evil Like a fat man on a 20 mile hike.
11-04-2018T02:09:03,Bgrmystr2,"Sweat is evil, confirmt"
11-04-2018T02:09:04,unsteddyphoenix,"It's like, thick evil too. Like milk thats been left out too long."
11-04-2018T02:09:11,FenceEqualizer,But that's a man trying to sweet evil out then
11-04-2018T02:09:16,FenceEqualizer,Sweat
11-04-2018T02:09:17,Bgrmystr2,"ok that's beyond evil, phoenix"
11-04-2018T02:09:19,Bgrmystr2,pls no
11-04-2018T02:09:27,Dadrobit,"Too far unsteddy, too far..."
11-04-2018T02:09:41,FenceEqualizer,That's just criminal neglect
11-04-2018T02:09:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Evil is too far guys, that's why it's EVIL"
11-04-2018T02:09:58,Bgrmystr2,No I mean that's like.. cruel and unusual evil
11-04-2018T02:10:08,unsteddyphoenix,As opposed to kind and regular evil
11-04-2018T02:10:10,Bgrmystr2,that's not just generic haha I'm bad evil
11-04-2018T02:10:19,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-04-2018T02:10:22,Bgrmystr2,yes
11-04-2018T02:10:33,unsteddyphoenix,Well when you genocide it up that kicks it up a few notches
11-04-2018T02:10:50,Dadrobit,"He's trying to lose the evil pounds, but just because he doesn't sweat the evil as much anymore doesn't mean he's not still actually evil. And when he gets to Lyn'Knoll, he's going to gorge and feast!"
11-04-2018T02:11:18,Bgrmystr2,Regular evil doesn't usually bother with like.. leaving the milk out and other stuff.. the little things that people appeciate when evil surrounds them.. a cruel and unusual evil will even destroy that.
11-04-2018T02:11:55,unsteddyphoenix,Lyn knoll will be his cheat day
11-04-2018T02:11:55,Dadrobit,Trace the kind of Evil to turn up the thermostat just a little too much in the torture chamber.
11-04-2018T02:12:06,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-04-2018T02:12:34,Bgrmystr2,it's not hot enough to make your skin boil.. but just warm enough to make you uncomfortably sweaty..
11-04-2018T02:12:40,Bgrmystr2,and there's no bathrooms.
11-04-2018T02:12:45,Bgrmystr2,evil.
11-04-2018T02:13:12,Dadrobit,"False, there is a bathroom. Nothing works, but it didn't stop the last 12 truckers that came through from using it."
11-04-2018T02:13:17,unsteddyphoenix,Trace the kind of evil to not put any more toilet paper in the bathroom
11-04-2018T02:13:30,unsteddyphoenix,"ANd theres just like, on piece of paper left"
11-04-2018T02:13:35,Bgrmystr2,"ahhaha, that's even more evil, phoenix"
11-04-2018T02:14:06,FenceEqualizer,Everyone must suffer bwahaha. *Turns thermostat up* Jailer: ...Jerk.
11-04-2018T02:14:09,Dadrobit,Trace puts the new toilet paper rolls on upside down when the subjects finally work their way through using the cardboard center.
11-04-2018T02:14:15,Bgrmystr2,xDD Fence
11-04-2018T02:14:38,Dadrobit,Single ply too.
11-04-2018T02:14:42,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
11-04-2018T02:14:57,FenceEqualizer,You made man!
11-04-2018T02:15:06,Bgrmystr2,terrible
11-04-2018T02:15:08,FenceEqualizer,Mad really auto correct?
11-04-2018T02:15:10,Bgrmystr2,absolutely terrible
11-04-2018T02:15:17,Bgrmystr2,"maybe you should turn it off, Fence :P"
11-04-2018T02:16:08,FenceEqualizer,I should but I secretly like it when it messes up in the best way
11-04-2018T02:16:28,FenceEqualizer,:ptv-uneasy:
11-04-2018T02:16:40,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, you can learn to do that yourself"
11-04-2018T02:16:59,Dadrobit,It's what I do.
11-04-2018T02:17:01,Bgrmystr2,by watching how auto-correct chooses words based on what you'd normally write
11-04-2018T02:17:02,unsteddyphoenix,No you cun't
11-04-2018T02:17:06,unsteddyphoenix,*can't
11-04-2018T02:17:09,unsteddyphoenix,dang autocorrect
11-04-2018T02:17:16,Bgrmystr2,phoenix is a perfect example.
11-04-2018T02:17:25,FenceEqualizer,"Then it's not unintentional, got to play that roulette"
11-04-2018T02:17:31,FenceEqualizer,"Lol, Phoenix"
11-04-2018T02:17:48,Bgrmystr2,Of course it's not unintentional. The whole point is to make it LOOK unintentional
11-04-2018T02:17:50,Bgrmystr2,while being intentional
11-04-2018T02:19:04,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. Autocorrect has nothing on Marv's and my own ill-fated attempts to spell Clockwork's name.
11-04-2018T02:19:15,Bgrmystr2,That first word is just sometimes too difficult.
11-04-2018T02:19:21,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
11-04-2018T02:19:39,Dadrobit,Like me and whispering.
11-04-2018T02:19:42,Dadrobit,Never works
11-04-2018T02:20:28,Bgrmystr2,xD whispering is buggy as all getout on picarto
11-04-2018T02:20:39,FenceEqualizer,Was going to say
11-04-2018T02:34:56,Dadrobit,"Alrighty, I'm heading to bed. Gotta wake up early to head over to my parents and take them to their colonoscopies before class..."
11-04-2018T02:35:58,Dadrobit,Have a good night y'all!

11-04-2018T02:53:49,Bgrmystr2,ayy you're getting it:ptv-sneakysmirk:
11-04-2018T20:55:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Thar be a stream scheduled tomorrow
11-04-2018T21:58:06,Bgrmystr2,Thar's always a stream scheduled on Friday.
11-04-2018T22:05:50,Bgrmystr2,Shoulda said 'Thar always be' :thinking:
11-04-2018T22:05:57,Bgrmystr2,Ruined it. Disappointed in myself.
