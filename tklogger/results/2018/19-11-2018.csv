19-11-2018T00:02:50,RimaDraws,its ok
19-11-2018T00:02:54,Twokinds,"Not exactly a great anime to watch for the plot. Or... is, depending on your definition of plot."
19-11-2018T00:02:59,RimaDraws,not the best
19-11-2018T00:03:05,RimaDraws,i just like it for randomness
19-11-2018T00:03:12,RimaDraws,now sailor moon thats an anime
19-11-2018T00:03:13,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it definetly was some classic trash
19-11-2018T00:03:18,Bgrmystr2,the manga was pretty good imo
19-11-2018T00:03:18,unsteddyphoenix,That I would never admit I watched all of
19-11-2018T00:03:37,unsteddyphoenix,Also ive never seen it before what are we talking about?

19-11-2018T00:04:15,RimaDraws,like i said the one anime that got me into anime was sailor moon
19-11-2018T00:04:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember coming across that anime
19-11-2018T00:04:41,RimaDraws,that was 21 years ago
19-11-2018T00:04:46,Bgrmystr2,the opening song to the og anime was fairly catchy
19-11-2018T00:04:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Tried one episode
19-11-2018T00:04:55,Bgrmystr2,but the anime itself was eh.
19-11-2018T00:04:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t make it past 10 minutes
19-11-2018T00:04:58,RimaDraws,the reboot is great
19-11-2018T00:05:12,RimaDraws,two times better than the 90s version
19-11-2018T00:05:21,RimaDraws,it actually goes with the manga
19-11-2018T00:05:22,SpazztasticKiwi,..you tried Inuyasha?
19-11-2018T00:05:26,RimaDraws,mehh
19-11-2018T00:05:28,RimaDraws,its ok
19-11-2018T00:05:38,Twokinds,It went on foreeever
19-11-2018T00:05:43,Bgrmystr2,Inuyasha had some great openings and endings
19-11-2018T00:05:45,RimaDraws,7 seasons i think
19-11-2018T00:05:48,RimaDraws,or parts
19-11-2018T00:06:03,RimaDraws,3 movies
19-11-2018T00:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Inuyasha?
19-11-2018T00:06:17,unsteddyphoenix,It was that big?
19-11-2018T00:06:18,unsteddyphoenix,Damn.
19-11-2018T00:06:27,RimaDraws,yea had 3 or 4 movies
19-11-2018T00:06:33,RimaDraws,guys i grew up with this stuff lol
19-11-2018T00:06:51,Twokinds,That jewel sure to shatter into a lot of pieces
19-11-2018T00:06:56,RimaDraws,i was introduced to bebop in high school at 15 years old
19-11-2018T00:06:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. Just wanted to make sure it was Inu and not Sailor
19-11-2018T00:07:07,RimaDraws,it is inu
19-11-2018T00:07:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you seen Inuyasha Tom
19-11-2018T00:07:18,RimaDraws,sailor moon had three movies and 5 or 6 seasons
19-11-2018T00:07:27,RimaDraws,the reboot has 3 seasons so far
19-11-2018T00:07:42,Twokinds,"Uh, yeah, I saw episodes whenever I caught it on tv"
19-11-2018T00:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,But have you finished it
19-11-2018T00:07:57,RimaDraws,i have the entire series of yu yu hakusho
19-11-2018T00:07:59,Twokinds,"And I think I had some of the manga. I never watched it all the way through, no."
19-11-2018T00:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause it’s finally all out
19-11-2018T00:08:21,Twokinds,This was back in the day when it was really hard for me to get ahold of entire sets of anime.
19-11-2018T00:08:32,RimaDraws,^
19-11-2018T00:08:32,Twokinds,I always had like the first couple disks or books of everything.
19-11-2018T00:08:39,RimaDraws,you and me both tom
19-11-2018T00:08:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"On my old computer, I have all the movies downloaded"
19-11-2018T00:08:52,Bgrmystr2,the infamous missing volume 3 for me..
19-11-2018T00:08:58,Bgrmystr2,book or dvd didn't matter
19-11-2018T00:09:10,Bgrmystr2,seven series I think..
19-11-2018T00:09:13,SpazztasticKiwi,The Final Act is still new and pricy
19-11-2018T00:09:20,Bgrmystr2,I'm still missing one of em
19-11-2018T00:09:29,RimaDraws,who likes outlaw star
19-11-2018T00:09:38,SpazztasticKiwi,But at least we got the ending. And Inuyasha finally got his kiss
19-11-2018T00:09:46,Bgrmystr2,that wasn't bad Rima
19-11-2018T00:10:02,RimaDraws,i loved that anime
19-11-2018T00:11:02,SpazztasticKiwi,May favorite movie had to be Swords Of an Honorable Ruler
19-11-2018T00:11:13,Bgrmystr2,"it had the 90s anime feel, enjoyed that"
19-11-2018T00:11:21,Bgrmystr2,"dunno that one, Kiwi"
19-11-2018T00:11:30,RimaDraws,what about trigun
19-11-2018T00:11:50,RimaDraws,and fooly cooly
19-11-2018T00:12:14,SpazztasticKiwi,SOAHR is an Inuyasha movie
19-11-2018T00:12:14,Twokinds,"Trigun was an anime I saw very little of, it was always just in the periphery of my childhood."
19-11-2018T00:12:21,Bgrmystr2,I think I saw all of Trigun on Cartoon Network. All my friends loved it but I just never understood why. Was just meh.
19-11-2018T00:12:29,RimaDraws,it was pretty ok
19-11-2018T00:12:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna go see if I can’t start it up and watch
19-11-2018T00:12:31,Twokinds,"Fooly cooly, yeah. Saw all of that, since it was so short."
19-11-2018T00:12:37,Bgrmystr2,FLCL was pretty good though
19-11-2018T00:12:42,RimaDraws,6 episodes
19-11-2018T00:12:44,Twokinds,Anyone remember the other trippy anime
19-11-2018T00:12:47,Twokinds,What was it...
19-11-2018T00:12:50,RimaDraws,ummmmm
19-11-2018T00:12:52,Bgrmystr2,Excel Saga
19-11-2018T00:12:54,RimaDraws,YES
19-11-2018T00:12:56,Bgrmystr2,:)

19-11-2018T00:13:05,RimaDraws,paranoia agent tom?
19-11-2018T00:13:05,Twokinds,"No, but I did see that. I have the dvd!"
19-11-2018T00:13:11,Twokinds,Aaaah

19-11-2018T00:13:16,Twokinds,Paranoia Agent
19-11-2018T00:13:19,Twokinds,That's the one.
19-11-2018T00:13:22,RimaDraws,the one where the kid hits everyone with a baseball bat
19-11-2018T00:13:27,Bgrmystr2,Ahh that one? Naw I didn't bother with that one.
19-11-2018T00:13:30,Twokinds,I actually really liked that anime. I don't remember why.
19-11-2018T00:13:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah that one was on Showtime beyond.
19-11-2018T00:13:36,RimaDraws,i dont know either lol
19-11-2018T00:13:38,Twokinds,The theme song was great though. I remember that.
19-11-2018T00:13:53,RimaDraws,now you make me wanna watch excel saga again
19-11-2018T00:13:55,Bgrmystr2,was that the one with the laughing man? Or was that from Ghost in the Shell?
19-11-2018T00:14:05,RimaDraws,ghost in the shell is great
19-11-2018T00:14:16,Bgrmystr2,I remember Paranoia Agent had somethin to the sort..
19-11-2018T00:14:24,RimaDraws,i think
19-11-2018T00:14:36,RimaDraws,chobits is good
19-11-2018T00:15:00,SpazztasticKiwi,That one weirded me out
19-11-2018T00:15:07,RimaDraws,i own a few anime
19-11-2018T00:15:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, I have the entire collection from clamp"
19-11-2018T00:15:12,RimaDraws,i need to get samurai 7 again
19-11-2018T00:15:14,Bgrmystr2,sitting on my bookshelf
19-11-2018T00:15:20,Bgrmystr2,great series
19-11-2018T00:15:32,RimaDraws,bgr have you seen card captor sakura clear card yet?
19-11-2018T00:15:47,Bgrmystr2,"no, never was interested in Cardcaptors"
19-11-2018T00:15:54,RimaDraws,this is a continuation from that
19-11-2018T00:16:01,RimaDraws,new style everything
19-11-2018T00:16:04,Bgrmystr2,oh I know
19-11-2018T00:16:11,Bgrmystr2,I'm equally not interested xD
19-11-2018T00:16:15,RimaDraws,have you seen xxxholic?
19-11-2018T00:16:25,RimaDraws,or tsubasa chronicles
19-11-2018T00:16:31,Bgrmystr2,"nope, neither lol"
19-11-2018T00:16:32,SpazztasticKiwi,One that’s similar to Chobits is Hybrid Child
19-11-2018T00:16:48,RimaDraws,oh those are good b
19-11-2018T00:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Same writer of HC made Sekaiichi Hatsukoi and Junjou Romantica
19-11-2018T00:17:17,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
19-11-2018T00:17:20,RimaDraws,tenchi muyo now thats good
19-11-2018T00:17:26,RimaDraws,hi dado o/
19-11-2018T00:17:27,Bgrmystr2,heya dadro
19-11-2018T00:17:46,Bgrmystr2,The one series from Tenchi I did watch was called Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventures
19-11-2018T00:17:55,Bgrmystr2,and it's basically Evangelion but without the dumb
19-11-2018T00:17:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Shungiku Nakamura is good with the romance
19-11-2018T00:17:57,Dadrobit,Indigestion woke me up. Ate some tums. Chilling for a bit before heading back to ead.
19-11-2018T00:18:00,Dadrobit,bed
19-11-2018T00:18:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Can make you cry
19-11-2018T00:18:15,Bgrmystr2,I really enjoyed Dual
19-11-2018T00:19:17,SpazztasticKiwi,You guys have fun. I’ll be back in an hour - gonna watch Inuyasha Swords of an Honorable Ruler
19-11-2018T00:19:22,RimaDraws,wooo
19-11-2018T00:20:57,Bgrmystr2,lol the amount of yaoi from Kiwi is real xD
19-11-2018T00:22:49,RimaDraws,lol
19-11-2018T00:23:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t seen it in years ok
19-11-2018T00:23:17,Dadrobit,o/ Kiwi
19-11-2018T00:23:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a phase
19-11-2018T00:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t judge meh
19-11-2018T00:23:30,Dadrobit,Never watched Inuyasha. Did read it through though.
19-11-2018T00:23:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Sup dadro
19-11-2018T00:23:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Need to watch it. So good
19-11-2018T00:23:56,Bgrmystr2,"lool literally all three of the series you named were guy x guy series, kiwi xD"
19-11-2018T00:24:04,Dadrobit,That sounds like time and money though.
19-11-2018T00:24:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
19-11-2018T00:24:32,Bgrmystr2,I bet if Chii was a guy you'd have liked it more probably :P
19-11-2018T00:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"But I also looked into Deathnote, Inuyasha, Naruto, (very little) Attack On Titan and a few others"
19-11-2018T00:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Chobits just gave me an odd feel because she was a robot. And he was conflicted morally despite that
19-11-2018T00:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,It was cute though. Just didn’t really draw me in
19-11-2018T00:26:40,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, that was the entire draw imo"
19-11-2018T00:26:51,Bgrmystr2,that she wasn't just a robot
19-11-2018T00:26:56,Bgrmystr2,she was much more than that
19-11-2018T00:27:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m mostly interested in the romance and tension, sometimes drama of a show. I probably could watch it now and actually go through it, but i just didn’t like it enough to finish it when I found it"
19-11-2018T00:27:23,Dadrobit,I'm tempted to read Chobits again sometime. Read it as a youngin' many years back and liked it well enough. Tried watching the show a few years back and was not nearly as into it as I was for the manga. Not sure if that's from the switch to a different
19-11-2018T00:27:35,Dadrobit,"medium, or just myself growing out of it?"
19-11-2018T00:27:38,SpazztasticKiwi,And I also may not have been able to finish it at the time
19-11-2018T00:28:10,Bgrmystr2,not really dadro. The anime didn't have enough of the lore or circumstances from the manga
19-11-2018T00:28:31,Bgrmystr2,so it wasn't as in-depth nor was it as easily memorable
19-11-2018T00:28:36,Bgrmystr2,that's one of the issues I had with it
19-11-2018T00:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,The problem I had with yaoi was that there was so much just straight up....you know. Instead of cute shows
19-11-2018T00:29:08,Dadrobit,It was one of the first (if not the first?) mangas I read through start to finish. Trigun may have come just before.
19-11-2018T00:29:09,RimaDraws,ugh dozed off
19-11-2018T00:29:26,Dadrobit,welcome back
19-11-2018T00:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"The ones I found and watched were romances. And that, as well as relationships/their growth, is what they primarily revolved around"
19-11-2018T00:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"In fact, Junjou Romantica literally means “Pure Romance”"
19-11-2018T00:31:01,SpazztasticKiwi,But anyway I’m gonna go see about my movie. And I may very well watch all of them
19-11-2018T00:31:48,Dadrobit,Enjoy
19-11-2018T00:32:19,RimaDraws,oofff i need sleep mrrrr
19-11-2018T00:34:55,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, awake and kinda want to do work. Also kinda want to watch something interesting. Also kinda want to go back to bed."
19-11-2018T00:47:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm on the movie. Might try one later though
19-11-2018T00:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,The urge to rewatch some of my old anime obsessions is real
19-11-2018T00:52:07,RimaDraws,night guys im going to sleep
19-11-2018T00:52:28,Bgrmystr2,gnight Rima
19-11-2018T00:52:36,RimaDraws,o/
19-11-2018T00:53:54,Dadrobit,o/
19-11-2018T01:24:05,Twokinds,Well this is new
19-11-2018T01:24:27,Twokinds,I completed a sketch I started almost exactly a year ago.
19-11-2018T01:29:12,unsteddyphoenix,Woah
19-11-2018T01:29:24,unsteddyphoenix,Was it?
19-11-2018T01:30:32,Vatruvius,Ugh...I am so tired. All this house cleaning and yard maintaining before family arrives is absolutely killing me.
19-11-2018T01:30:40,Twokinds,Nora has trouble walking on two legs.
19-11-2018T01:31:21,Bgrmystr2,did you never finish it? and/or never post it?
19-11-2018T01:31:30,Bgrmystr2,nora card?
19-11-2018T01:31:50,Twokinds,Yeah I meant to but the sketch wasn't finished during stream and I never got back around to it.
19-11-2018T01:31:59,unsteddyphoenix,Wasnt that still getting suggested? :thinking:
19-11-2018T01:32:01,unsteddyphoenix,I remember it
19-11-2018T01:32:17,Twokinds,Recently?
19-11-2018T01:32:22,unsteddyphoenix,Was that really a year ago?
19-11-2018T01:32:26,Twokinds,Yeah
19-11-2018T01:32:26,unsteddyphoenix,Oh god
19-11-2018T01:32:29,Twokinds,"Funny thing is, the person who suggested it isn't even a sketch suggestor anymore."
19-11-2018T01:32:35,unsteddyphoenix,I hate that pesky passage of time
19-11-2018T01:32:37,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
19-11-2018T01:32:42,Bgrmystr2,lol who suggested it?
19-11-2018T01:32:55,Twokinds,Val Salian Resident
19-11-2018T01:32:57,unsteddyphoenix,Well hopefully they at least see it
19-11-2018T01:33:24,Twokinds,They other skech they suggested was https://www.patreon.com/posts/13969306
19-11-2018T01:33:29,Vatruvius,Tom didn't keep his promise and sketch my voted suggestion...I'll show him!
19-11-2018T01:33:30,Vatruvius,XD

19-11-2018T01:34:26,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah but I don't know what that is, it's just a blur to me :("
19-11-2018T01:34:44,Twokinds,http://fav.me/dck1phb

19-11-2018T01:35:23,Vatruvius,"Now, now, unsteddy can you name every sketch?"
19-11-2018T01:35:34,unsteddyphoenix,Theres no proof that I cant
19-11-2018T01:35:41,Bgrmystr2,then do it
19-11-2018T01:35:48,Vatruvius,Yeah!^
19-11-2018T01:36:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Name me a sketch, and i'll name it"
19-11-2018T01:36:07,Vatruvius,lol
19-11-2018T01:36:15,Bgrmystr2,"yeah uh huh, we have to name it first though"
19-11-2018T01:36:15,Vatruvius,Let me pull up my library...
19-11-2018T01:36:24,Vatruvius,I got this Bgr...
19-11-2018T01:36:43,Twokinds,Fight For Adelaide!
19-11-2018T01:36:48,Bgrmystr2,"alright, do the thing vatru. :ptv-dealwithit:"
19-11-2018T01:37:12,unsteddyphoenix,Is...that a sketch?
19-11-2018T01:37:13,Vatruvius,"I am thinking of a wood cabin with Natani, Zen, and Keith..."
19-11-2018T01:37:16,unsteddyphoenix,If it is then I knew that
19-11-2018T01:37:22,Twokinds,It's today's sketch
19-11-2018T01:37:34,unsteddyphoenix,Well there we go
19-11-2018T01:37:45,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm that wood cabin one is amenons uhh
19-11-2018T01:38:09,Vatruvius,Hmm...signs of not every sketch memorized...
19-11-2018T01:38:40,Vatruvius,Was also colored...
19-11-2018T01:38:46,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it was
19-11-2018T01:38:50,unsteddyphoenix,Uhh
19-11-2018T01:39:00,unsteddyphoenix,Amenons weird 3-way ship vol. 1?
19-11-2018T01:39:04,unsteddyphoenix,Was that it?
19-11-2018T01:39:07,Vatruvius,No...
19-11-2018T01:39:15,unsteddyphoenix,Are you sure?
19-11-2018T01:39:20,Vatruvius,Quite sure...
19-11-2018T01:40:06,Twokinds,That one was one of my favorites.
19-11-2018T01:40:10,Vatruvius,Autumn Morning
19-11-2018T01:40:19,Vatruvius,One of mine too Tom.
19-11-2018T01:40:19,unsteddyphoenix,It was a very pretty one
19-11-2018T01:40:25,unsteddyphoenix,What ARE you favourites?
19-11-2018T01:40:33,Twokinds,There's also another sketch that could be described the same way
19-11-2018T01:40:38,Dadrobit,"Wait, is it the one where they're inside? Or the one on the porch?"
19-11-2018T01:40:39,Twokinds,But with natani flipping Zen off
19-11-2018T01:40:47,Vatruvius,I may have that...
19-11-2018T01:40:47,unsteddyphoenix,Aha. I know the one you mean~
19-11-2018T01:40:50,Dadrobit,"Yeah, was just wondering that lol"
19-11-2018T01:40:59,Vatruvius,Nothing like a little mistletoe...
19-11-2018T01:41:01,Bgrmystr2,those are both great
19-11-2018T01:41:16,Twokinds,What are my favorites? That one
19-11-2018T01:41:25,Twokinds,I was really happen doing the background of it
19-11-2018T01:41:33,Vatruvius,Not the viking funeral for the old tablet?
19-11-2018T01:41:40,Bgrmystr2,poor tablet
19-11-2018T01:41:40,Twokinds,Also I was listening to a post apocolypic audiobook while working on it.
19-11-2018T01:41:58,Dadrobit,post apocalyptic you say?
19-11-2018T01:42:01,Bgrmystr2,I like that picarto still says you're using the dead tablet
19-11-2018T01:42:02,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds cool~
19-11-2018T01:42:03,Twokinds,"I don't know why, but if I was doing anything else while working on a long piece, I can tell you what it was."
19-11-2018T01:42:08,Vatruvius,Do you listen to other stuff than we do when streaming?
19-11-2018T01:42:09,unsteddyphoenix,And yeah your favourites
19-11-2018T01:42:31,Bgrmystr2,using ye old 24HD post-viking funeral
19-11-2018T01:42:40,Bgrmystr2,future looks promising.
19-11-2018T01:42:53,Twokinds,"Like, while playing subnautica, I was listening to an audiobook about finance."
19-11-2018T01:42:59,Twokinds,I just know that.
19-11-2018T01:43:04,Twokinds,"Why,I don't know."
19-11-2018T01:43:28,Bgrmystr2,you're the kind of person that listens to stuff that doesn't fit the situation at all
19-11-2018T01:43:30,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-11-2018T01:43:32,Vatruvius,Hmm...I never considered but if you turn the music off listening to an audio book makes sense in Subnautica.
19-11-2018T01:43:49,Bgrmystr2,I'd just listen to other music
19-11-2018T01:43:55,Twokinds,"yeah it was fun, because other than being terrifying, Subnautica is pretty chill"
19-11-2018T01:43:55,Vatruvius,Maybe a book on oceans or survival but yeah.
19-11-2018T01:44:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Dont think ""chill"" and ""terrifying"" can mix generally"
19-11-2018T01:44:21,Twokinds,You wouldn't think so
19-11-2018T01:44:36,Vatruvius,"My biggest problem was never having a long enough oxygen supply when base building. Only when base building, other than that the oxygen is fine."
19-11-2018T01:44:38,unsteddyphoenix,At some point i'll play that game.
19-11-2018T01:44:42,unsteddyphoenix,And Undertale
19-11-2018T01:44:46,unsteddyphoenix,Probably
19-11-2018T01:44:48,Twokinds,"I like to multitask. I feel like if I'm playing a game but not also learning stuff, I'm wasting my time. So often I'll listen to financial podcasts and stuff."
19-11-2018T01:45:23,unsteddyphoenix,I can never do that. If i'm trying to listen to something while doing something else normally i'll stop listening and have to go back
19-11-2018T01:45:26,Dadrobit,Dave Ramsey?
19-11-2018T01:45:33,unsteddyphoenix,Drawing is one of the few acceptions
19-11-2018T01:45:44,Twokinds,"Eh, Dave Ramsey I've listened to a lot of his stuff."
19-11-2018T01:46:06,Twokinds,"I don't find it very applicable for me, because he deals mostly in debt management, which is not an issue I have, thankfully."
19-11-2018T01:46:16,Twokinds,But it is interesting listening to some of the success stories.
19-11-2018T01:46:25,Twokinds,I woldn't take investing advice from him.
19-11-2018T01:46:55,Vatruvius,"Off topic, but was my sketch suggestion a vote or Tom-pick last stream?"
19-11-2018T01:46:57,Dadrobit,"Good to hear. I've listened to a lot of his stuff by proxy. The parents listen to radio stations that feature him, so I got a lot of him for a while."
19-11-2018T01:48:24,Vatruvius,"Ohh, that is a nice sketch to see again..."
19-11-2018T01:48:27,Twokinds,Which one was it?
19-11-2018T01:48:27,Vatruvius,Been awhile...
19-11-2018T01:48:46,Vatruvius,"Winter: Sam ""trips"" into Colin."
19-11-2018T01:48:49,Twokinds,Oh
19-11-2018T01:48:52,Twokinds,That was a vote
19-11-2018T01:49:19,Vatruvius,"I was curious because I think it was the 7th sketch, don't you normally only do 6?"
19-11-2018T01:49:33,unsteddyphoenix,nah Tom gives us 7 usually
19-11-2018T01:49:50,Vatruvius,Lewd Natani!
19-11-2018T01:50:11,Twokinds,"Seven, one for each day of the week"
19-11-2018T01:50:56,Vatruvius,"Tom, do you realize that all your posts on Patreon are taking up half a gig on my computer?"
19-11-2018T01:51:08,unsteddyphoenix,Only?
19-11-2018T01:51:09,Vatruvius,"Well, most of them."
19-11-2018T01:51:14,unsteddyphoenix,Gonna need some higher rez uploads
19-11-2018T01:51:24,Twokinds,That seems about right
19-11-2018T01:51:33,Vatruvius,That includes the PDF bonus comics.
19-11-2018T01:51:46,Twokinds,"My ""Sunday Sketch"" folder of just the pngs is 482 MB"
19-11-2018T01:52:05,Vatruvius,I am talking about sketches and colors...
19-11-2018T01:52:15,Vatruvius,I only skipped like 12 I think.
19-11-2018T01:52:37,Twokinds,Oh in that case my folder is 58.5GB
19-11-2018T01:52:53,Vatruvius,"But your colors are larger than on Patreon, are they not?"
19-11-2018T01:53:08,Twokinds,yeah
19-11-2018T01:53:31,iliar,Only 1GB? I have a problem now. I need to buy another external HDD for TwoKinds content.
19-11-2018T01:53:32,Vatruvius,What is your standard canvas size for a comic page?
19-11-2018T01:54:31,Twokinds,4950 x 6450
19-11-2018T01:54:49,Vatruvius,What do you post at?
19-11-2018T01:54:56,Dadrobit,Maybe he's just after any title at all and figures he can at least get an NALCS Split victory with Tl
19-11-2018T01:55:12,Dadrobit,"Also, I am bad at whispers."
19-11-2018T01:55:52,Vatruvius,lol
19-11-2018T01:56:17,Bgrmystr2,"lol he posts at somethin tiny, 825x1075"
19-11-2018T01:56:31,Twokinds,Tiny? D:
19-11-2018T01:56:35,Twokinds,It's not that tiny...
19-11-2018T01:56:45,Twokinds,I used to post at 600 x 800
19-11-2018T01:56:51,Vatruvius,"See what you have done Bgr, you have insulted him."
19-11-2018T01:56:52,unsteddyphoenix,:grimacing:
19-11-2018T01:57:11,Twokinds,"You know, back in the day, I was told that if a comic page was over 200kb, that was too much."
19-11-2018T01:57:16,Bgrmystr2,"I'd consider it kinda small, I mean.. I'm still using three 1080p monitors in a world where everyone's using 4k and stuff"
19-11-2018T01:57:21,Twokinds,"And it was true, it was really slow to load each page!"
19-11-2018T01:57:26,unsteddyphoenix,By...keenspot?
19-11-2018T01:57:27,Bgrmystr2,even your tablet is 4k lol
19-11-2018T01:57:43,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thank god we dont live in that dark past anymore
19-11-2018T01:57:49,Twokinds,"Well I wasn't on keenspot at the time, but the keenspace forums"
19-11-2018T01:57:51,unsteddyphoenix,How did we even survive
19-11-2018T01:57:54,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh
19-11-2018T01:57:57,Twokinds,Back when I was asking people for advice on how to make a webcomic
19-11-2018T01:58:10,unsteddyphoenix,"And now, you give advice"
19-11-2018T01:58:16,unsteddyphoenix,"How the turn tables, or something"
19-11-2018T01:58:25,iliar,If we talk about the resolution of 1080 * 1407 looks much better if you read the comics from the screen of a mobile phone.
19-11-2018T01:58:26,Dadrobit,That train has long since sailed.
19-11-2018T01:58:36,Vatruvius,Isn't load speed of a page dependent on the service you are using to host your website and the speeds at which the plan you are paying for can handle?
19-11-2018T01:58:43,Twokinds,"Next comic I do, for sure, it'll be higher res"
19-11-2018T01:58:50,Bgrmystr2,"lol yeah with a 2inch by 3inch screen, iliar XD"
19-11-2018T01:58:53,Twokinds,And I'll probably use a slightly taller page format
19-11-2018T01:59:01,Twokinds,Maybe Standard comic size
19-11-2018T02:01:15,iliar,Size does not matter. Most mobile phone screens are 1080 pixels wide. This means that the page in this resolution is displayed without scaling.
19-11-2018T02:01:40,Vatruvius,That depends on the phone and the OS.
19-11-2018T02:01:57,Bgrmystr2,"it does actually, depending on how far you are from the screen"
19-11-2018T02:01:59,Vatruvius,My phone scales everything super small unless I specify to load the desktop website.
19-11-2018T02:02:45,Vatruvius,"Of course, my phone is a little date according to the times but it is still very usable. Could use a larger memory though..."
19-11-2018T02:02:49,Vatruvius,dated*
19-11-2018T02:03:38,iliar,"Scaling damages text. Therefore, reading the text if the page is displayed without scaling is better."
19-11-2018T02:03:48,Twokinds,Mmhm
19-11-2018T02:03:53,Twokinds,Tech has just moved so much
19-11-2018T02:04:42,Twokinds,Back when I started I had to worry about people with monitors of 640 x 480
19-11-2018T02:04:55,Twokinds,That's why I chose 600x width originally. So it'd fit on those monitors.
19-11-2018T02:05:00,Bgrmystr2,they can't just scroll?
19-11-2018T02:05:14,Vatruvius,"Speaking of which, I am excited about the tablet I am going to get from Huion, however, I am slightly disappointed in the upgrade path sticking with their products."
19-11-2018T02:05:15,Twokinds,People don't like to scroll sideways.
19-11-2018T02:05:25,Dadrobit,Left to right scrolling blows
19-11-2018T02:05:26,Bgrmystr2,I had to.. for years.
19-11-2018T02:05:41,Bgrmystr2,it happens. ppl gotta suck it up
19-11-2018T02:06:28,Bgrmystr2,I went from a 1080p widescreen to two CRTs when my monitor fried
19-11-2018T02:06:33,Bgrmystr2,and I was stuck with that for two years
19-11-2018T02:06:55,Bgrmystr2,back in like.. I dunno 4 or 5 years ago?
19-11-2018T02:06:59,Bgrmystr2,maybe 6
19-11-2018T02:07:12,Vatruvius,"The more expensive versions have increased color accuracy with the most expensive one being 100% accurate, however, both, one at 18"" and the other at 21"" or 23"", is still only in 1080p..."
19-11-2018T02:07:23,Bgrmystr2,you deal with the cards you got.
19-11-2018T02:07:57,Dadrobit,"Fuck that, slide an ace up your sleeve and cheat like a real player."
19-11-2018T02:08:10,Vatruvius,?
19-11-2018T02:08:26,Dadrobit,(Not that I cheat at Poker Nights myself mind you)
19-11-2018T02:08:42,Vatruvius,Where did poker come in?
19-11-2018T02:10:08,Dadrobit,"""you deal with the cards you got"""
19-11-2018T02:10:19,Vatruvius,:ptv-wondering:
19-11-2018T02:11:58,Bgrmystr2,"go ahead then, dadro, cheat at life"
19-11-2018T02:12:11,Bgrmystr2,"enable that cheat menu, enable infinite money and god mode"
19-11-2018T02:12:21,Bgrmystr2,"go right ahead, tell me how it goes. :ptv-laugh:"
19-11-2018T02:13:58,Dadrobit,"It's called ""spicing up your resume"" so you can get a job that doesn't pay like dogshit."
19-11-2018T02:14:23,Bgrmystr2,ain't cheating though
19-11-2018T02:14:36,Dadrobit,"Also, charisma. That shit will get you through 98% of everything."
19-11-2018T02:15:40,Vatruvius,Too bad I can't just apply skill points that charisma in real life...
19-11-2018T02:15:50,Vatruvius,to*
19-11-2018T02:16:08,Vatruvius,"Why ""that""? I have no idea where that came from."
19-11-2018T02:16:30,Dadrobit,"Only been actively working in voice over for a year-ish? Fuck it, I once narrated a game in 2010. I've now got nearly a decade of experience on my LinkedIn page."
19-11-2018T02:17:22,Vatruvius,"Even though I was a few unites away from my AS, I still put it on my resume."
19-11-2018T02:17:38,Vatruvius,Was going to get it at the end of the semester.
19-11-2018T02:18:27,Dadrobit,"Same. I technically only have ""certifications"" in audio engineering and sound design. You better believe they're listed as AS degrees though."
19-11-2018T02:19:10,Vatruvius,And now it is getting hard to stay awake in the chair...
19-11-2018T02:21:34,Vatruvius,"Okay, I am going to head of to bed, listen to some instrumental music, and think about my webcomic. Goodnight everyone! Goodnight Tom! :ptv-greetings:"
19-11-2018T02:21:40,Dadrobit,o/
19-11-2018T02:21:48,unsteddyphoenix,later
19-11-2018T02:25:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I return from movie time
19-11-2018T02:28:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems you’re discussing good ol fashioned fancy letterin

19-11-2018T03:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,..ok now I’m goin to bed 🛌
19-11-2018T04:58:52,Sifty,why is the webcomic called twokinds?
19-11-2018T04:58:59,Sifty,google will not tell me
19-11-2018T05:00:01,Bgrmystr2,because there's twokinds of people :P
19-11-2018T05:00:16,Bgrmystr2,normal people.. and people that just want to watch the world burn. :v
19-11-2018T05:01:07,Bgrmystr2,"I may or may not be pulling your leg, so you can take a guess which type of person I am."
19-11-2018T05:43:42,Sifty,I was sort of thinking about it along those lines
19-11-2018T05:43:52,Sifty,but there are more than 2 kinds of people in the comic
19-11-2018T05:44:13,Sifty,and maybe it was because of the fact that there's keidrans and humans
19-11-2018T05:44:21,Sifty,but that doesn't work either becuase there are also basitins
19-11-2018T05:51:13,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I don't think there's a general consensus
19-11-2018T05:52:00,Bgrmystr2,it probably was rooted in the idea of humans + keidran
19-11-2018T05:52:28,Bgrmystr2,looking at his comic he was going to do but stopped and made this one instead
19-11-2018T05:52:46,Bgrmystr2,"it was originally called twokinds, but now it's called The Halfkind"
19-11-2018T05:53:05,Bgrmystr2,the name probably just stuck
19-11-2018T05:53:43,Bgrmystr2,"it is also themed after trace and flora, hence the orange and blue"
19-11-2018T09:23:26,CommanderTrace,Hello:ptv-greetings:
19-11-2018T10:19:53,Dadrobit,"Late to the conversation. But an additional consideration is that originally, Keith was suppposed to return to the islands to find that he was the only Basitin left, making the ""TwoKinds"" as meaning there would be only Humans and Keidran on Mekkan."

19-11-2018T15:24:54,Sifty,he said get the sheets out of the wash
19-11-2018T15:24:56,Sifty,not out of the dry

19-11-2018T15:25:34,Sifty,what's an up take
19-11-2018T15:25:50,Sifty,oh wait
19-11-2018T15:25:52,Mippy,I rest my case
19-11-2018T15:25:53,Sifty,so he can put them into the dryer
19-11-2018T15:25:54,Sifty,right

19-11-2018T15:27:39,Sifty,that is good news
19-11-2018T15:27:41,Sifty,what happened?
19-11-2018T15:27:56,Mippy,Back pain
19-11-2018T15:28:17,Sifty,just in general or some kind of condition?
19-11-2018T15:29:41,Mippy,"Back problems run in my family. My grandma had them, my mum has them, I have them. It dose not help that I stand on a concrete floor all day and walk around with bowling balls on my chest."
19-11-2018T15:30:20,Mippy,"I probably shouldn’t use the drawing donkeys in class either, no back support"
19-11-2018T15:31:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been tempted to get a back brace for work
19-11-2018T15:31:30,Sifty,"shit, that sucks"
19-11-2018T15:31:41,SpazztasticKiwi,They hold your back and any weight you pick up
19-11-2018T15:32:18,Mippy,Hmmm...never thought of a brace. :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
19-11-2018T15:32:29,Sifty,yeah and have you asked about getting something to help with it
19-11-2018T15:32:31,Twokinds,I'm trying to figure out how drawing donkeys in class could hurt someone's back.
19-11-2018T15:32:45,Mippy,"Yeah, it dose Sifty, but I deal."
19-11-2018T15:33:08,Sifty,"I look up drawing donkeys and all I see is ""how to draw donkeys"""
19-11-2018T15:33:19,Twokinds,Is the back pain a disk thing? I've had family with that.
19-11-2018T15:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,So
19-11-2018T15:34:38,Mippy,It’s sitting that long without something to lean on that puts strain on my back. I also end up leaning forward on my work to get some relief. I’m fine in a chair.
19-11-2018T15:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera just fell off the bed
19-11-2018T15:34:57,Sifty,who's that
19-11-2018T15:35:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Cat
19-11-2018T15:35:27,Sifty,dumb cato
19-11-2018T15:36:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh he’s not dumb. He’s just a major derp
19-11-2018T15:37:27,Mippy,My mom has a deteriorating disks. I’ll have to look into the possibility that I inherited it. I seem to get everything else from her. I just haven’t before because going to the doctor causes a lot of anxiety and it was better to avoid it.
19-11-2018T15:37:49,Mippy,Kiwi’s cat is a derp
19-11-2018T15:38:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Hardcore derp
19-11-2018T15:39:06,Mippy,But derpy animals are major amusing
19-11-2018T15:39:15,Sifty,why would going to the doctor cause you anxiety ?
19-11-2018T15:41:01,Mippy,How should I know Sifty? It just did. Now that I’m meditating my “issues” I’m trying to catch up on the medical stuff I should have done years ago. Next up is the dentist
19-11-2018T15:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to hammer in my insurance so I can see about a dentist
19-11-2018T15:44:01,Sifty,alright well I hope when you get it checked out the worst will be behind you
19-11-2018T15:44:33,Mippy,My Little Mister probably needs eye surgery. He’s alive and active. Eating and drinking and stuff. The problem is that his eye seems to have popped out. We may have to get it removed before he claws it out.
19-11-2018T15:45:05,Sifty,jesus

19-11-2018T15:45:41,Sifty,shame it's not halloween anymore
19-11-2018T15:45:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I know someone whose dog scratched his eye. It had to be removed
19-11-2018T15:45:46,Mippy,I got insurance at work that is pretty good. I’m just waiting for the summer when I make more and don’t have school to pay for.
19-11-2018T15:47:29,Mippy,Turns out eye problems are common in hedgehogs. Males especially may lose an eye. They do well adaptation because they don’t see well anyway.
19-11-2018T15:48:04,SpazztasticKiwi,👁 “oh well. Didn’t use it anyway”
19-11-2018T15:48:16,Sifty,free food

19-11-2018T19:13:43,Twokinds,They were really wearing down in the middle. Color completely faded. I'm sure one day a hole would've been worn completely through them.
19-11-2018T19:14:31,Twokinds,So good to get something completely new finally.

19-11-2018T19:35:34,CrRAR,If it's good enough to put pharaohs to rest for eternity... must make for one hell of a sleep for us mere mortals.
19-11-2018T19:47:16,Bgrmystr2,"I highly doubt they made what we call ""Egyptian cotton"" way back then."

19-11-2018T20:29:20,Twokinds,lol
19-11-2018T20:30:10,Twokinds,What I do is use one of those fine-tooth fur brushes and a handheld vaccuum. More effective on fabric and don't have to spend an arm and leg on lint rollers.
19-11-2018T20:30:38,Twokinds,"But seriously, Holly is a cat fur factory."

19-11-2018T21:14:40,CrRAR,Sounds good... quite eeelusive. >.>
19-11-2018T21:14:50,RimaDraws,Sweet potato casserole is good
19-11-2018T21:15:43,RimaDraws,Probably tastes like that without the pecans
19-11-2018T21:15:50,CrRAR,mmm
19-11-2018T21:15:59,CrRAR,"haha, so much food talk already... the foodmagedon is nearly upon us! xD"

19-11-2018T21:17:45,RimaDraws,Yummy
19-11-2018T21:18:00,CrRAR,Is that the thing with bread crumbies on top?
19-11-2018T21:18:23,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s usually crumbled onions
19-11-2018T21:18:47,RimaDraws,Onions
19-11-2018T21:18:56,CrRAR,even better
19-11-2018T21:19:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I make that creeeeamy casserole
19-11-2018T21:19:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And then there’s the sugar cookies
19-11-2018T21:19:46,SpazztasticKiwi,And brownies
19-11-2018T21:20:00,RimaDraws,I can bake sugar cookies homemade
19-11-2018T21:20:15,RimaDraws,Like the Walmart ones only they taste better
19-11-2018T21:20:26,CrRAR,sugar cookies are the best
19-11-2018T21:20:42,CrRAR,Snickerdoodles if you want to be extra fancy~

19-11-2018T21:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,And cinnamon rolls
19-11-2018T21:22:41,CrRAR,never considered icing...
19-11-2018T21:22:44,CrRAR,but YES
19-11-2018T21:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Or icing dip
19-11-2018T21:23:02,CrRAR,✓✓✓
19-11-2018T21:23:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Or icing already on them and then milk

19-11-2018T22:26:43,RimaDraws,home finally
19-11-2018T22:56:48,RimaDraws,ill stream a bit but not much
19-11-2018T22:59:59,Vatruvius,Well this isn't nostalgic at all...
19-11-2018T23:02:11,RimaDraws,nostalgic?
19-11-2018T23:03:24,Vatruvius,"Well, most of my cousins are coming over tomorrow for Thanksgiving so I am setting up one of my old Xbox 360s so we can 4-player splitscreen play games and have fun. I assembled my first Xbox and put in my first game on it, Halo Reach..."
19-11-2018T23:03:32,Vatruvius,That was SO many years ago...
19-11-2018T23:04:09,Bgrmystr2,first xbox game Halo reach? hurts my soul
19-11-2018T23:04:38,Bgrmystr2,sounds fun though
19-11-2018T23:06:11,Vatruvius,"I mean, I must have been 12 at the time. I got it on Christmas right after it released. The Halo Reach Xbox and everything."
19-11-2018T23:06:59,Bgrmystr2,lol.. youngin :P
19-11-2018T23:07:20,Vatruvius,"Yes, I am quite young compared to all of you, but I am old enough to drink now so..."
19-11-2018T23:08:48,Vatruvius,"Given how old the game is, it still looks pretty good."
19-11-2018T23:09:57,Vatruvius,That 30 fps hurts though...
19-11-2018T23:10:02,Bgrmystr2,I was 17 something when the 360 first released.
19-11-2018T23:10:26,Bgrmystr2,"dunno when the halo reach xbox was out, though I never really cared for reach"
19-11-2018T23:10:36,Bgrmystr2,lacked so much
19-11-2018T23:10:49,Bgrmystr2,"was a solid game, just didn't live up to the namesake."
19-11-2018T23:11:43,Vatruvius,"Well no, how could it with Master Chief and all. But is was my first game and still a great experience. Technically I still have not played any of the games before Reach, but know of their story/lore."
19-11-2018T23:12:01,Bgrmystr2,then you're missing a lot
19-11-2018T23:12:05,Vatruvius,"Compared to 343s Halo games, so much better."
19-11-2018T23:12:20,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I don't think there's much difference"
19-11-2018T23:12:29,Bgrmystr2,I'd rank reach just about the same as the 343 games
19-11-2018T23:12:38,Vatruvius,"I have played Reach and Halo 4, I prefer Reach."
19-11-2018T23:13:10,Bgrmystr2,"but I've played thousands of hrs of the first game alone, fuckton of the 2nd and 3rd game"
19-11-2018T23:13:39,Vatruvius,"I can't rank Reach to the Halo games before it, I haven't played them."
19-11-2018T23:14:03,Bgrmystr2,they're worth picking up to play. they all work on the 360
19-11-2018T23:14:17,Bgrmystr2,the first game has an anniversary edition too
19-11-2018T23:14:41,Bgrmystr2,"gives some really interesting graphical changes, though it doesn't retain the detailed feel."
19-11-2018T23:14:46,Vatruvius,"I heard, perhaps I will since I have this thing up and running again."
19-11-2018T23:14:47,Bgrmystr2,just more oo shiney than anything else
19-11-2018T23:14:56,Vatruvius,Of ourse.
19-11-2018T23:15:00,Vatruvius,course*
19-11-2018T23:16:13,Bgrmystr2,"to be honest the very little that the anniversary changes in the campaign (a few missing weapons removed because ""balance"") it's not much to the amount they added for multiplayer + skulls"
19-11-2018T23:16:31,Bgrmystr2,so the anniversary is totally worth a grab
19-11-2018T23:16:57,Bgrmystr2,"2 and 3 for sure, ODST fills in some lore between 2 and 3"
19-11-2018T23:17:43,CommanderTrace,Good Night Tom see you

19-11-2018T23:17:51,Vatruvius,"I will certainly consider it, however, finding them will be interesting. Either there is still stocks of them not sold because of the new Xbox One, or I will have to look for used copies."
19-11-2018T23:17:51,Bgrmystr2,ah gnight
19-11-2018T23:17:57,Vatruvius,Goodnight Trace.
19-11-2018T23:18:04,CommanderTrace,thx
19-11-2018T23:18:15,Bgrmystr2,there should be stocks not sold for the 360
19-11-2018T23:18:22,Bgrmystr2,there always is at the stores around here
19-11-2018T23:18:32,Bgrmystr2,"and because it's such an old game, it should be fairly cheap"
19-11-2018T23:18:38,Bgrmystr2,shouldn't need to buy it used
19-11-2018T23:19:01,Vatruvius,Cheap stocking stuffers then? Alright!
19-11-2018T23:20:45,Bgrmystr2,yeah prettymuch. Anniversary is $23 https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Combat-Evolved-Anniversary-Xbox-360/dp/B0050SYY5E/
19-11-2018T23:21:21,Bgrmystr2,for a game that would give me almost as many hours as I played Diablo 2.. and it's linear as any other..
19-11-2018T23:21:24,Bgrmystr2,that's damn good
19-11-2018T23:22:25,Vatruvius,"Not as cheap as I would've thought, but certainly affordable."
19-11-2018T23:24:29,Dadrobit,Oof Diablo 2. Memories yo. Memories.
19-11-2018T23:24:34,Bgrmystr2,well yeah the game series is almost the only thing that sells the xbox one.
