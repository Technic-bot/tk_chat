09-06-2018T16:46:51,Vatruvius,"Okay, I cannot begin to explain to my parents what a furry is. They would not understand. This sketch, I would be forever micromanaged..."
09-06-2018T16:46:53,Combak,"Wait, you suggested the Therie thing?"
09-06-2018T16:46:54,TheDixieNutjob,someone shared with me a chair that is specifically made for people to sit like that

09-06-2018T16:48:24,Matth3w23,What happens if the next sketch is the bartender's view-point?
09-06-2018T16:48:24,Vatruvius,Why would you when you are so gifted...XD

09-06-2018T16:49:26,ZoopBoopLoop,"OH what if it's Nat who sees the butt, but Zen senses it from her perspective"
09-06-2018T16:49:31,unsteddyphoenix,"damn, 4 drinks? she has the highest keidran alcohol toleranec in the world"

09-06-2018T17:08:00,Tharkis,We are Voltage over Current !
09-06-2018T17:08:00,MuonNeutrino,"particularly because keidran are only fertile after they've been in heat, so if she can't go into heat that's basically that"

09-06-2018T20:48:12,Ordithus,Not enough Sealeens.  My suggestion was in the first round and didn't do so well
09-06-2018T20:48:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, I never asked - how was Der Biergarten"
09-06-2018T20:49:10,BadFoMo,How was what?

09-06-2018T20:52:25,FenceEqualizer,True enough. Though it's usually harder to get the minor characters to win.
09-06-2018T20:53:11,unsteddyphoenix,Unless theyre background characters that have never talked
09-06-2018T20:53:16,unsteddyphoenix,Then it's pretty easy~
09-06-2018T20:53:36,Ordithus,"Hey, now, Therie has done all the talking with her eyes.  And her butt."
09-06-2018T20:53:49,FenceEqualizer,I call exception to the rule.

09-06-2018T21:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Impressing the dad’s hard enough. Try a tiger dad
09-06-2018T21:07:17,Ordithus,You worried about tiger dad?  I'd be worried about tiger momma
