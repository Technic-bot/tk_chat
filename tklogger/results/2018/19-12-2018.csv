19-12-2018T13:42:48,CrimsonQuill,"I had a really nice morning-I decided to draw some art of Kessah from Hunters of Salamanstra in Halo Armour. I expected to muck things up, because I never really focus on drawing and obsess over the end."
19-12-2018T13:43:00,CrimsonQuill,"This time though, i decided to see where the pencil took me"
19-12-2018T13:43:12,CrimsonQuill,Result: I actually drew something well!
19-12-2018T13:43:24,CrimsonQuill,Now to colour it in. That'll be fun.
19-12-2018T13:44:33,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-lynnsmile:
19-12-2018T13:46:28,TerraTheWizard,nice
19-12-2018T13:47:47,CrimsonQuill,"I'm thinking she'd be on Raine's fireteam-given that Raine has gone to Halo, and she and Kessah have appeared together, it seemed like a nice choice."
19-12-2018T13:48:16,CrimsonQuill,"Next up, Tom, you're going in a seamoth, along with your brother and Jacksepticeye!"
19-12-2018T13:48:26,CrimsonQuill,I think I'll put a Reaper behind you three...
19-12-2018T13:55:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I can imagine Mark in an underwater craft
19-12-2018T13:56:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Theyd have to put him in unconscious. No way he‚Äôd go voluntarily
19-12-2018T13:56:34,Xexanoth,that's what the drugs are for
19-12-2018T13:57:17,CrimsonQuill,"Well, considering Mark, Jack and Tom have all played Subnautica, I can imagine Mark panicking in the Craft, Jack looking for the tech, and Tom just sitting in wide-eyed wonder."
19-12-2018T13:57:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not even sure if Jack would go
19-12-2018T13:57:33,CrimsonQuill,"He would, perhaps."
19-12-2018T13:57:48,CrimsonQuill,Just three people I really like in Seamoths.
19-12-2018T13:58:16,CrimsonQuill,There's something wrong with me... I keep listening to Orchestral Remixes of my favourite Undertale songs.
19-12-2018T13:58:30,CrimsonQuill,The music is in my head-so amazing!
19-12-2018T13:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,He didn‚Äôt make a submarine called the USS Fuck the Ocean but he wasn‚Äôt thrilled with exploring the deep
19-12-2018T13:58:56,CrimsonQuill,Mark? I prefer his Big Box Barry and Bubblebutt.
19-12-2018T13:59:14,CrimsonQuill,"And as for Jack, Sally the Seamoth has always been my favouruite."
19-12-2018T13:59:28,CrimsonQuill,"I don't know what Tom called his, but I could ask, or make a name up"
19-12-2018T13:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked he actually tried the ‚Äúbefriend a reaper‚Äù bit
19-12-2018T13:59:35,Twokinds,Me in real life subnautica would just be me continually gathering titanium in the safe shallows to create more and more walls between me and the ocean.
19-12-2018T13:59:47,CrimsonQuill,"That scared, huh, Tom?"
19-12-2018T13:59:50,CrimsonQuill,Me too.
19-12-2018T13:59:59,CrimsonQuill,What did you call your Seamoth?
19-12-2018T14:00:15,Twokinds,Uh... I don't remember. I'd have to boot it up and check
19-12-2018T14:00:56,CrimsonQuill,Oooh...listening to a Spear of Justice Orchestral remix...epic.
19-12-2018T14:01:05,CrimsonQuill,I love music...
19-12-2018T14:01:35,CrimsonQuill,Subnautica's is really good too-especially the Safe Shallows suite and 'Abandon Ship'.
19-12-2018T14:01:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah Tom you know you can befriend a stalker shark and a reaper
19-12-2018T14:01:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Just offer them a peeper
19-12-2018T14:01:59,Twokinds,When the dlc comes out I'll play in vr
19-12-2018T14:03:09,CrimsonQuill,"Well, got to go-showing my Sister some stuff"
19-12-2018T14:03:12,CrimsonQuill,Bye
19-12-2018T14:03:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I like subnautica. As much as I wouldn‚Äôt be out in the ocean myself I‚Äôm not scared of it - more I know I‚Äôm not a fan of what‚Äôs in it
19-12-2018T14:03:18,Twokinds,bye

19-12-2018T14:04:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve already been spoiled on what the DLC reapers look like
19-12-2018T14:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Just put me six feet under before putting one of those things in front of me

19-12-2018T14:08:20,Twokinds,Oh right
19-12-2018T14:08:30,Twokinds,I named my Seamoth the Seaboss
19-12-2018T14:09:27,Twokinds,And Prawnsuit was Prawnstar
19-12-2018T14:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,punny
19-12-2018T14:10:33,RimaDraws,sounds fun
19-12-2018T14:11:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder why jack didn‚Äôt call his the seaboss
19-12-2018T14:11:22,RimaDraws,what is subnautica?
19-12-2018T14:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Seaworld on planet ‚Äúnot even if you paid me‚Äù
19-12-2018T14:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Wanna see a reaper leviathan?
19-12-2018T14:12:31,RimaDraws,nah i can look at the stuff on steam if that's what is in it
19-12-2018T14:12:42,Twokinds,Subnautica is a great game.
19-12-2018T14:13:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs great. The reaper‚Äôs my favorite. I just really want to see the winter part
19-12-2018T14:13:52,RimaDraws,i may give subnautica a try
19-12-2018T14:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And if the ‚Äúspoiler‚Äù I saw is actually the winter reapers
19-12-2018T14:14:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, do you have a cuddlefish yet"
19-12-2018T14:15:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I ever actually manage to get me a set up to play the game, my main priority is going to be finding a reaper egg and building an aquarium"
19-12-2018T14:23:31,Mippy,Yay! Just got my TK package üì¶
19-12-2018T14:24:51,RimaDraws,your comic??
19-12-2018T14:25:03,Mippy,I don‚Äôt have a empty frame right now so Raine is just sort of purched on top of one of my movie shelves.
19-12-2018T14:25:21,Mippy,"Comic, print, and sweater"
19-12-2018T14:25:23,RimaDraws,next time there is a book release ill get the print
19-12-2018T14:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,By ‚Äúsweater‚Äù - is there a sweater or did you get the hoodie
19-12-2018T14:30:29,RimaDraws,hoodie i think

19-12-2018T14:34:35,RimaDraws,never heard of them
19-12-2018T14:34:40,Mippy,A hoodie is nothing more then a sweater with a hood.
19-12-2018T14:35:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan plays games like mark on YouTube - Phil is a less-censored news anchor
19-12-2018T14:35:57,Mippy,Ethan is adorable
19-12-2018T14:36:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"My favorite PhilyD shirt is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be Stupid, Stupid‚Äù"

19-12-2018T14:36:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan is precious
19-12-2018T14:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Phil makes the news fun
19-12-2018T14:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs brought his sons on camera once at least
19-12-2018T14:37:04,RimaDraws,oh he has kids
19-12-2018T14:37:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Two boys

19-12-2018T14:37:28,RimaDraws,5 years older than me
19-12-2018T14:37:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Just had his birthday I think last month
19-12-2018T14:38:06,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs mentioned mark jack and Ethan when they‚Äôve been related to a story
19-12-2018T14:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I like him alot. He does some good stuff
19-12-2018T14:39:28,Mippy,Did anyone here buy the official Markiplier rock? Wonderful Mark...literally selling rocks to his fans.
19-12-2018T14:39:35,SpazztasticKiwi,No
19-12-2018T14:39:37,RimaDraws,nope

19-12-2018T14:40:20,SpazztasticKiwi,He signed a few of those rocks at PAX
19-12-2018T14:40:42,Mippy,XD The calendar. Watching Mark torture himself signing them all was fun
19-12-2018T14:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,he dug his grave
19-12-2018T14:42:00,SpazztasticKiwi,and he dug his way out
19-12-2018T14:42:03,Mippy,"Well, I guess we now know how much Mark‚Äôs butt is worth"
19-12-2018T14:42:12,TerraTheWizard,so i lost like 20 minutes of chat because win10 decided it needed to update while i was out
19-12-2018T14:42:19,TerraTheWizard,so i came back to toms submarine names
19-12-2018T14:42:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Not something I want to think about honestly
19-12-2018T14:42:36,RimaDraws,o.o
19-12-2018T14:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn‚Äôt even a fan of when he stripped at his Atlanta show
19-12-2018T14:43:49,Mippy,:ctwokinds-RaineEep: He did that...part of me is sad I missed that

19-12-2018T14:44:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I just sat there like ‚Äúkeep going and I‚Äôm walking out‚Äù
19-12-2018T14:45:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I cheered for him, sure but"
19-12-2018T14:46:12,Mippy,Winter makes me want to hibernate

19-12-2018T16:53:14,CrimsonQuill,It does cause quite the bother when they tear.

19-12-2018T17:00:58,MrMongMong,"It took a while, but it was fun."
19-12-2018T17:01:14,CrimsonQuill,I did it with my aunt.
19-12-2018T17:01:18,CrimsonQuill,It wasn't fun.

19-12-2018T17:01:34,MrMongMong,I always liked bashing things with hammers.
19-12-2018T17:01:41,CrimsonQuill,And some couldn't be taken out at all.
19-12-2018T17:02:07,CrimsonQuill,"I did hammer one or two, but my aunt took care of the majority, because my aim is woeful."
19-12-2018T17:02:22,MrMongMong,You could paint them over and hope no one ever decides to run their hand along it...
19-12-2018T17:02:47,SpazztasticKiwi,If they do it‚Äôs their own fault
19-12-2018T17:03:19,MrMongMong,Yes *Guiltily looks at fence that is MADE of rusty nails*
19-12-2018T17:03:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna go get tacos
19-12-2018T17:03:35,CrimsonQuill,Not going to happen. Not with cattle in the yard.
19-12-2018T17:03:53,CrimsonQuill,"Plus, the fence'll probably be replaced in a few years."
19-12-2018T17:05:41,MrMongMong,"You could replace it with a trench. Then there will be no nails, as well as a way to catch thieves in the night."
19-12-2018T17:06:16,CrimsonQuill,"Mate, have you SEEN how good cattle are at escaping through fences?"
19-12-2018T17:06:35,MrMongMong,You could make the trench bigger?
19-12-2018T17:06:40,MrMongMong,:ok_hand:
19-12-2018T17:06:41,CrimsonQuill,No.
19-12-2018T17:06:45,CrimsonQuill,Fences.
19-12-2018T17:06:47,MrMongMong,Ok... :(
19-12-2018T17:06:59,CrimsonQuill,"They'd hop in the ditch, and then out."
19-12-2018T17:07:09,MrMongMong,You could make it 3 meters deep.
19-12-2018T17:07:24,MrMongMong,That will have *definetly* no side effects.
19-12-2018T17:07:34,CrimsonQuill,How to get it out-that's the problem.
19-12-2018T17:07:49,CrimsonQuill,"They're heavy, and we don't have lifting gear on demand."
19-12-2018T17:08:18,CrimsonQuill,"No, we make decent fences-ones which coop in even the most persistent escapologist."
19-12-2018T17:08:27,CrimsonQuill,"Or at least, my Aunt does."
19-12-2018T17:08:35,CrimsonQuill,I'm not with her most of the time.
19-12-2018T17:09:19,SpazztasticKiwi,You know with the way cattle‚Äôs joints are they can go up stairs but now down
19-12-2018T17:09:23,SpazztasticKiwi,not
19-12-2018T17:09:34,CrimsonQuill,yep
19-12-2018T17:10:09,CrimsonQuill,*YAWN!* *Nyup nyup*...I need to go to bed...
19-12-2018T17:10:21,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to the land of nod.
19-12-2018T17:10:32,CrimsonQuill,Up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire.
19-12-2018T17:10:38,CrimsonQuill,"In other words, Goodnight all."

19-12-2018T17:23:02,RimaDraws,Hi terra
19-12-2018T17:40:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you guys seen the Christmas dresses at Walmart
19-12-2018T17:48:00,TerraTheWizard,nope
19-12-2018T17:52:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Only one I like is the red one but they‚Äôre so wide in the waist and short
19-12-2018T18:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,What‚Äôs Mark‚Äôs obsession with picking Lucy up
19-12-2018T18:24:35,MrMongMong,Who wouldn't want to lift a blob of floof?
19-12-2018T18:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Those who value their spine
19-12-2018T18:26:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Good first video for him to show though. Fluff doggo. Wasn‚Äôt as fond of the howling after
19-12-2018T18:29:32,MrMongMong,Floofs above spines!
19-12-2018T18:29:44,MrMongMong,Spines are for the weak!
19-12-2018T18:33:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"That dog likely weighs more than I do. If I want to be crushed, I‚Äôll find a quicker way"
19-12-2018T18:38:20,ElvenHunter84,I would love to see some kind of drawing challenge between Mark and Tom
19-12-2018T18:38:29,ElvenHunter84,maybe a Draw your Tweets style thing
19-12-2018T18:38:48,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôd bee moot point considering Mark has said he can‚Äôt draw
19-12-2018T18:39:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"We‚Äôll see what he does, but Tom doesn‚Äôt like cameras so we‚Äôll likely just see stuff with their mother"

19-12-2018T19:06:41,RimaDraws,so kiwi i got a question if you have a female cat
19-12-2018T19:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea. Kiwi‚Äôs a girl
19-12-2018T19:07:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera‚Äôs the boy
19-12-2018T19:07:19,RimaDraws,well my cat winter is yowling to go outside
19-12-2018T19:07:48,RimaDraws,does that mean she's going into heat? because i looked it up and it says they will try to go outside if they are indoor cat
19-12-2018T19:08:28,RimaDraws,this started yesterday and she almost got away
19-12-2018T19:08:39,SpazztasticKiwi,She could be
19-12-2018T19:08:59,RimaDraws,i mean that's all she's done is small yowls here and there
19-12-2018T19:09:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Check for discharge and if she starts hollering throughout the house incessantly, she definitely is"
19-12-2018T19:10:06,RimaDraws,okay i will thank you. i havent had a female cat in years
19-12-2018T19:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Lock your doors and close the windows
19-12-2018T19:10:48,SpazztasticKiwi,No problem. I got Kiwi fixed since her growth is stunted and having kittens would‚Äôve likely killed her
19-12-2018T19:10:52,RimaDraws,yea i looked out last night and qrow got out so i had to get him. when i got him she got out. thankfully not far or long because i got her a couple mins after
19-12-2018T19:10:57,RimaDraws,yea she keeps howling
19-12-2018T19:11:19,RimaDraws,she's also been playing with qrow a lot lately (thankfully he is fixed)
19-12-2018T19:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Something else you might need to know - female cats can spray
19-12-2018T19:12:47,RimaDraws,oh boy...i didn't know that...
19-12-2018T19:12:52,SpazztasticKiwi,She may do so if she‚Äôs going into heat
19-12-2018T19:13:20,SpazztasticKiwi,A vet could feel for sure. And it‚Äôd be advisable to get her fixed after it‚Äôs done or now if she‚Äôs not
19-12-2018T19:13:25,SpazztasticKiwi,tell
19-12-2018T19:13:42,RimaDraws,yea i need to try to get her fixed asap
19-12-2018T19:13:59,RimaDraws,even if qrow cant do anything she gets out another male could
19-12-2018T19:14:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi‚Äôs was only about $100 and they gave her shots too
19-12-2018T19:14:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"And, while she‚Äôs in heat, she will attract toms like ants to sugar"
19-12-2018T19:15:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Watch the yard, make sure none try sneaking in, and keep Qrow close. Fixed or not, they‚Äôll try fighting him"
19-12-2018T19:16:00,RimaDraws,oh dear.....i need to get her taken care of as soon as possible. this is helpful thank you so much.
19-12-2018T19:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,üëçüèª
19-12-2018T20:00:02,MrMongMong,The proper way to deal with a moody hormonal creature is to lock it in its room and don't open the door regardless of what you hear.
19-12-2018T20:00:28,MrMongMong,(I would make a terrible parent...)
19-12-2018T20:07:41,RimaDraws,i cant lock her away that is just terrible to me
19-12-2018T20:46:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Then she‚Äôd just tear stuff up trying to get out
19-12-2018T21:09:08,MrMongMong,You could lock her in with you?
19-12-2018T21:09:20,MrMongMong,Or maybe cat-leashes!
