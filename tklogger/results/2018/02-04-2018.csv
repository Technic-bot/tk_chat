02-04-2018T00:23:21,Twokinds,Woah
02-04-2018T00:23:31,Twokinds,Lightning just struck so close it rattled my house
02-04-2018T00:25:03,Bgrmystr2,D;
02-04-2018T00:25:30,Dadrobit,Fun fun fun
02-04-2018T00:27:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Dogs start barking?
02-04-2018T00:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Boom boom üí•
02-04-2018T00:32:11,Twokinds,Oddly enough the dogs didn't even react.
02-04-2018T00:32:39,Twokinds,Typical. They bark like mad if I step on a floorboard too hard.
02-04-2018T00:33:07,Twokinds,"Giant explosion? Eh, whatevs"
02-04-2018T00:33:38,Dadrobit,"""Well, guess this is how I go"" -Dogs probably"
02-04-2018T00:36:23,unsteddyphoenix,What about Holly?
02-04-2018T00:36:32,unsteddyphoenix,My cat would always hide under beds
02-04-2018T00:36:41,unsteddyphoenix,Or whatever was avaliable
02-04-2018T00:43:20,TorqueEmUp,Man what pussycats! Afraid of a little thunder. :P
02-04-2018T00:44:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Murderer in the house? Wagging tails all around. Creaky floorboard? Sound the alarm!
02-04-2018T00:45:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Our dogs bark at leaves falling in the yard, so I think I have you beat there"
02-04-2018T00:45:31,TorqueEmUp,"Cats be like ""IDGAF leave me alone."""
02-04-2018T00:51:43,SpazztasticKiwi,We don‚Äôt have a bunch of little yappy breeds though
02-04-2018T00:53:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Two big breeds and a medium breed. The fourth dog is barely 4 pounds, but he‚Äôs not a barker. - he‚Äôs a chicken"
02-04-2018T00:54:59,Vatruvius,I just got a really good sketch idea...how do you guys feel about a Twokinds' Alien Isolation?
02-04-2018T00:59:39,TorqueEmUp,Little ankle biters i call 'em
02-04-2018T01:01:15,TorqueEmUp,"My ex had a long-haired chihuahua. Those dogs REALLY hate strangers, just something about the breed, they get really attached to one human, and they hate most others."
02-04-2018T01:01:48,TorqueEmUp,They eventually warm up to people they are around a lot.
02-04-2018T01:02:08,WIPKING,My dog died
02-04-2018T01:02:16,TorqueEmUp,So it got used to me fairly quick.
02-04-2018T01:02:29,WIPKING,Rip dog
02-04-2018T01:02:41,WIPKING,April late fools ha
02-04-2018T01:02:53,WIPKING,I dont have a dog
02-04-2018T01:04:28,Vatruvius,That was a bit of a dark April Fools.
02-04-2018T01:04:39,Vatruvius,Really does not work in a type only chat.
02-04-2018T01:05:10,WIPKING,Yea well i didnt do anything onapril fools so i did that
02-04-2018T01:05:29,WIPKING,Back to watching vanoss till 2 am
02-04-2018T01:06:08,Vatruvius,lol...I am watching Vanoss right now.
02-04-2018T01:07:04,WIPKING,"TOM if you were choosing some sketches right now, what would you choose, like what type of art would you do?"
02-04-2018T01:08:43,Vatruvius,Only the best art.
02-04-2018T01:08:50,Vatruvius,"""D"
02-04-2018T01:09:08,Vatruvius,That was suppose to be this :D but that works for some reason.
02-04-2018T01:10:13,WIPKING,@Twokinds What im trying to say is im going to suggest somthing next month and i would like to know what you like to do.
02-04-2018T01:10:33,Twokinds,That's cheating!
02-04-2018T01:10:38,WIPKING,Ok
02-04-2018T01:11:04,WIPKING,I'll just go with anything modern then
02-04-2018T01:11:18,Dadrobit,It has to be #QualitySuggestion.
02-04-2018T01:11:23,Vatruvius,lol...Tom only picks the best of suggestions.
02-04-2018T01:11:25,WIPKING,I knoe
02-04-2018T01:11:43,Vatruvius,Anything Tom picks is a quality suggestion.
02-04-2018T01:12:06,TorqueEmUp,Or just something he wants to draw
02-04-2018T01:12:06,Vatruvius,It was just a suggestion before...but it became a quality one when Tom picked it.
02-04-2018T01:12:11,WIPKING,I want to see some colored steam punk
02-04-2018T01:13:04,Dadrobit,So much for doing it yoursel huh.
02-04-2018T01:13:22,WIPKING,Well i had troble going to school this morning so im going do it later over time
02-04-2018T01:13:37,WIPKING,Plus i should have been asleep 3 hours ago
02-04-2018T01:13:53,WIPKING,So good night
02-04-2018T01:14:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom‚Äôs stuff = good stuff
02-04-2018T01:14:48,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt take that out of context
02-04-2018T01:15:33,Vatruvius,Too late Kiwi...you made it go out of context.
02-04-2018T01:15:38,unsteddyphoenix,Tom has the  :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:*[good stuff]
02-04-2018T01:16:12,Vatruvius,Perfect.
02-04-2018T01:16:19,WIPKING,@Twokinds i was reading the comic where keith trys to get rid of the helmet and in one part flora takes it from him then changes into a flashback right before keith has the helmet back in his hands. Just thought you should know....
02-04-2018T01:17:15,Vatruvius,That is part of the story I believe...Keith takes the helmet back. Also...Tom is never wrong.
02-04-2018T01:17:49,Dadrobit,Spellchecker would disagree lol.
02-04-2018T01:18:36,WIPKING,Ok my film teacher would give me a big fat F if somthing like that was in my film
02-04-2018T01:18:46,Vatruvius,Spellchecker is part of Tom's tool box. His end work is never wrong Dadrobit.
02-04-2018T01:19:01,Dadrobit,Delayed correctness.
02-04-2018T01:19:12,Vatruvius,Well...you have more creative liberties when not trying to please a teacher.
02-04-2018T01:19:21,Dadrobit,Alternative correctness.
02-04-2018T01:19:31,Vatruvius,lol
02-04-2018T01:19:34,Twokinds,The translation matrix that interprets what all the characters are saying sometimes gets it wrong
02-04-2018T01:19:49,WIPKING,"üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™ i tired af night, havent seen matrix"
02-04-2018T01:19:58,Vatruvius,Goodnight.
02-04-2018T01:20:48,Vatruvius,Good thing he did not see that movie...otherwise he would now of the real world we live in and that all of this is just...the matrix! Dun...dun...da!
02-04-2018T01:20:57,Vatruvius,know*
02-04-2018T01:21:38,Vatruvius,Have you played Alien Isolation Tom?
02-04-2018T01:21:41,WIPKING,"Vanoss keeps on referring too ""wake up neo"" stuff"
02-04-2018T01:21:54,WIPKING,I dont like it
02-04-2018T01:22:03,Vatruvius,It is all in good fun.
02-04-2018T01:22:07,Vatruvius,Makes sense in the movie too.
02-04-2018T01:22:19,WIPKING,Not when you havent seen it
02-04-2018T01:22:29,Dadrobit,There is no spoon
02-04-2018T01:22:36,Vatruvius,^
02-04-2018T01:23:00,WIPKING,üòê i just need to leave instead of lurking
02-04-2018T01:23:08,Vatruvius,When I do not get a reference I either look it up or don't care. I do not get hung up on it.
02-04-2018T01:23:13,Vatruvius,Yes you do.
02-04-2018T01:23:20,WIPKING,Lol bye
02-04-2018T01:41:23,Vatruvius,I have been going through the x20 videos of the streams @Twokinds and it appears you have not posted the Keidrified Maren and Sythe sketch from the 2017.09.10 sketch stream.
02-04-2018T01:43:05,Vatruvius,Scratch that...found it!
02-04-2018T02:02:26,Dadrobit,"That's not Tom doing the uploading, it's iliar."
02-04-2018T02:03:13,Vatruvius,I know iliar uploads the videos...I was couldn't find a sketch and thought he did not post it. I found it though.
02-04-2018T02:03:31,Vatruvius,just*
02-04-2018T02:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I just watched a guy purposely put his arm in a bear trap
02-04-2018T02:08:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no words
02-04-2018T02:09:06,Vatruvius,What?! Why?! Did he want to break his arm?
02-04-2018T02:10:14,SpazztasticKiwi,He wanted to know what it was like
02-04-2018T02:10:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"As far as I gathered from it, anyway"
02-04-2018T02:10:38,Vatruvius,Very painful...I can tell you that much.
02-04-2018T02:11:05,Vatruvius,Why is the Earth plagued with such idiots?! WHY?
02-04-2018T02:11:56,Vatruvius,Soon he will want to know what it is like to get shot. Lose a limb? Break a rib.
02-04-2018T02:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I worry about some people‚Äôs intelligence
02-04-2018T02:15:10,Vatruvius,I worry about the lack of some people's intelligence.
02-04-2018T02:16:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna try going on to bed
02-04-2018T02:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Night chat - night Tom
02-04-2018T02:16:29,Twokinds,Don't let the beartraps bite
02-04-2018T02:19:08,Vatruvius,lol
02-04-2018T02:22:06,Vatruvius,Not sure if you saw earlier...but did you ever play Alien Isolation Tom?
02-04-2018T02:23:27,Dadrobit,Holy 1984 Batman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo
02-04-2018T02:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well, Bagheera‚Äôs been nomming on my arm periodically. That count?"
02-04-2018T02:24:44,Twokinds,I have not played Alien Isolation
02-04-2018T02:26:06,Vatruvius,Hmm...well I recommend it. I ask because I have a sketch suggestion about the game but not really...it could be any game for what I would suggest.
02-04-2018T02:27:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"That reminds me of my question: have you ever seen up tarrot card before, Tom?"
02-04-2018T02:29:06,Twokinds,?
02-04-2018T02:29:07,Vatruvius,That is a little weird Dadrobit but it is a bunch of news station owned by one company. Also...as for the whole fake news thing...that has not changed ever.
02-04-2018T02:29:18,Twokinds,Have I seen tarrot cards?
02-04-2018T02:29:19,Vatruvius,With you there Tom...what are you talking about Kiwi?
02-04-2018T02:30:32,Twokinds,I know what tarrot cards are
02-04-2018T02:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,but have you ever seen up them
02-04-2018T02:31:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Fortune telling cards, Vat"
02-04-2018T02:31:32,Twokinds,I've never had my fortune told with tarrot cards before.
02-04-2018T02:32:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"I used to read them. Not well, but I still have a deck"
02-04-2018T02:32:22,SpazztasticKiwi,What I was thinking about was how some of the characters match up with some of the cards in the deck personality wise
02-04-2018T02:32:38,Vatruvius,I do not think I have ever had my fortune told.
02-04-2018T02:33:28,Dadrobit,I have no problem with news stations being owned by a parent company. My problem is that they are then so blatently forcing an agenda instead of doing actual reporting on news.
02-04-2018T02:33:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Be wary if you ever do. Investing too much into your fortune or thinking about it too hard isn‚Äôt good
02-04-2018T02:34:03,Dadrobit,"I don't care what agenda they're pushing, just the fact that they're so openly, unrepentantly doing it"
02-04-2018T02:34:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Talk about a side quest conversation
02-04-2018T02:34:48,Vatruvius,lol
02-04-2018T02:34:58,Vatruvius,I watched the video he linked above.
02-04-2018T02:35:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was just curious to if there was a request to make a character into a tarot card likeness, you‚Äôd know what‚Äôs being talked about"
02-04-2018T02:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,But it may not translate well
02-04-2018T02:36:47,Twokinds,I can always look it up if I don't know what it looks like.
02-04-2018T02:36:57,Twokinds,That's what I usually do with references I don't know.
02-04-2018T02:37:41,unsteddyphoenix,Its good that the internet exists
02-04-2018T02:37:44,unsteddyphoenix,For such problems
02-04-2018T02:37:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"That‚Äôs the thing. Tarot cards vary greatly, and it depends on the interpreter and subject what results from a reading"
02-04-2018T02:38:20,Twokinds,Then I probably might have trouble.
02-04-2018T02:38:32,unsteddyphoenix,I think I have some
02-04-2018T02:38:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Despite the similarities that Trace has with the fool card, it‚Äôs likely not a good match"
02-04-2018T02:39:10,unsteddyphoenix,My friend bought them then discovered they were against his religion
02-04-2018T02:39:16,unsteddyphoenix,So I got some :D
02-04-2018T02:39:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"I read them. Again, not well, but as an exploratory thing"
02-04-2018T02:40:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thinking too hard or investing too much in a reading is what gets you in trouble, not the actual reading"
02-04-2018T02:42:26,Vatruvius,Yeah...now that I think more on it I specifically picked Alien Isolation for the suggestion because it would work perfectly for this one mechanic of the game.
02-04-2018T02:43:28,Vatruvius,I was kinda going for the whole VR thing like with the Yarn Simulator...
02-04-2018T02:46:32,Vatruvius,Wow...it got late fast. I have to get up in 6ish hours...goodnight everyone!
02-04-2018T02:46:52,Dadrobit,night
02-04-2018T02:51:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Night
02-04-2018T02:52:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm tired, I‚Äôm bored, and for some reason, I don‚Äôt feel I can fall asleep"
02-04-2018T02:52:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though the saying is if you can‚Äôt fall asleep, it‚Äôs because someone‚Äôs thinking about you"
02-04-2018T03:00:09,Twokinds,I'm waiting for my bed to preheat
02-04-2018T03:02:13,Bigboi182,"Ah jeez, I'm late!"
02-04-2018T03:02:32,Bigboi182,"Like, REALLY late."
02-04-2018T03:02:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta put Tom in the oven for 8 hours till crispy
02-04-2018T03:03:29,Bigboi182,Then garnish with a paintbrush.
02-04-2018T03:03:40,Bigboi182,Or a tablet.
02-04-2018T03:03:44,Bigboi182,You decide.
02-04-2018T03:04:24,Bgrmystr2,Garnish with paintablet.
02-04-2018T03:04:26,Bgrmystr2,Brush on the side.
02-04-2018T03:04:38,SpazztasticKiwi,You forgot to turn every 2 hours for an even coat
02-04-2018T03:05:00,Bgrmystr2,what kind of shitty oven are you using that you need to turn it?
02-04-2018T03:05:02,Bgrmystr2,xd
02-04-2018T03:05:15,Bgrmystr2,only the BEST auto-rotating cookers
02-04-2018T03:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Today on chat: how to casually discuss roasting the artist
02-04-2018T03:05:26,SpazztasticKiwi,In an actual oven
02-04-2018T03:05:27,Bigboi182,With guests!
02-04-2018T03:05:32,Bgrmystr2,LOL
02-04-2018T03:05:40,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
02-04-2018T03:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Lemon pepper seasoning, anyone?"
02-04-2018T03:06:03,Bigboi182,I knew i couldn't make this stream.
02-04-2018T03:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Or is it more of a bbq?
02-04-2018T03:06:20,Bigboi182,I was thinking ranch dressing.
02-04-2018T03:06:29,Dadrobit,"You rotate the artist vertically 180 degrees so that both sides roast evenly within the juices, otherwise half of it will be too dry."
02-04-2018T03:06:47,Bgrmystr2,"such an inferior cooker, dadro"
02-04-2018T03:06:55,Dadrobit,GOML
02-04-2018T03:06:55,Bgrmystr2,why'd you buy that one
02-04-2018T03:06:59,Bgrmystr2,:u
02-04-2018T03:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Great. Now he won‚Äôt want to meet any of us in real life
02-04-2018T03:07:04,Bigboi182,Wow
02-04-2018T03:07:09,Bigboi182,Indeed.
02-04-2018T03:07:36,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know what goml means xD
02-04-2018T03:07:38,Bigboi182,I'm actually near the west coast right now.
02-04-2018T03:07:40,Dadrobit,Remind me to never eat any of Bgr's dry ass food.
02-04-2018T03:07:49,Bigboi182,XD Dad
02-04-2018T03:07:50,Dadrobit,Get On My Level.
02-04-2018T03:08:06,Bgrmystr2,"haha, stop cookin with a garbage cooker that doesn't rotate by itself :P"
02-04-2018T03:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought it was an oven
02-04-2018T03:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs too many cooks in the kitchen
02-04-2018T03:08:44,Dadrobit,Oven cooked in a pan so that you don't lose any of the flavor.
02-04-2018T03:09:16,Bigboi182,Hah... Too Many Cooks...
02-04-2018T03:09:17,Dadrobit,"Or go ahead and spitroast it and get your inferior taste, your choice."
02-04-2018T03:09:48,Bgrmystr2,xD hey if you wanna babysit it and manually rotate the thing
02-04-2018T03:10:02,Bgrmystr2,instead of buying a cooker that can do it all automatically
02-04-2018T03:10:11,Bgrmystr2,like an industrial one or somethin
02-04-2018T03:10:14,Bgrmystr2,go right ahead
02-04-2018T03:10:17,Dadrobit,"Oh no! I had to attend to my food once over the course of an hour, how terrible."
02-04-2018T03:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"In the end, I think I‚Äôll pass on the cannibalism"
02-04-2018T03:11:49,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, god forbid you actually get a #QualityOven that cooks the way you would cook it without you babysitting the food"
02-04-2018T03:12:20,Dadrobit,God forbid you put any effort into making a #QualityMeal that actually tastes good.
02-04-2018T03:12:39,Bgrmystr2,"because it wouldn't, yeah? xD okay"
02-04-2018T03:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you guys still thinking Tom looks good enough to eat or are you actually discussing ovens and their quality?
02-04-2018T03:12:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Wait.
02-04-2018T03:12:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Bad wording
02-04-2018T03:12:58,Bigboi182,"OK, this just went from literally roasting tom to roasting each other..."
02-04-2018T03:13:01,Dadrobit,"But hey, let all the juices just drip off to the bottom of your oven, I'm sure that piece of metal will taste great."
02-04-2018T03:13:13,Bigboi182,And debating about ovens...
02-04-2018T03:13:15,Bgrmystr2,"Lol kiwi, All I can think of is those bigass rotating pizza cookers."
02-04-2018T03:13:21,Bigboi182,XD
02-04-2018T03:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Walmart has rotisserie ovens
02-04-2018T03:13:40,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what comes to mind for me
02-04-2018T03:13:55,Bigboi182,Nothing comes to mind for me...
02-04-2018T03:14:01,Bgrmystr2,yeh I've seen small ones at like Sonic for cooking hotdogs
02-04-2018T03:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Now I‚Äôm hungry
02-04-2018T03:14:36,Bigboi182,So no one's going to notice how i'm in the potato state?
02-04-2018T03:14:38,Bgrmystr2,"but I've also seen bigass industrial ones that can do anything a normal oven can, and you never need to take the food out ever"
02-04-2018T03:14:42,Bgrmystr2,till it's done
02-04-2018T03:15:01,Dadrobit,"Brb, gonna go make a steak methinks."
02-04-2018T03:15:04,Dadrobit,Got hungry
02-04-2018T03:15:11,Bgrmystr2,"nope, big"
02-04-2018T03:15:15,Bigboi182,I'm hungry too.
02-04-2018T03:15:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Imma do a snack run too
02-04-2018T03:15:19,Bgrmystr2,I'm not lol
02-04-2018T03:15:30,Bigboi182,But there's no food in the hotel
02-04-2018T03:15:37,Bigboi182,And i'm broke...
02-04-2018T03:15:46,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I guess having a technologically advanced oven = inferior cooking.. even though it can do so much more"
02-04-2018T03:15:57,Bgrmystr2,The more you know :V
02-04-2018T03:16:09,Bigboi182,"Meh, I don't really care 'bout that stuff..."
02-04-2018T03:16:14,Bgrmystr2,I don't either
02-04-2018T03:16:29,Bigboi182,So why debate?
02-04-2018T03:16:33,Bgrmystr2,cuz dadro does
02-04-2018T03:16:39,Bgrmystr2,and he's fun
02-04-2018T03:16:43,Bigboi182,Makes sense.
02-04-2018T03:16:44,Bgrmystr2,:)
02-04-2018T03:17:22,Bigboi182,I REALLY hope Tom wasn't seeing this...
02-04-2018T03:17:34,SpazztasticKiwi,He had too have
02-04-2018T03:17:37,Bgrmystr2,tom's busy in twokinds of ovens :P
02-04-2018T03:17:39,SpazztasticKiwi,*to
02-04-2018T03:18:22,Bigboi182,That's so true Bgr.
02-04-2018T03:18:27,Bgrmystr2,hehe
02-04-2018T03:18:38,Bigboi182,He should be asleep.
02-04-2018T03:18:55,Bgrmystr2,"he's likely either sleeping, or soon to be"
02-04-2018T03:18:55,SpazztasticKiwi,So should most of us
02-04-2018T03:18:57,Bigboi182,But schedules are pretty dead to him.
02-04-2018T03:18:58,Dadrobit,TIL: that medieval cooking practices = technologically advanced.
02-04-2018T03:19:00,Bgrmystr2,not me tho kiwi
02-04-2018T03:19:06,Bigboi182,Same with me.
02-04-2018T03:19:34,Bgrmystr2,lol dadro have you even seen one of those bigass rotating ovens? xD
02-04-2018T03:19:43,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
02-04-2018T03:19:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Told you he was here
02-04-2018T03:19:56,Bigboi182,What a surprise...
02-04-2018T03:20:03,Bgrmystr2,"see, tom's sleepin"
02-04-2018T03:20:17,Bigboi182,Emojis don't count Bgr...
02-04-2018T03:20:20,SpazztasticKiwi,So Holly‚Äôs typing?
02-04-2018T03:20:28,Bgrmystr2,do you not see the sleeping emoji?
02-04-2018T03:20:42,Dadrobit,"It's Rotisserie, literally been around since the dark ages, you're just not using a manual handle or flames."
02-04-2018T03:20:43,Bigboi182,That would be weird Kiwi...
02-04-2018T03:20:44,Bgrmystr2,what else would he say lol
02-04-2018T03:20:52,Bigboi182,Idk.
02-04-2018T03:21:08,Bigboi182,Tom: Sleep is for the WEAK!
02-04-2018T03:21:12,Dadrobit,At least if you were doing it over a flame you could argue that you're smoking it.
02-04-2018T03:21:16,Bigboi182,Maybe that.
02-04-2018T03:22:00,SpazztasticKiwi,üçø
02-04-2018T03:22:24,Dadrobit,:D
02-04-2018T03:22:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Tom doesnt smoke, silly"
02-04-2018T03:22:59,Bgrmystr2,"guess since it's so old, noone uses that cooking technique anymore or create massive machines that cook like that"
02-04-2018T03:23:06,Bgrmystr2,cuz there's much better ways
02-04-2018T03:23:08,Bgrmystr2,:v
02-04-2018T03:23:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Like takeout
02-04-2018T03:23:42,Bgrmystr2,"yes, nothing beats pulling up to a fast food and them magically conjuring food into existance from nothingness."
02-04-2018T03:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt you know that‚Äôs why so many people get mad about wait times?
02-04-2018T03:24:15,Bigboi182,Wendy's is STILL heaven to me.
02-04-2018T03:24:28,SpazztasticKiwi,We don‚Äôt have a Wendy‚Äôs
02-04-2018T03:24:29,Dadrobit,Of course they do. It's easy enough to use that Sonic employees can use them. And the industrial sized ones ensure easy production of food for all the people without any standards.
02-04-2018T03:24:34,Bigboi182,and KFC is actually good here.
02-04-2018T03:24:43,SpazztasticKiwi,No KFC either
02-04-2018T03:24:52,Bigboi182,"You're missing out, Kiwi."
02-04-2018T03:25:09,Bgrmystr2,"Dunno if I agree with that, Big"
02-04-2018T03:25:17,Bgrmystr2,I've had both and don't think I'd miss either one.
02-04-2018T03:25:29,Bgrmystr2,Wendy's frosty was good stuff tho
02-04-2018T03:26:10,Bigboi182,Pure good stuff.
02-04-2018T03:26:11,Bgrmystr2,It's the only soquid you eat with a fpoon.
02-04-2018T03:26:35,Bgrmystr2,wondering who would get that reference :thinking:
02-04-2018T03:26:47,Bigboi182,I do.
02-04-2018T03:27:01,Bigboi182,I grew up on the OG frostys.
02-04-2018T03:27:50,Bgrmystr2,they were the best &lt;3
02-04-2018T03:28:05,Bgrmystr2,haven't had a Frosty in a while
02-04-2018T03:28:06,Bigboi182,Of course.
02-04-2018T03:28:11,Bigboi182,Same here.
02-04-2018T03:28:11,Bgrmystr2,there are no Wendy's around here
02-04-2018T03:28:19,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt there a mcdonalds in america every 2 blocks or somethign
02-04-2018T03:28:21,Bgrmystr2,so last time was... pre-2002 I guess
02-04-2018T03:28:25,unsteddyphoenix,I heard that statistic somewhere
02-04-2018T03:28:30,unsteddyphoenix,And believe it to be accurate
02-04-2018T03:28:34,Bgrmystr2,McDonalds doesn't serve Wendy's Frosty
02-04-2018T03:28:44,Bgrmystr2,"and that's not exactly true, but there are a lot of Mcdonalds."
02-04-2018T03:28:55,Bgrmystr2,"like, a fucking LOT"
02-04-2018T03:29:34,Bigboi182,Thy
02-04-2018T03:29:45,Bigboi182,They're everywhere.
02-04-2018T03:30:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm really gonna go to bed soon now
02-04-2018T03:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I really need to
02-04-2018T03:30:29,Bigboi182,"If you came to where I live, you would hate McDonald's with a burning passion."
02-04-2018T03:30:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Night
02-04-2018T03:30:34,Bigboi182,Me too.
02-04-2018T03:30:42,Bgrmystr2,"Just looked on google maps, there's 19 mcdonalds in the New Orleans area. Like.. the entire metropolitan area"
02-04-2018T03:30:56,Bigboi182,It's gonna be a LONG day tomorrow.
02-04-2018T03:31:06,Bigboi182,Night Kiwi.
02-04-2018T03:31:09,Bgrmystr2,all sub-cities included
02-04-2018T03:31:17,Bigboi182,Jeez.
02-04-2018T03:31:25,Bgrmystr2,doesn't seem like a lot though
02-04-2018T03:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt forget to rotate in your sleep Tom. Don‚Äôt wanna burn
02-04-2018T03:31:32,Bgrmystr2,there's prolly more in denser cities
02-04-2018T03:31:38,Bigboi182,Mcdonald's sucks where i live.
02-04-2018T03:31:55,Bigboi182,All the food is pretty soggy.
02-04-2018T03:32:06,Bigboi182,And the fries are cold.
02-04-2018T03:32:08,Bgrmystr2,yeah they're not known to higher quality employees or use remotely decent food to cook
02-04-2018T03:32:15,Bgrmystr2,hire* wow
02-04-2018T03:32:18,Bgrmystr2,higher xD
02-04-2018T03:32:27,Bgrmystr2,my brain tonight
02-04-2018T03:32:35,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades:
02-04-2018T03:32:40,Bigboi182,Really? That explains a lot.
02-04-2018T03:32:50,Bigboi182,Sounds like you need some sleep.
02-04-2018T03:32:53,Bgrmystr2,It's mcdonalds. It's kind of obvious
02-04-2018T03:33:02,Bgrmystr2,I don't really sleep till like 5 or 6am tho
02-04-2018T03:33:09,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
02-04-2018T03:33:34,Bigboi182,"If your brain is screwing up now, it may be time to call it quits."
02-04-2018T03:33:46,Bgrmystr2,eh
02-04-2018T03:33:52,Bgrmystr2,this is only the beginning
02-04-2018T03:34:03,Bgrmystr2,"this is where the most fun begins, don't you know?"
02-04-2018T03:34:08,Bigboi182,If you say so...
02-04-2018T03:34:32,Bgrmystr2,you never see those streamers playing games while tired and failing miserably
02-04-2018T03:34:38,Bgrmystr2,and everything seems funny to them
02-04-2018T03:34:57,Bgrmystr2,even the funner-than-it-should-be stuff
02-04-2018T03:35:00,Bigboi182,"Yeah, those guys are insomniacs."
02-04-2018T03:35:07,Bgrmystr2,yeah see!
02-04-2018T03:35:09,Bgrmystr2,:D
02-04-2018T03:35:11,Bgrmystr2,I'm not tho
02-04-2018T03:35:22,Bgrmystr2,"When I lay down when I'm tired, I'm basically out"
02-04-2018T03:35:24,Bigboi182,That's a MUCH different story.
02-04-2018T03:35:28,Bgrmystr2,and down for the count till the morning
02-04-2018T03:35:42,Bigboi182,I'm in my bed now.
02-04-2018T03:35:57,Bgrmystr2,but it's the same thing tho Big. They're using their tiredness to create a form of entertainment for others.
02-04-2018T03:36:04,Bgrmystr2,insomnia or not
02-04-2018T03:36:04,Bigboi182,My comfy pull out hotel bed...
02-04-2018T03:36:15,Bigboi182,But who
02-04-2018T03:36:39,Bigboi182,But who is crazy enough to ride along with them?
02-04-2018T03:36:45,Bigboi182,Besides you.
02-04-2018T03:36:56,Bgrmystr2,I woul- WELL FINE :ptv-pouty:
02-04-2018T03:37:13,Bgrmystr2,"also, lots of ppl xD"
02-04-2018T03:37:26,Bigboi182,"Yeah, I saw that response coming..."
02-04-2018T03:37:27,Bgrmystr2,you know ppl record streams right
02-04-2018T03:37:31,Bigboi182,Yes.
02-04-2018T03:37:37,Bgrmystr2,and also not everyone lives in the same time zone
02-04-2018T03:37:39,Bgrmystr2,so..
02-04-2018T03:37:46,Bgrmystr2,people could have mornings or whatever xD
02-04-2018T03:37:53,Bgrmystr2,while these guys are super lacking sleep
02-04-2018T03:37:54,Bigboi182,But then there's those who host 24 hour livestreams.
02-04-2018T03:38:04,Bgrmystr2,no. they're fucking nutso xDD
02-04-2018T03:38:15,Bigboi182,Risking their lives for some 12 year olds...
02-04-2018T03:38:26,Bigboi182,Like... WHY?
02-04-2018T03:38:39,Bigboi182,That's crazy stuff.
02-04-2018T03:38:46,Bgrmystr2,"ppl who do 24 hr livestreams all the time are crazy, destroying their bodies for that kinda thing"
02-04-2018T03:38:51,Bgrmystr2,"every once in a while fine, but nuh"
02-04-2018T03:39:02,Bigboi182,Aaaand Tom's pulled out.
02-04-2018T03:39:06,Bgrmystr2,I know a streamer who streams like.. 30+ hrs in a row sometimes
02-04-2018T03:39:08,Bigboi182,FINALLY.
02-04-2018T03:39:16,Bigboi182,"Jesus, really?"
02-04-2018T03:39:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah
02-04-2018T03:39:36,Bigboi182,How is he not dead yet?
02-04-2018T03:39:42,Bgrmystr2,dunno
02-04-2018T03:39:52,Bgrmystr2,"the sheer power of cheeze, I guess"
02-04-2018T03:39:58,Bgrmystr2,though I guess you wouldn't understand that joke lol
02-04-2018T03:40:05,Bigboi182,He must have some crazy diet.
02-04-2018T03:40:16,Bgrmystr2,"naw, cheese is one of their characters"
02-04-2018T03:40:25,Bigboi182,Oh...
02-04-2018T03:40:30,Bgrmystr2,xD like I said

02-04-2018T03:42:07,Bigboi182,"Yeah, screw it, I'm out."
02-04-2018T03:42:15,Bgrmystr2,alright

02-04-2018T04:57:45,Dadrobit,"Cut it up into nice long strips, then gave 'em a nice sear."
02-04-2018T04:58:24,Dadrobit,Just a couple seconds on each edge so the center of each strip was still a healthy red.

02-04-2018T14:08:20,TheBeckoner,Pretty much
02-04-2018T14:12:12,Twokinds,I'm gunna take a shower and then probably start streaming in a little bit
02-04-2018T14:12:54,TheBeckoner,Gonna do some more sunday stream stuff?
02-04-2018T14:13:29,Twokinds,"No, Nora Cards"
02-04-2018T14:14:22,TheBeckoner,Also good
02-04-2018T14:15:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Yesterday it was cold and windy and today it‚Äôs warm and sunny. Weather needs to pick a season
02-04-2018T14:16:18,TheBeckoner,"Weather: ""Ok I can pick..."" *Picks all*"
02-04-2018T14:17:11,Twokinds,"Yeah two days ago there was snow, now it's 76F, with a tornado watch"
02-04-2018T14:20:16,TheBeckoner,I got sunny with a chance of hail
02-04-2018T14:20:30,TheBeckoner,and 80 degrees or so
02-04-2018T14:21:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Mother Nature and Father Time are having another argument
02-04-2018T14:21:31,Twokinds,"Tomorrow, they're predicting a high of 44F"
02-04-2018T14:21:40,Twokinds,And a low in the 30's
02-04-2018T14:22:55,TheBeckoner,Too many cold. 68-75 is pretty good to me. low humidity of course
02-04-2018T14:25:08,Twokinds,I wish I could find a way to keep my windows open without letting bugs in. My screens do nothing.
02-04-2018T14:25:22,Twokinds,"Luckily right now the bugs aren't out yet, but they will. They will."
02-04-2018T14:27:46,Dadrobit,":/ Heading to class, gonna miss the beginning of the stream today methinks."
02-04-2018T14:29:15,TheBeckoner,I would guess the bugs arent about when its cold out? Never really paid attention here.
02-04-2018T14:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,What screen still lets bugs in? That‚Äôs essentially their only purpose
02-04-2018T14:30:45,BadFoMo,There's going to be a stream soon?
02-04-2018T14:30:46,Twokinds,They can't seem to stop the tiny tiny gnats
02-04-2018T14:30:58,Twokinds,And we get swarmed by them.
02-04-2018T14:31:12,Twokinds,I don't know how to stop them.
02-04-2018T14:31:17,BadFoMo,I hate gnats.
02-04-2018T14:31:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Gnats don‚Äôt like vinegar
02-04-2018T14:31:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least they are so attaracted to it that die in it
02-04-2018T14:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Most bugs avoid mint and catnip, though if you want a preventative instead of a death trap"
02-04-2018T14:32:17,BadFoMo,Electric fly swaters work. I think.
02-04-2018T14:32:32,zolstarym,A very fine screen like cheese cloth might work. Put it over the current screens
02-04-2018T14:33:20,zolstarym,Used cheese cloth for swamp coolers because those would suck mosquitos in
02-04-2018T14:34:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Overwhelmed with help yet?
02-04-2018T14:43:36,TorqueEmUp,tiny flying insects are annoying AF
02-04-2018T14:44:54,TorqueEmUp,"fruitflies aren't too bad, but there are these ones that are like fruitflies, but are like so fast you have no hope of ever smashing them, and they like to fly up your nose and ear and all that fun stuff."
02-04-2018T14:46:19,TorqueEmUp,Also YAY! Tornado watch!
02-04-2018T14:46:26,TorqueEmUp,Love me some bad storms.
02-04-2018T15:12:11,TorqueEmUp,Tornado warning issued in the next county over from me
02-04-2018T15:12:41,TorqueEmUp,Air Force Base is already sounding the alarms for people out on the flight lines.
02-04-2018T15:36:07,Bgrmystr2,D:
02-04-2018T15:36:10,Bgrmystr2,Mornin
02-04-2018T15:36:16,Bgrmystr2,"also, be careful mate"
02-04-2018T15:39:02,TorqueEmUp,"yup, warning expired though"
02-04-2018T15:44:23,TorqueEmUp,Nope they reissued the warning
02-04-2018T15:44:34,TorqueEmUp,now for my area
02-04-2018T15:45:17,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad:
02-04-2018T15:46:36,TorqueEmUp,"but the radar is showing it just to the south east, so out of the path of the bow where the radar indicated the tornado"
02-04-2018T15:52:15,Twokinds,Rumble Rumble
02-04-2018T15:52:23,Twokinds,I hear the storms a-comin
02-04-2018T15:54:54,TorqueEmUp,yeah all the real bad stuff is a couple counties north of ya :P
02-04-2018T15:56:51,Twokinds,"Good, I prefer it that way."
02-04-2018T15:57:01,CrimsonHelsing,"Well, fingers crossed (AND NOT BEHIND MY BACK) that it's just rain"
02-04-2018T16:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,This guy down my road recently had his mailbox knocked over a while back
02-04-2018T16:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,He responded by buying another one and then surrounding it in its own little brick house
02-04-2018T16:10:37,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-04-2018T16:10:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Appropriate response
02-04-2018T16:11:05,SpazztasticKiwi,And it makes me laugh every time I go by it
02-04-2018T16:15:47,TorqueEmUp,Does it specifically have to be north of ya? lol
02-04-2018T16:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Thumper needs to tell his cousins to stop jumping in front of my car
02-04-2018T16:35:57,TheBeckoner,lol did yah hit a bunny?
02-04-2018T16:36:08,SpazztasticKiwi,No but it came close
02-04-2018T16:39:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, my friend bought a horse"
02-04-2018T16:39:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Because she could
02-04-2018T16:39:44,WIPKING,So today in history you were learning about shell shock in World War 1 My teacher asked what what is shellshock also known for and a girl answered STD and the class was laughing for 30 minutes without getting any work done
02-04-2018T16:40:03,TheBeckoner,Gotta have a spare horse
02-04-2018T16:41:42,WIPKING,Then my writing teacher said a sentence about a woman needing action and then she said that sounds bad and then we realize that she made a bad joke
02-04-2018T16:42:56,WIPKING,My school is effed-up
02-04-2018T16:53:20,WIPKING,Im going to try and draw someone in twokinds raging on xbox but i dont know who to do any ideas?
02-04-2018T16:58:07,WIPKING,Like i dont see any of the characters raging on xbox
02-04-2018T17:44:03,Combak,"So, who else is hanging around?"
02-04-2018T17:47:35,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-tease:
02-04-2018T17:48:34,BadFoMo,"Me, I guess?"
02-04-2018T17:54:38,Combak,Hey guys.
02-04-2018T17:54:52,Bgrmystr2,hey
02-04-2018T17:54:59,BluePhantom90,hey
02-04-2018T17:56:28,WIPKING,Wow
02-04-2018T17:59:17,BadFoMo,Yo.
02-04-2018T18:13:54,CheeseRS,Hey all
02-04-2018T18:14:00,CheeseRS,Why are we here?
02-04-2018T18:14:28,Bgrmystr2,Some of us live here
02-04-2018T18:14:49,CheeseRS,That's nice and sad at the same time
02-04-2018T18:15:21,Bgrmystr2,"also, there might be a stream today which tends to help keep the conversation going."
02-04-2018T18:15:24,CheeseRS,"Who will stream sooner? Sage, Tom?"
02-04-2018T18:16:00,Bgrmystr2,"Tom, most likely, considering he said there'd probably be one today after he takes a shower"
02-04-2018T18:16:06,Bgrmystr2,but sage likely won't be streaming until Friday
02-04-2018T18:16:10,Bgrmystr2,at the usual time.
02-04-2018T18:17:01,CheeseRS,Yeah I still don't remember the schedule of these two...
02-04-2018T18:17:11,Bgrmystr2,"it's at the top of the chat, for tom"
02-04-2018T18:17:17,Bgrmystr2,and sage has it on his stream offline page
02-04-2018T18:17:23,Bgrmystr2,so it's not like it's unavailable.
02-04-2018T18:18:09,CheeseRS,"Well besides having a barely enough big screen (5"") I am also too lazy to notice all of this stuff."
02-04-2018T18:18:50,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a personal problem. :thinking:
02-04-2018T18:19:01,CheeseRS,Why does Tom have to stream so late anyway? It's 2:18 AM here...
02-04-2018T18:19:09,CheeseRS,I have many personal problems
02-04-2018T18:19:19,Bgrmystr2,He doesn't.
02-04-2018T18:19:25,Bgrmystr2,It's 7pm there.
02-04-2018T18:19:41,CheeseRS,Are you near his time zone?
02-04-2018T18:19:53,CheeseRS,Are you his neighbor?
02-04-2018T18:19:58,Bgrmystr2,"He streams based on his time zone, which is Eastern Time."
02-04-2018T18:20:05,Bgrmystr2,"And I'm Central time, one hour behind."
02-04-2018T18:20:48,CheeseRS,So he starts streaming at... 9 pm?
02-04-2018T18:20:56,Bgrmystr2,"It's not tom who is streaming late, it's just that you happen to live in a timezone that doesn't suit well to when tom does stream."
02-04-2018T18:21:04,CheeseRS,Exactly.
02-04-2018T18:21:14,Bgrmystr2,"he streams at 9pm on Friday, and 4pm on Sunday"
02-04-2018T18:21:19,Bgrmystr2,Neither of which are late.
02-04-2018T18:22:00,CheeseRS,9pm be 3 am for me... And 4pm is 10pm for me? Agh I hate time zone difference
02-04-2018T18:22:26,CheeseRS,"Yeah, I'm right with this."
02-04-2018T18:23:09,CheeseRS,"So the only stream I can watch relaxed is the Sunday one... But not now, the whole week is a free week."
02-04-2018T18:23:15,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: not everyone can catch the stream on Fri because it goes into the night. So it's not like you're the only one.
02-04-2018T18:23:42,CheeseRS,You're not wrong.
02-04-2018T18:23:58,Bgrmystr2,"It doesn't matter what time Tom picks to stream, someone who watches it will end up being inconvenienced by the time zone difference."
02-04-2018T18:24:06,Bgrmystr2,There will always be someone.
02-04-2018T18:24:58,Bgrmystr2,"Thankfully, the streams are recorded by Picarto"
02-04-2018T18:25:05,CheeseRS,"I know, people from Asia are the most affected since the stream is live at... 4-5-6 in the morning?"
02-04-2018T18:25:17,CheeseRS,I know... But I love to be part of the chat
02-04-2018T18:25:45,Bgrmystr2,"indeed, that seems like the consensus"
02-04-2018T18:26:10,Bgrmystr2,but there's several people in eastern / western europe.. even in Russia
02-04-2018T18:26:17,CheeseRS,Like me
02-04-2018T18:26:21,Bgrmystr2,a few in other parts of Asia
02-04-2018T18:26:40,CheeseRS,That can watch the stream?
02-04-2018T18:27:31,Bgrmystr2,They're all like you. The streams start at wonky hours of the night or morning due to time differences.
02-04-2018T18:27:52,Bgrmystr2,it happens.
02-04-2018T18:27:53,CheeseRS,And that's why I hate the rotation of the earth...
02-04-2018T18:28:06,Bgrmystr2,"well, if it didn't rotate, we'd all be dead anyway so"
02-04-2018T18:28:08,Bgrmystr2,:v
02-04-2018T18:28:41,CheeseRS,"Nah, but some part of the world would be deep fried in sun and others would bathe in an endless night"
02-04-2018T18:29:45,Bgrmystr2,"one side too cold, other side too hot, and basically a severe and profound weather system that would make sustainable life difficult anywhere else"
02-04-2018T18:29:50,CheeseRS,I'd like to see Texas people sunbathing 24/7
02-04-2018T18:30:16,CheeseRS,1 hour until the said stream?
02-04-2018T18:30:32,Bgrmystr2,"Tom didn't give a time, he just said ""probably"""
02-04-2018T18:30:41,Bgrmystr2,so nothing is confirmed
02-04-2018T18:30:51,Bgrmystr2,we just wait and see
02-04-2018T18:31:06,CheeseRS,Hmm... I don't trust this Tom guy... I think Thomas is a better person than him
02-04-2018T18:31:29,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: Because they're totally different people lol
02-04-2018T18:31:36,CheeseRS,Yeah...
02-04-2018T18:31:55,CheeseRS,"Anyway, I'll let my phone CHARGE until the stream"
02-04-2018T18:32:09,CheeseRS,IF there's one today
02-04-2018T18:34:20,CheeseRS,Quick/rhetorical question: If Picarto is so NSFW friendly... Could I not get banned by streaming myself pee?
02-04-2018T18:35:09,Bgrmystr2,"no, that's not the same"
02-04-2018T18:36:03,CheeseRS,I could have gotten so many donations that way...

02-04-2018T18:38:32,Bgrmystr2,the sarcasm is not lost on you
02-04-2018T18:38:45,CheeseRS,Oh but you never know...
02-04-2018T18:39:01,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. you're right. :thinking:
02-04-2018T18:39:06,Bgrmystr2,but still.
02-04-2018T18:39:19,CheeseRS,"Agh emojis, I get cancer easily from them"
02-04-2018T18:39:25,Bgrmystr2,I'll remain positive until proven wrong.
02-04-2018T18:39:43,CheeseRS,You seem pretty confident.
02-04-2018T18:39:43,Bgrmystr2,which seems to happen a lot.
02-04-2018T18:39:54,Bgrmystr2,Am I not supposed to be confident?
02-04-2018T18:40:00,CheeseRS,What? Being proven wrong?
02-04-2018T18:40:02,Bgrmystr2,is that not allowed in the furry community?
02-04-2018T18:40:18,CheeseRS,It's actually encouraged
02-04-2018T18:40:36,Bgrmystr2,"being proven wrong about remaining positive, yes. I think things can go well, and then shit goes wonky all the time."
02-04-2018T18:40:44,Bgrmystr2,Happens.
02-04-2018T18:41:04,CheeseRS,"But since we all can relate to r/furry_irl, so those who are not... They are the problem"
02-04-2018T18:41:11,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, with all the crippling dipression and other meme stuff goin on, not sure if confidence is actually a thing that exists."
02-04-2018T18:41:23,CheeseRS,It's just a prank bro
02-04-2018T18:41:37,Bgrmystr2,yeh okay xD

02-04-2018T20:26:18,Vatruvius,SoT is not about your character Mystic...it is about the adventure of being a pirate and looking for treasure. Especially with friends...the only thing that really changes gear wise would be more epic clothing befitting a captain or something.
02-04-2018T20:26:19,qwe304,"@CheeseRS never heard that term, have heard of a more rude one with the same definition though"

02-04-2018T21:26:21,CheeseRS,Right now somebody posted a meme on the game's server

02-04-2018T21:29:58,WIPKING,Wait i have his arta nd evolution book maybe its there
02-04-2018T21:30:01,Zakuru,its more of my first pixel animation to be honest

02-04-2018T21:30:06,CheeseRS,Its just magic
02-04-2018T21:30:37,Bgrmystr2,Vatru don't try. Most ppl won't always get a 2d to 3d space transition
02-04-2018T21:30:49,Bgrmystr2,"and realistically, it doesn't always work anyway"
02-04-2018T21:30:54,Vatruvius,I am not...don't worry.

02-04-2018T21:36:33,Bgrmystr2,and then he'll work on it more.
02-04-2018T21:36:39,ZRO4825,Thoughts on the movie itself aside (as I haven't seen it yet) what I've seen of the animations from it were beautiful
02-04-2018T21:36:40,Bgrmystr2,and then work on it more after that.
02-04-2018T21:36:45,Alphawolf333,but he already said done

02-04-2018T21:46:31,ZRO4825,COD games ARE a wasete of money. :P

02-04-2018T21:53:33,Vatruvius,Natani is good at catching Keiths
02-04-2018T21:53:39,JDH,lol
02-04-2018T21:53:50,Dadrobit,makes sense.
02-04-2018T21:53:58,Dadrobit,Better than Alaric at least.
02-04-2018T21:54:02,CrimsonHelsing,So - much - detail - I can't take it! Mah brayne!! Mah- *boom*
02-04-2018T21:54:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,too soon dad

02-04-2018T21:54:37,JDH,this looks like it would be a great print!
02-04-2018T21:54:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, tbh I almost feel bad about that one."
02-04-2018T21:54:53,unsteddyphoenix,:(
02-04-2018T21:54:59,Vatruvius,It is kinda like the Steps Waterfall in Yosemite.

02-04-2018T21:55:46,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, dadro, he DID catch Alaric."
02-04-2018T21:55:49,WIPKING,Put a chicken on the fire
02-04-2018T21:55:53,Dadrobit,Not very well.
02-04-2018T21:56:02,Bgrmystr2,not true
02-04-2018T21:56:19,Dadrobit,And all I said was that Natani was better.
02-04-2018T21:56:27,Bgrmystr2,upfront catching something and keeping your grip on that something are two very different things.
02-04-2018T21:56:36,Dadrobit,"Of the two, which one still has a Keith?"
02-04-2018T21:56:42,WIPKING,"Natani is 6, 3 and keith is 5,5 like me"
02-04-2018T21:57:00,Vatruvius,Also...I believe Keith did not lose his grip but rather Alaric's shirt sleave ripped.
02-04-2018T21:57:07,TheBeckoner,Nice lil fire
02-04-2018T21:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Happy fire

02-04-2018T21:57:40,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, yeah, Alaric caught is palm and his sleeve."
02-04-2018T21:58:43,WIPKING,Does keith have a middle name?
02-04-2018T21:58:51,ProsePro7,This looks like a honeymoon scene
02-04-2018T21:58:51,JDH,holy detail Tom! love it!
02-04-2018T21:58:56,WIPKING,Again ?s that have no answers
02-04-2018T21:59:01,Dadrobit,Whereas Natani has been shown to catch Keith in a much more full fashion. http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/809/
02-04-2018T21:59:12,Vatruvius,I cannot think of a single middle name to any character in this comic.
02-04-2018T21:59:26,WIPKING,Dad that is my fav. Comic
02-04-2018T21:59:28,Bgrmystr2,Yes dadro let's compare things that have no connections. xD

02-04-2018T22:00:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yes, him and nat are Irish"
02-04-2018T22:00:39,Dadrobit,"Knocking him over is irrelevent, she's still gottem."
02-04-2018T22:01:04,unsteddyphoenix,Touche
02-04-2018T22:01:07,Vatruvius,"Okay...but ""cuteboi"" is a middle name I have never heard of before. Are you sure your personal opinion is not showing through?"
02-04-2018T22:01:28,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru, it's marv"

02-04-2018T22:04:02,Bgrmystr2,Every moment you spend thinking about it.. that's another moment you're not acting.
02-04-2018T22:04:13,Vatruvius,You never think with portals...portals think for you!
02-04-2018T22:04:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gotta have quick feet in this chat
02-04-2018T22:04:20,WIPKING,So glad this was a earlyer stream somi can go to bed on time.
02-04-2018T22:04:55,Vatruvius,You can always leave the stream early and watch the recording the following day.
02-04-2018T22:05:03,Bgrmystr2,indeed
02-04-2018T22:05:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,but that boring

02-04-2018T22:05:53,Bgrmystr2,for this particular instance..  gonna agree w/ Vatru
02-04-2018T22:05:59,TomFurson,I am debating in my head to get a Huion GT-221 Pro or waiting and getting a Wacom Cintiq 27QHD or Wacom Cintiq Pro 24. Does anyone have any input?
02-04-2018T22:06:07,Vatruvius,I am not going to lose my job or get failing grades to catch a stream.
02-04-2018T22:06:09,Bgrmystr2,"if you were smart, you wouldn't be saying that WIP xD"
02-04-2018T22:06:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Huion GT-221

02-04-2018T22:06:31,WIPKING,Ever*
02-04-2018T22:06:31,JDH,"Tom, have you ever thought about doing a short video tutorial on how you do certain things? Such as say, legs, feet, hands or something like that? I know you did the still of legs but have you thought of doing a video lesson?"
02-04-2018T22:06:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Been loking at that one for a while
02-04-2018T22:06:43,JDH,could make for patreon only or something?
02-04-2018T22:06:56,ZRO4825,I've seen various comments about people having issues with Huion stuff. Drivers not wanting to install properly and such.
02-04-2018T22:07:02,Bgrmystr2,"Tom's got the Wacom 27QHD, @TomFurson"
02-04-2018T22:07:04,Vatruvius,That would be interesting JDH.
02-04-2018T22:07:37,Bgrmystr2,The issues he has with it may not be relevant if you grabbed it.
02-04-2018T22:07:39,Vatruvius,I thought Tom is using the 24HD and thinking about a 27QHD?
02-04-2018T22:07:40,TomFurson,The thing is if I wait and do a lot of work during the summer I could get a Wacom. Or I could get a Huion before the summer
02-04-2018T22:07:45,Bgrmystr2,no Vatru
02-04-2018T22:07:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'm saying Huion, because both Tom and OneyNG both have had issues with wacoms stuff"
02-04-2018T22:07:58,Bgrmystr2,"he switched forever ago, the 24HD died"
02-04-2018T22:08:14,TomFurson,What kind of problems?
02-04-2018T22:08:28,Vatruvius,Okay...so he needs to update what tool he is using in the description then?
02-04-2018T22:08:37,Bgrmystr2,"Welcome to the club, Vatru"
02-04-2018T22:08:41,Bgrmystr2,we've been saying that for months xD
02-04-2018T22:08:51,Dadrobit,"JDH, supposedly more comprehensive tutorials are something that are on the horizon, however I dunno about video tutorials."
02-04-2018T22:08:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Oney was complaining about, drivers, the digitizer, and the OS on the companion"
02-04-2018T22:09:20,TomFurson,Wait so Tom is not using a wacom or is he still?
02-04-2018T22:09:29,Dadrobit,He is using a wacom
02-04-2018T22:09:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"no he's using a wacom uhd 27"""
02-04-2018T22:09:38,Bgrmystr2,Yeah like I said he's still using the Wacom 27QHD
02-04-2018T22:09:44,Vatruvius,Alright...I got to take out the trash and put away some dishes. I do not want any interesting subjects discussed while I am gone...you hear me!?!
02-04-2018T22:09:45,WIPKING,Hey @iliar you should do 50 times speed for this one
02-04-2018T22:09:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,from what he said he's not a fan
02-04-2018T22:10:01,Bgrmystr2,He liked the older one though
02-04-2018T22:10:01,TomFurson,I see...
02-04-2018T22:10:05,Bgrmystr2,the 24HD
02-04-2018T22:10:08,CrimsonHelsing,"Ah dang, I want to link a friend to this channel but there's no share button on mobile lol!"
02-04-2018T22:10:10,JDH,"dadrobit: ah, well i think it would be intresting for a video, idk just my thoughts"
02-04-2018T22:10:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah, if you can snag a 24hd wacom, go for that"
02-04-2018T22:10:27,Bgrmystr2,crimson you could literally just type it...
02-04-2018T22:10:33,Bgrmystr2,._.
02-04-2018T22:10:39,Vatruvius,Maybe a live stream turned recording JDH?
02-04-2018T22:10:47,Vatruvius,Be back later guys.
02-04-2018T22:10:49,Dadrobit,"type it out yo, not a terribly long url."
02-04-2018T22:11:03,TomFurson,the 24 is slightly cheaper than the 27 so might as well wait for the 27
02-04-2018T22:11:16,WIPKING,You hold the url then it syas copy then paste it
02-04-2018T22:11:23,WIPKING,Says*
02-04-2018T22:11:47,Dadrobit,"JDH, only problem would be instruction. Tom's not the most vocal of people, and text can be very hit/miss for explaining what's going on."
02-04-2018T22:11:50,TomFurson,If I can ever get a hold of Tom I will ask for his pros and cons for wacom
02-04-2018T22:12:31,Bgrmystr2,"He's already talked about it a few times. Mostly that the resolution is super nice, but it doesn't do everything he wants it to"
02-04-2018T22:12:44,Twokinds,Done
02-04-2018T22:12:48,TomFurson,Looks good

02-04-2018T22:14:03,Dadrobit,"Not gonna link though, age-restricted."
02-04-2018T22:14:12,Dadrobit,I am SO glad you got that
02-04-2018T22:14:21,BadFoMo,Why do the backgrounds always look so good?

02-04-2018T22:14:48,Alphawolf333,and most of the time went into making it
02-04-2018T22:14:56,Alphawolf333,or maybe it was the tent
02-04-2018T22:14:59,CrimsonHelsing,"I actually enjoyed watching this, and I love the end results O.o"

02-04-2018T22:57:00,Vatruvius,comes in with the Imperial Boop Army Corp. from 3074 BCE.
02-04-2018T22:57:00,DarthRexKing,The reason why I was asking where Leilani lived is because I was hoping to make a tanning beach joke with the nuclear bombs that were tested at the bikini atoll IF Leilani lived close there. XD
02-04-2018T22:57:03,Leilani,"actually, i'm waiting for thunder to stop rolling so I can sleep, thats why i'm here and not in bed yet. ^^"
02-04-2018T22:57:11,Bigboi182,We all have issues.
02-04-2018T22:57:16,TheBeckoner,My name is more of a title I guess
02-04-2018T22:57:20,DarthRexKing,Pfft. It's just lightening.
02-04-2018T22:57:32,Leilani,"Darth: She grows up in Bora Bora, if you read the comic ^^"
02-04-2018T22:57:34,Sunfish43,"Thanks for having me, but I gotta go to bed. Continue to enjoy the stream everyone!"
02-04-2018T22:57:51,SageSaga,"the song has this line - ""I just bite my tongue and when I want to say I love you I say, Boop."""

02-04-2018T22:58:11,Vatruvius,I actually love lighting ans storms...find their power exciting.
02-04-2018T22:58:11,Leilani,"And I lost the damned Discord links in all the chat. Re-whisper, qwe304"
02-04-2018T22:58:14,SageSaga,so if the boop master doesnt get boops- the boop master is without love
02-04-2018T22:58:17,DarthRexKing,Alright.

02-04-2018T22:59:03,DarthRexKing,"So keep up with what people are saying, because no one will repeat things for you."
02-04-2018T22:59:03,Bgrmystr2,The best boops are made with a pink heart grenade launcher twohanded hammer.

02-04-2018T23:01:52,Bgrmystr2,"chat is so slow, even on ""fast"" days"
02-04-2018T23:02:07,DarthRexKing,This chat is faster than other ones I have been on.
02-04-2018T23:02:16,DarthRexKing,"That is a good thing, conversation!"
02-04-2018T23:02:34,Bgrmystr2,Anything slower than this chat I'd consider on the edge of dead.
02-04-2018T23:02:56,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"that's because you're a hummingbird, Bgr"
02-04-2018T23:03:05,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: Am I?!
02-04-2018T23:03:12,Bgrmystr2,I did not know this
02-04-2018T23:03:15,ItsActuallyKopyKat,anything not drinking sugar water and flying at speed is considered dead to you
02-04-2018T23:03:25,DarthRexKing,I do not believe people chatting less means they are dead. What kind of logic is that?
02-04-2018T23:03:31,Bgrmystr2,"""at speed"""

02-04-2018T23:05:02,DarthRexKing,Well do not take it out on me because you cannot sleep through a little lightening.
02-04-2018T23:05:02,Bgrmystr2,"that's cuz you're gone for several minutes at a time, zro lol"
02-04-2018T23:05:07,Bgrmystr2,of course it's a pain xD

02-04-2018T23:56:38,Bgrmystr2,if this story is actually in the same world of twokinds
02-04-2018T23:56:40,Bgrmystr2,that'd be badass
02-04-2018T23:56:45,TheBeckoner,I wonder if human tech could catch up to Noras level of power
02-04-2018T23:56:48,Twokinds,There's technology but no microprocessors it's all magic based.
02-04-2018T23:56:49,unsteddyphoenix,It must be

02-04-2018T23:57:23,BadFoMo,I always saw Nora (in the future) as trying to blend in as a Huna.
02-04-2018T23:57:24,Alphawolf333,magicpunk? is that a thing?

02-04-2018T23:57:45,Vatruvius,"I feel like we need to, at the beginning of every stream, create a little blurb about what is going on and just copy paste it when people ask Bgr."
02-04-2018T23:57:45,DeanFox,this is a cute picture twokinds

02-04-2018T23:58:25,Twokinds,"They have teleportation, which has caused cities to spread out a lot more."
02-04-2018T23:58:29,Twokinds,But no computers.
02-04-2018T23:58:38,TheBeckoner,so still no mass communication?
02-04-2018T23:58:48,unsteddyphoenix,Teleport notes to each other
02-04-2018T23:58:49,Vatruvius,Magic electricity? Light bulbs?
02-04-2018T23:58:50,Ordithus,That would sure make commuting easier
02-04-2018T23:58:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can still look at the menu, I‚Äôm just not gonna order"
02-04-2018T23:58:59,Alphawolf333,mass communication in the form of instant mail
02-04-2018T23:59:05,BadFoMo,"So, this is set in a world where it's our time, but they still have the magic from the past that we lost?"
02-04-2018T23:59:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,teleport mail
02-04-2018T23:59:12,unsteddyphoenix,"He's not a piece of meat, Kiwi. Pls respec"

02-04-2018T23:59:34,SpazztasticKiwi,He looks nice. That‚Äôs all
02-04-2018T23:59:44,Vatruvius,If I ever became a menu for anyone...I would have a very strongly worded conversation with them.
02-04-2018T23:59:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Aww mis matching feet
02-04-2018T23:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know his personality. And it looks like he‚Äôs taken anyway
