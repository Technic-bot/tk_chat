26-08-2018T00:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt mind me. Just rolling down the hill
26-08-2018T00:49:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I know this question is left field but anyone know when Girl Scout cookies start selling?
26-08-2018T00:50:32,Bgrmystr2,there's.. a certain time?
26-08-2018T00:51:32,Bgrmystr2,"I did not know. Back when I lived in GA pre-2002,  there was a couple years where they'd come by once or twice a month.. every month"
26-08-2018T00:51:49,Bgrmystr2,"constantly, for like maybe 2 years straight? Plus a bit?"
26-08-2018T00:51:52,Bgrmystr2,or minus a bit?
26-08-2018T00:51:54,Bgrmystr2,around that
26-08-2018T00:52:21,Bgrmystr2,"stopped coming after a while, so they must have been fundraising for something, tis usually what they seem to do that for"
26-08-2018T00:53:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I was a Girl Scout, there was a time it started. This the reason to sell sell sell to gain prizes"
26-08-2018T00:54:21,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs been years and they‚Äôve changed a few things here n there
26-08-2018T00:54:34,TheBeckoner,You can usually buy them around spring iirc
26-08-2018T00:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm wanting some caramel delights
26-08-2018T00:56:16,TheBeckoner,are those the ones with the coconut?
26-08-2018T00:56:18,Bgrmystr2,you know you can buy those elsewhere right
26-08-2018T00:56:35,Bgrmystr2,girl scouts don't sell anything you can't buy at the store somewhere
26-08-2018T00:56:45,Bgrmystr2,and the price is always marked up
26-08-2018T00:57:00,Bgrmystr2,cuz you don't gotta go all the way to the store to buy em
26-08-2018T00:57:47,Bgrmystr2,"but they are fairly good, the cookies they sell"
26-08-2018T00:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre mimic ice creams too
26-08-2018T00:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"And yes, the ones with the coconut"
26-08-2018T00:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve had the knock offs and they‚Äôre good but they disappear in minutes if you sit down with them
26-08-2018T00:59:33,TheBeckoner,Those are my favorite
26-08-2018T00:59:36,TheBeckoner,and yeah
26-08-2018T00:59:52,TheBeckoner,"they must have extra ""eat more of me"" chemicals"
26-08-2018T00:59:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Can y‚Äôall imagine Maeve as a Girl Scout selling cookies with Maddie
26-08-2018T01:00:21,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWould you like some-‚Äú

26-08-2018T01:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd believe it
26-08-2018T01:01:24,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHow many did you sell?‚Äù
26-08-2018T01:01:37,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúJust a few. But we made $400‚Äù
26-08-2018T01:02:49,Bgrmystr2,"""made"""
26-08-2018T01:02:55,TheBeckoner,"""And got this car"""
26-08-2018T01:02:55,Twokinds,gscookies are so expensive it wouldn't take that many
26-08-2018T01:02:58,Twokinds,it's such a racket
26-08-2018T01:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. ‚ÄúMade‚Äù Totally
26-08-2018T01:04:01,InTheLionsDen,The cookie manufacturers are still making full profit plus the added donation to the GS.
26-08-2018T01:04:05,Bgrmystr2,"maybe if she said ""gained"" she wouldn't be wrong."
26-08-2018T01:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs true. It used to be $3.00 but I joined when it went to $3.50
26-08-2018T01:05:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember one building we used to go to was an oil building. All the secretary ladies would buy some

26-08-2018T03:58:06,Bgrmystr2,"and the yellow one isn't saved by picarto anymore, so he probably replaced it"

26-08-2018T04:00:22,Bgrmystr2,changing 8 to 9 gives you the blue version lol
26-08-2018T04:00:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Not showing. But a yellow background would‚Äôve blended with the sparkles

26-08-2018T15:12:24,Bgrmystr2,please xD
26-08-2018T15:13:36,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah kiwi, but I sorta like the blend myself"
26-08-2018T15:14:21,Bgrmystr2,"but the blue attracts less attention which pushes it towards the stars instead, so that's good"
26-08-2018T15:44:37,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Peeping Squirrel https://www.patreon.com/posts/peeping-squirrel-21023116
26-08-2018T15:47:02,Bgrmystr2,..nibblybot?
26-08-2018T15:47:30,Bgrmystr2,"also, not that I can see it, cuz patreon is PRUDE &gt;:U"
26-08-2018T15:53:30,iliar,"Picarto does not support attaching files. I can recommend you go to the Discord. In the Discord, Nibs attaches the file to the notification"
26-08-2018T15:55:20,Bgrmystr2,bit is it the big one? Cuz it tends to change a lot
26-08-2018T15:56:23,iliar,Or you can use this https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Peeping-Nibbly-761411152
26-08-2018T15:58:00,Bgrmystr2,oh it was finally posted eh
26-08-2018T15:59:09,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah the one on deviantart is bigger, so I'm going to guess that the bot doesn't bother saving the big one from patreon, just whichever one it's coded to see"
26-08-2018T16:00:45,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno how you got to that link though, it's not on his front page, the recent sketch page, or anywhere else for that matter"
26-08-2018T16:01:56,kts,for some reason it's in the scraps section of Tom's deviantart
26-08-2018T16:02:12,kts,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/gallery/?catpath=scraps
26-08-2018T16:02:34,iliar,The bot saves the original version of the file in this folder https://yadi.sk/d/44j2dL6U3G9HGQ
26-08-2018T16:03:58,Bgrmystr2,then yeah it probably doesn't actually see the difference
26-08-2018T16:04:05,Bgrmystr2,cuz there's two uploads on patreon
26-08-2018T16:04:14,Bgrmystr2,a bigger and smaller version
26-08-2018T16:04:39,Bgrmystr2,and how you get them sometimes swaps. Sometimes the way you get the bigger one gets the smaller one instead for some images
26-08-2018T16:05:06,Bgrmystr2,"it's probably just how the site uploads them, but it's a thing that ppl seem to still not realize"
26-08-2018T16:05:28,Bgrmystr2,so the smaller one was probably uploaded to yandex
26-08-2018T16:06:44,iliar,I do not understand what two versions you are talking about.
26-08-2018T16:06:56,Bgrmystr2,didn't think so
26-08-2018T16:07:38,Bgrmystr2,"https://www.patreon.com/posts/dinner-date-20943461 This is a prime example. If you right click the image and ""view image"" it gives you a 1600x1000 version"

26-08-2018T16:08:24,Bgrmystr2,"if you click the image to make it larger, and THEN right click and view image, it loads a 1920x1200"

26-08-2018T16:08:54,Bgrmystr2,the links themselves are completely different
26-08-2018T16:09:44,Bgrmystr2,"and sometimes, the website swaps the image sizes."
26-08-2018T16:10:00,Bgrmystr2,"so instead of the 2nd one being 1920x1200, that one would be the 1600x1000"
26-08-2018T16:10:08,Bgrmystr2,and the first one would be the 1920x1200
26-08-2018T16:10:37,Bgrmystr2,"it's happened several times in the past, and I always make a point to check and make sure I have the larger one."
26-08-2018T16:10:59,iliar,"I know about it. In some cases, the patron resize image. But it software resize. More resolution but equal quality."
26-08-2018T16:12:38,iliar,The bot downloads the original file. Not resized image.
26-08-2018T16:14:25,Bgrmystr2,a smaller res equals a lower quality.
26-08-2018T16:14:40,iliar,Not always.
26-08-2018T16:15:00,Bgrmystr2,"you say that, but perhaps you just don't notice."
26-08-2018T16:15:35,Bgrmystr2,"dinner date one good example, the 1600 res version is of a lower quality, albeit slightly"
26-08-2018T16:16:20,Bgrmystr2,more pixels = more data = closer colors and lines.
26-08-2018T16:16:36,iliar,"For example, you can download a file. Use Photoshop change resolution. And get extremely huge file. But quality not changed."
26-08-2018T16:17:04,Bgrmystr2,"of course not, but that's not the same as saving the same image as a smaller resolution"
26-08-2018T16:17:18,TheDogKing,Thanks For The Folder iliar
26-08-2018T16:17:30,iliar,The software resize does not increase quality
26-08-2018T16:17:48,Bgrmystr2,"it does not increase quality, no. It /lowers/ quality for a smaller image."
26-08-2018T16:17:52,Bgrmystr2,which is what I am saying
26-08-2018T16:18:12,Bgrmystr2,"the original image is bigger, not smaller."
26-08-2018T16:19:13,iliar,I do not know what genius came up with the idea of generating thumbnail larger resolution than original.
26-08-2018T16:19:43,Bgrmystr2,I don't think that exists
26-08-2018T16:19:46,Bgrmystr2,at all
26-08-2018T16:20:18,Bgrmystr2,the only time you see garbage like that is thumbnails for youtube videos and other stuff that looks all pixelated
26-08-2018T16:21:09,iliar,In this case original image is smaller. But then Patreon generating thumbnail larger resolution then original.
26-08-2018T16:21:22,Bgrmystr2,that's absolutely not true.
26-08-2018T16:21:48,iliar,Prove
26-08-2018T16:22:35,Bgrmystr2,"I literally just goddamn did it by showing you the 1920x1200. It's you that is backwards. The original image is the bigger resolution, and the 1600x1000 is the thumbnail it's using."
26-08-2018T16:22:38,Bgrmystr2,xD
26-08-2018T16:23:09,Bgrmystr2,"You do not see websites making bigger resolution thumbnails than the original image at the same quality, that's preposterous"
26-08-2018T16:23:48,Bgrmystr2,"the only way they could do that is an upscale, and upscales look bad, plus they're extremely noticable."
26-08-2018T16:25:22,Bgrmystr2,"the only thing that doesn't look half bad is the vector upscaling like how waifu2x uses, and if you are really going to tell me that websites have the time to train an engine for hundreds to thousands of hours just to create a bigger thumbnail, I'd laugh"
26-08-2018T16:25:27,iliar,Okay. Fine.
26-08-2018T16:25:41,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's also noticable in what it does
26-08-2018T16:26:07,Bgrmystr2,"the technology to make an image ""Bigger"" with a similar quality does not exist, and websites like patreon will not have anything secret like that"
26-08-2018T16:28:10,Bgrmystr2,"you can ask tom what size he uploaded the dinner date image as, and I guarantee you it's gonna be 1920x1200"
26-08-2018T16:28:42,Bgrmystr2,and that it was patreon that simply lowered it to 1600x1000 for a thumbnail for the image
26-08-2018T16:29:00,Bgrmystr2,"cuz that's how sites work, they take the image, and make a smaller thumbnail, not a bigger one"
26-08-2018T16:29:35,Bgrmystr2,cuz smaller image = less data = save money on server costs
26-08-2018T16:30:04,iliar,So I work NORMAL sites.
26-08-2018T16:35:19,iliar,"That is, if the programmer makes a mistake and in some cases creates thumbnails of a larger resolution than the original, you will argue that it is the thumbnail that will be the source file."
26-08-2018T16:36:22,Bgrmystr2,"No I won't, cuz the thumbnail will be pixelated as hell because they'd have to tell the site to UPSCALE the image from the source to make a bigger thumbnail"
26-08-2018T16:37:22,Bgrmystr2,"Also, that's not even what a thumbnail is."
26-08-2018T16:37:54,Bgrmystr2,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbnail ""Thumbnails are reduced-size versions of pictures or videos, used to help in recognizing and organizing them, serving the same role for images as a normal text index does for words."""
26-08-2018T16:39:42,Bgrmystr2,I dunno how you keep coming to backwards conclusions that don't even make sense
26-08-2018T16:39:44,Bgrmystr2,Dx
26-08-2018T16:40:07,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's actually kind of impressive, not gonna lie"
26-08-2018T16:40:09,iliar,"Open Patreon API. Bot downloads file who named as ""post_file"", others files Patreon named as ""thumbnail""."
26-08-2018T16:40:49,Bgrmystr2,"just cuz patreon labels it as a thumbnail doesn't mean it IS a thumbnail, it just means their system is bugged."
26-08-2018T16:42:13,Bgrmystr2,labels are just words. Thumbnails on websites don't automagically come with the label thumbnail attached to it
26-08-2018T16:42:57,Bgrmystr2,"it's either a smaller image, and is a thumbnail, or it's a bigger one and they messed up."
26-08-2018T16:43:35,Bgrmystr2,"hell, label it ""King Cobra of Spain"" and it'd be just as equal of a label as ""thumbnail"" lol"
26-08-2018T16:45:06,iliar,"I just looked. ""Dinner Date Dragon"" bot download in resolution 1920x1080. And this file named as ""post_file"". So ""Dinner Date Dragon"" is bad example."
26-08-2018T16:45:45,Bgrmystr2,How is it a bad example if I was using it to show that there's two versions of the image uploaded?
26-08-2018T16:45:51,Bgrmystr2,which there is.
26-08-2018T16:45:54,Bgrmystr2,and it has.
26-08-2018T16:47:19,iliar,"This is a bad example, because in the case with ""Dinner Date Dragon"" thumbnail has smaller resolution than original. It's okay."
26-08-2018T16:47:47,CrimsonQuill,Hullo.
26-08-2018T16:47:57,CrimsonQuill,What's going on?
26-08-2018T16:48:37,iliar,"But, as I said, sometimes Patreon create thumbnail in higher resolution than original. It's mistake."
26-08-2018T16:49:09,Bgrmystr2,"I'm trying to explain to ilar that patreon sometimes accidentally swaps the thumbnail with the actual resolution image file, and he just doesn't understand that sometimes that can happen"
26-08-2018T16:49:25,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
26-08-2018T16:49:33,CrimsonQuill,The stars sre out.
26-08-2018T16:49:39,Bgrmystr2,"and no iliar, it's not a bad example cuz you even see that there's two images uploaded and thus proving it did exactly as I meant it to. xD"
26-08-2018T16:49:58,CrimsonQuill,One can go stargazing for a bit where I am.
26-08-2018T16:50:04,iliar,"And in that case, if you open a thumbnail, you see equal quality with original."
26-08-2018T16:50:19,CrimsonQuill,Do you two stargaze?
26-08-2018T16:50:25,iliar,RTFM!
26-08-2018T16:50:28,Bgrmystr2,I'm looking for one that's swapped.
26-08-2018T16:50:36,CrimsonQuill,What does RTFM mean?
26-08-2018T16:51:52,iliar,Patreon have more than two version of image. One is original + few thumbnails.
26-08-2018T16:52:01,CrimsonQuill,Ok...
26-08-2018T16:52:11,iliar,Read The Fucking Manual
26-08-2018T16:52:17,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
26-08-2018T16:52:53,Bgrmystr2,"I never said the dragon date was swapped, I was only using it as an example that there's multiple resolutions of an image cached on the page."
26-08-2018T16:53:03,iliar,But I do not perceive thumbnails as files.
26-08-2018T16:53:26,iliar,This is stupid.
26-08-2018T16:54:30,Bgrmystr2,"preaching to the choir, Iliar"
26-08-2018T16:54:46,iliar,"I see only one file. In Patreon API this file named as ""post_file""."
26-08-2018T16:56:06,CrimsonQuill,Space.
26-08-2018T16:56:12,iliar,And the bot downloads exactly this file.
26-08-2018T16:56:16,CrimsonQuill,Stars.
26-08-2018T16:56:36,CrimsonQuill,Lots of stars. Seriously-it's beautiful outside.
26-08-2018T16:56:52,CrimsonQuill,"I saw a meteor shower about a month ago, as a matter of fact..."
26-08-2018T16:57:10,CrimsonQuill,The Perseids one. Imagine that being put in a sketch.
26-08-2018T16:57:55,CrimsonQuill,"And yes, I know this has nothing to do with the thumbnails thing, It's just that I don't know about that, and I have a lot of stargazing on my mind."
26-08-2018T17:05:41,Bgrmystr2,Here ya go Iliar. Perfect example of what I'm saying. Right clicking the image gives you 1600x1213. Which is supposed to be the thumbnail.
26-08-2018T17:05:47,Bgrmystr2,https://www.patreon.com/posts/fellow-wolf-20105330
26-08-2018T17:05:51,CrimsonQuill,Bye guys
26-08-2018T17:06:23,Bgrmystr2,"if you zoom in the image and then right click and view image, it's 1583x1200"
26-08-2018T17:06:28,Bgrmystr2,which is smaller
26-08-2018T17:06:48,Bgrmystr2,"thus it's a reverse of what it's supposed to do, IE, what it did with the dinner date"
26-08-2018T17:07:39,Bgrmystr2,so patreon accidentally swapped what is supposed to be the thumbnail image size with the real image.
26-08-2018T17:09:22,Bgrmystr2,"there are a few others in the past where that happened, but that one was the most recent uploaded image that it happened to."
26-08-2018T17:12:27,Bgrmystr2,"And if that one isn't big enough of a difference, this one does it too. https://www.patreon.com/posts/drunk-eric-19749677"
26-08-2018T17:13:41,Bgrmystr2,"the one that's supposed to be the thumbnail is 1600x1119 while when you zoom the image in and view that one, it's 1440x1007"
26-08-2018T17:13:56,Bgrmystr2,which is a smaller resolution when it's supposed to be bigger.
26-08-2018T17:14:27,Bgrmystr2,and that's just two. There's more even further back
26-08-2018T17:15:09,iliar,Yes this is a good example.
26-08-2018T17:15:21,iliar,This is what I'm talking about.
26-08-2018T17:15:51,iliar,Open both files. And you will see the same quality.
26-08-2018T17:16:46,iliar,In this case more pixels not get more quality.
26-08-2018T17:19:03,iliar,Open both files and try to find the difference.
26-08-2018T17:19:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah I'm seeing differences.
26-08-2018T17:20:06,iliar,Placebo
26-08-2018T17:20:10,Bgrmystr2,no
26-08-2018T17:20:55,Bgrmystr2,"I'm zooming all the way and I can literally see the pixels differ. It's not by much, but it's there"
26-08-2018T17:21:48,iliar,Of course they are different. Different resolution - different pixels.
26-08-2018T17:22:01,iliar,I'm talking about quality
26-08-2018T17:22:26,Bgrmystr2,"they are close, but because one is bigger, the transition from white to blue is much more smooth. The smaller one has more abrupt transitions That, right there, is part of quality"
26-08-2018T17:24:25,iliar,Smooth gradients it's artefacts software resize.
26-08-2018T17:25:26,iliar,Increase the resolution of the image using Photoshop. And you will get the same result.
26-08-2018T17:25:50,Bgrmystr2,"it's only on certain parts of the image, so it wasn't cleanly lowered in resolution either. Some pixels are missing, like from the heart in eric's speach, making the hearts thinner for example. That's the subtle differences that make the 1600 image better"
26-08-2018T17:26:27,Bgrmystr2,"they aren't increasing the resolution, the 1600 was the original image, the 1440 is the lower quality."
26-08-2018T17:26:46,Bgrmystr2,"this subtle difference is not from increasing the resolution of an image, it's from lowering it."
26-08-2018T17:27:48,Bgrmystr2,"if you increased the 1440 to 1600, it would look way more blurry with artifacts dotting the edges, and that's because upscaling images does not work nearly as well as downscaling"
26-08-2018T17:30:08,Bgrmystr2,"you think they're upscaling, but they're not. They're downscaling a bigger image. They have no reason to upscale an image as it would take pointless time implementing something in the site that has to upscale the image to begin with"
26-08-2018T17:30:12,Bgrmystr2,and then increase server costs
26-08-2018T17:30:22,Bgrmystr2,cuz of how many people view that image
26-08-2018T17:30:25,iliar,I'm tired of arguing with an idiot.
26-08-2018T17:31:04,Bgrmystr2,"""an idiot"" I'd suggest looking in a mirror and educate yourself on how this works, because you clearly do not know nearly as much as you think you do./"
26-08-2018T17:31:19,Bgrmystr2,This isn't rocket science.
26-08-2018T17:31:36,iliar,"When I ran into this problem, I spent a lot of time to understand how Patreon engine works."
26-08-2018T17:31:54,Bgrmystr2,"and yet still, you think they upscale the image"
26-08-2018T17:31:58,Bgrmystr2,you have failed.
26-08-2018T17:33:31,Bgrmystr2,"It's not patreon that you don't understand, it's the difference between upscaling and downscaling"
26-08-2018T17:35:48,iliar,"If you like software resize images, just enjoy https://yadi.sk/d/NNaRdLo63acQEd"
26-08-2018T17:37:34,iliar,I've experimented with this a lot. In some cases Patreon increases the image resolution.
26-08-2018T17:38:33,Bgrmystr2,"If patreon were to increase the resolution, they'd do it to EVERY single image, or they'd do it to certain sizes, and that's just not the case. What you are looking at is a bug."
26-08-2018T17:43:30,iliar,"Okay. How about this option. We ask Tom what resolution was the file ""Drunk Eric"" what he uploaded to Patreon. The losing party pays $20 as a fee for concern."
26-08-2018T17:43:47,Bgrmystr2,"We can ask, but I'm not betting money on it."
26-08-2018T17:44:15,iliar,Are you not sure of your rightness?
26-08-2018T17:45:11,Bgrmystr2,Oh I'm sure of my rightness. I just value my money moreso than this conversation.
26-08-2018T17:45:42,iliar,"If you are right, you do not lose anything."
26-08-2018T17:45:46,Bgrmystr2,"Money is irrelevant, you just want to make a buck."
26-08-2018T17:46:22,Bgrmystr2,"If I'm wrong, I'll own up to it. That has more value than money anyway."
26-08-2018T17:47:47,iliar,I't mean you are not sure of your rightness.
26-08-2018T17:48:17,iliar,I see no reason to continue this conversation.
26-08-2018T17:48:22,Bgrmystr2,"No, you're just trying to bully me into paying money. I don't have to do anything."
26-08-2018T17:48:39,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not obligated to give you anything, remember that."
26-08-2018T17:48:51,Bgrmystr2,"Whether or not you're right, I'm still not obligated."
26-08-2018T17:49:05,iliar,You do not want to read the documentation. You do not want to be responsible for your words.
26-08-2018T17:49:34,Bgrmystr2,Coming from the guy who wants to runaway? :) I'm not paying you anything. That doesn't mean I'm not going to be irresponsible.
26-08-2018T17:49:41,Bgrmystr2,Not everything is money.
26-08-2018T17:50:09,iliar,"Just in case, I will clarify. I meant to send money to Tom."
26-08-2018T17:50:14,Bgrmystr2,not going to be responsible* rather bad wording there.
26-08-2018T17:50:38,Bgrmystr2,"You do what you want to do, I'm going to find out and move on."
26-08-2018T17:50:59,iliar,I don't want to distract him because of such stupidity.
26-08-2018T17:51:36,iliar,"So, in any case, I will not earn anything"
26-08-2018T17:52:09,Bgrmystr2,"You're not supposed to. That's not how anything works. You don't bet money on debates, that's how everyone loses."
26-08-2018T17:52:22,iliar,In my time zone 1:52AM.
26-08-2018T17:52:38,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't want money even if I was right
26-08-2018T17:53:08,iliar,And I need a good reason to continue this stupid conversation.
26-08-2018T17:53:36,Bgrmystr2,"I don't. If you wanna go to sleep, go to sleep."
26-08-2018T17:53:53,CrRAR,"I'd probably hop in the side of the boat that patreon does no upscaling.  You can view the originally uploaded res by clicking to preview, then right clicking and selecting ""open in new tab""."
26-08-2018T17:54:51,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that was my point that sometimes patreon accidentally backwards them, Cr"
26-08-2018T17:54:52,CrRAR,A lot of times the wallpaper size ones are 1920x1200. That's what Tom most usually makes available for finished works.
26-08-2018T17:55:40,CrRAR,like downscales? Yeah any preview is pretty much.
26-08-2018T17:55:45,Bgrmystr2,"These two are reversed, in which the ""original"" image uploaded is actually the downscaled one https://www.patreon.com/posts/drunk-eric-19749677"
26-08-2018T17:55:51,Bgrmystr2,https://www.patreon.com/posts/fellow-wolf-20105330
26-08-2018T17:56:26,Bgrmystr2,"like when you click into it to get the preview, and view image, it's smaller than the other."
26-08-2018T17:58:09,CrRAR,"Oh interesting, yeah the Kat x Eric one is pretty small."
26-08-2018T17:58:47,CrRAR,The Fellow Wolf one is 1583 x 1200 tho.
26-08-2018T18:00:05,CrRAR,Any image upscaled to an atrocious degree will have gnarly interpolation. There'd be obvious aliasing and other anomalies.
26-08-2018T18:00:19,Bgrmystr2,"if you right click and view the image without clicking to preview, it's 1600x1213"
26-08-2018T18:00:30,Bgrmystr2,the fellow wolf one
26-08-2018T18:00:39,CrRAR,yeah
26-08-2018T18:00:46,Bgrmystr2,so it's backwards from normal
26-08-2018T18:02:21,ferociousfox,Is there a stream for today?
26-08-2018T18:02:29,CrRAR,I wonder if the Drunk Eric one is just small because Tom started drawing in a small area and just went with it?
26-08-2018T18:02:53,CrRAR,Not likely ferocious
26-08-2018T18:03:02,Bgrmystr2,"it's debatable, the stream"
26-08-2018T18:03:08,CrRAR,tru
26-08-2018T18:03:23,CrRAR,Did he wrap up after Rose last night?
26-08-2018T18:03:23,ferociousfox,I thought he said he'd finish coloring today
26-08-2018T18:03:26,Bgrmystr2,"tom said he'd probably do the last color from sunday today, but he didn't say if he would stream it"
26-08-2018T18:03:38,CrRAR,ahh i see
26-08-2018T18:04:27,CrRAR,Wait so what was the main issue between upscaling vs downscaling? xD
26-08-2018T18:06:00,Bgrmystr2,cuz iliar thinks that patreon is upscaling the images like fellow wolf / drunk eric to make them larger than tom uploads them..
26-08-2018T18:06:13,iliar,The main problem is which file to download the bot.
26-08-2018T18:08:23,CrRAR,"i see, those ones seem to be atypical though."
26-08-2018T18:09:29,iliar,"My bot downloads a file that Patreon marked as ""post_file"". But sometimes other files have bigger resolution than ""post_file""."
26-08-2018T18:09:31,Bgrmystr2,"yeah Cr, they are very rare and have no rhyme or reason within them"
26-08-2018T18:10:31,CrRAR,wait so do you ever see any images larger than 1920x1200?
26-08-2018T18:10:34,iliar,"The problem occurs if the ""post_file"" has a non-typical resolution."
26-08-2018T18:10:41,CrRAR,ohhh
26-08-2018T18:10:50,Bgrmystr2,"a couple times, Cr yes actually"
26-08-2018T18:11:01,CrRAR,hmm
26-08-2018T18:11:05,Bgrmystr2,though it's most likely tom accidentally uploading a wrong image
26-08-2018T18:11:17,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's super high resolution images
26-08-2018T18:11:20,iliar,Funny fact. Sometimes a bot downloads files in a resolution much larger than what you see.
26-08-2018T18:11:46,CrRAR,Well what I find interesting is that if you inspect the rightclick to new tab image the res is set in HTML.
26-08-2018T18:12:08,CrRAR,I wonder if that value is passed from the original upload?
26-08-2018T18:12:44,Bgrmystr2,https://www.patreon.com/posts/wwii-pinup-rose-20821851 4635x3150
26-08-2018T18:12:50,iliar,"Bot use API, not HTML"
26-08-2018T18:13:30,CrRAR,interesting
26-08-2018T18:14:04,Bgrmystr2,"there was at least one other time that I can remember a bigger resolution, but I don't recall which image it was"
26-08-2018T18:14:19,iliar,For example bot download Private Muse in 5760*3600
26-08-2018T18:15:26,CrRAR,"See what I think is happening is that patreon is taking the image at upload and recording the native res then setting what the scale should be in HTML where it needs to. The ""right-click open in new tab"" is the native res. You CAN set it bigger in HTML."
26-08-2018T18:15:34,CrRAR,That would make it look lousy though.
26-08-2018T18:15:38,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that was the other one, the one Iliar noted"
26-08-2018T18:16:00,CrRAR,Most likely those larger exceptions Tom uploaded at that res.
26-08-2018T18:16:21,Bgrmystr2,"that's what I think, the larger images are uploads"
26-08-2018T18:16:22,CrRAR,...becaise Pircarto recorded the full size value at upload.
26-08-2018T18:16:30,CrRAR,*Patreon
26-08-2018T18:16:37,Bgrmystr2,lol know that feel
26-08-2018T18:16:42,CrRAR,hahaha
26-08-2018T18:17:33,CrRAR,Yeah Patron sets the res in HTML because it needs to display an image efficiently in a few different views without needing to store multiple versions of the image.
26-08-2018T18:18:10,CrRAR,"Wall-view vs Expanded view vs ""open in new tab view"""
26-08-2018T18:18:21,CrRAR,also mobile as well
26-08-2018T18:18:42,Bgrmystr2,"It's my opinion that patreon has a bug where the uploaded image they take is erronously marked to be set to the thumbnail, and when they downscale the image to create the thumbnail, they post that one in the other slot which is supposed to be the full res"
26-08-2018T18:19:26,Bgrmystr2,they aren't going to spend time upscaling random pictures for no reason.
26-08-2018T18:19:37,CrRAR,you're... not wrong. haha
26-08-2018T18:21:10,CrRAR,Yeah all images appear to be the originally uploaded one set in HTML to downscale to a certain extent depending on where it's displayed.
26-08-2018T18:21:30,Bgrmystr2,it's probably bugging out and putting them in the wrong place
26-08-2018T18:21:33,iliar,I think they have some typical resolution for thumbnails. If file have smaller untypical resolution they upscaling it.
26-08-2018T18:21:51,Bgrmystr2,they are not upscaling images lol
26-08-2018T18:22:10,Bgrmystr2,"for them to actually upscale it means they have to code and implement an upscaling system for uploaded files, and that would only increase the amount of strain on their servers"
26-08-2018T18:23:12,iliar,I noticed a similar problem with small images having a resolution of 1583 or something like that. They converting to 1600.
26-08-2018T18:23:57,CrRAR,By thumbnail do you mean the Wall where the newest stuff appears?
26-08-2018T18:24:19,Bgrmystr2,"I don't see any wall like that, CR, I just go to the page itself."
26-08-2018T18:24:38,iliar,"For the programmer, there is not much difference in reducing the image or increasing it."
26-08-2018T18:25:42,iliar,"So far I have not seen any evidence from you. Your whole theory is based on ""I think it's stupid."""
26-08-2018T18:25:51,CrRAR,"well there are different methods for both, Photoshop has like 5 to choose from."
26-08-2018T18:26:36,Bgrmystr2,"Then you're likely not looking, Iliar."
26-08-2018T18:26:38,CrRAR,Downscaling is ALWAYS preferable undoubtedly.
26-08-2018T18:27:20,Bgrmystr2,"Unfortunately, neither image was uploaded to deviantart so there isn't a place to doublecheck"
26-08-2018T18:27:45,CrRAR,but here you can see in the code that the image still carries it's full size but is constrained by the frame it's in. https://imgur.com/a/qpTu2ol
26-08-2018T18:28:21,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, and it's the bigger resolution"
26-08-2018T18:28:25,Bgrmystr2,not the smaller one
26-08-2018T18:28:40,iliar,You can use bicubic interpolation for upscaling and for downscaling
26-08-2018T18:28:40,CrRAR,"yeah ""Natural"""
26-08-2018T18:29:27,iliar,As I said I don't use HTML. I use API
26-08-2018T18:29:39,Bgrmystr2,"the website is what is limiting the image to 1583, you can see it on the bottom of your image, Cr"
26-08-2018T18:30:06,Bgrmystr2,so that just proves that the image is downscaled
26-08-2018T18:30:20,iliar,"Because the HTML that you see is generated by the script, using the data received through via API"
26-08-2018T18:30:37,CrRAR,"true yeah, I don't know what that discrepancy is."
26-08-2018T18:30:50,CrRAR,mmm
26-08-2018T18:31:31,CrRAR,"As long as you're getting the close to ""Natural"" res iliar you're getting the best version Tom provided to Patreon."
26-08-2018T18:31:45,CrRAR,...or whatever that slightly larger res is.
26-08-2018T18:31:48,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, it's the same on the drunk eric."
26-08-2018T18:34:37,Bgrmystr2,"""Max width 1440px"" https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/483781351582203925/dllhost_2018-08-27_18-34-05.png"
26-08-2018T18:35:02,Bgrmystr2,even though the image says 1600x1119
26-08-2018T18:35:44,Bgrmystr2,so the code itself is literally making the original image smaller so it can fit on the page
26-08-2018T18:36:50,Bgrmystr2,so why is it putting them in the wrong place..? Would be my question
26-08-2018T18:37:05,CrRAR,iiintersting. Yeah that one you can't even modify the res in browser like the others.
26-08-2018T18:37:48,CrRAR,like even when you right click and open in new tab
26-08-2018T18:38:16,Combak,"... Last I heard, API wasn't a programming language."
26-08-2018T18:38:53,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you can always right click the thumbnail and get the original image, Cr"
26-08-2018T18:39:22,Bgrmystr2,though it's a super long link

26-08-2018T18:40:10,CrRAR,"yeah, lol"
26-08-2018T18:40:38,CrRAR,still weird though
26-08-2018T18:43:01,iliar,"I'll try to explain how Patreon page is works. When you open page, site return blank page. Together with this page, a JavaScript is loaded. This JavaScript connecting to Patreon via API and get posts data. Then this script generated HTML code use this dat"
26-08-2018T18:45:40,iliar,This is the reason why I do not see the point of looking HTML code.
26-08-2018T18:47:20,Bgrmystr2,because the site clearly uses HTML code to display the image.
26-08-2018T18:47:52,Bgrmystr2,maybe you're not seeing the answer cuz you're ignoring the very thing that contains the answer in the first place.

26-08-2018T18:54:17,CrRAR,Yeah the mystery of the original res-es rages on. Patreon will never reveal itsss sssecrets~
26-08-2018T18:54:54,Bgrmystr2,haha I'll just ask tom when he jumps on

26-08-2018T18:59:20,iliar,The main source of information about post is the API. It does not matter how these data are used further. API main source.
26-08-2018T19:00:32,iliar,"I hope after you ask Tom if you are wrong, you have the courage to admit it."
26-08-2018T19:00:56,Bgrmystr2,Oh I will
26-08-2018T19:01:05,Bgrmystr2,don't you worry bout that
26-08-2018T19:02:18,Bgrmystr2,the least I can do is be a good role model. :P
26-08-2018T19:24:53,CrRAR,I still suspect that whatever res he's uploading to dA is what goes on patreon.
26-08-2018T19:37:26,Combak,"So, as far as I understand things, API is a short for... application programming interface. Wikipedia gives it a nice definition: ""a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software."""
26-08-2018T19:37:55,Combak,Are you accessing the API to have your bot do something iliar?
26-08-2018T19:39:18,Bgrmystr2,he probably went to sleep already
26-08-2018T19:39:42,CrRAR,Yeah think of APIs as a way for a custom program (his bot) to interface with another software/service to tap into its functions and assets.
26-08-2018T19:40:29,CrRAR,"For example you could write a 3rd party app to create a calendar event in Google Calendar using their API ""language""/functions."
26-08-2018T19:41:06,CrRAR,"or delete one, or modify it, etc etc"
26-08-2018T19:42:58,CrRAR,It allows inputs/outputs to an otherwise closed off ecosystem.

26-08-2018T23:09:50,Bgrmystr2,I has a question.
26-08-2018T23:10:15,Twokinds,:ptv-wondering:
26-08-2018T23:10:46,Bgrmystr2,what resolution did you upload the Fellow Wolf https://www.patreon.com/posts/fellow-wolf-20105330
26-08-2018T23:10:52,Bgrmystr2,and Drunk Eric at? https://www.patreon.com/posts/drunk-eric-19749677
26-08-2018T23:12:14,Bgrmystr2,I was trying to figure out why patreon reversed the original source image and the smaller thumnail
26-08-2018T23:12:57,Twokinds,Uh...
26-08-2018T23:13:28,Twokinds,fellow wolves is 1583 x 1200
26-08-2018T23:13:50,Bgrmystr2,hmm
26-08-2018T23:14:03,Ordithus,Patreon sometimes scales the image for some reason.
26-08-2018T23:14:09,Twokinds,Same resolution as it is on Patreon
26-08-2018T23:14:31,Bgrmystr2,cuz the website has fellow wolf at 1600x1213
26-08-2018T23:14:34,Bgrmystr2,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJ3IjoxNjAwfQ%3D%3D/patreon-posts/dQNC6NCCUOoCZkJLT6yE1UHC_zxIz9-5sp5iOpvfCPXcTKnYpfT7q2tMaP6EcHbS.png?token-time=1536624000&token-hash=1pQ1JT-qJGSCVSJmUSiRN4DjJRhiqM7gOctLhSV88MQ%3D
26-08-2018T23:14:51,Bgrmystr2,so I was trying to figure out why it did that
26-08-2018T23:15:00,Ordithus,"When you click on the image to view it ""large"", and then view it, it's at 1583 x 1200"
26-08-2018T23:15:20,Twokinds,"Well, I dunno"
26-08-2018T23:15:27,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, if you ignore that and just right click the thumbnail, and view, it's the bigger one, Ord"
26-08-2018T23:15:36,Ordithus,I think Patreon may just scale it to 1600 pixels wide in the default view?
26-08-2018T23:16:21,Ordithus,"Same deal with Peeping Squirrel.  View the default image, it's 1600 wide.  The full is 1920 x 1200"
26-08-2018T23:16:42,Ordithus,I think it's just Patreon being silly.
26-08-2018T23:16:46,Twokinds,Yeah I guess that's just how they default their normal view
26-08-2018T23:17:00,Bgrmystr2,"the drunk eric one is also strange, the image is 1600x1119, but the ""full view"" is smaller at 1440x1007"
26-08-2018T23:17:09,Twokinds,"Just click it so it pops up and then right click from there, you'll get the normal file."
26-08-2018T23:17:14,Twokinds,1440 is what's on my pc
26-08-2018T23:17:26,Bgrmystr2,"so unlike normal ones where the full view is larger, those two have the full view smaller"
26-08-2018T23:17:38,Twokinds,Yeah because apparently they just default to 1600 up or down
26-08-2018T23:17:48,Bgrmystr2,huh really
26-08-2018T23:17:48,ferociousfox,huh
26-08-2018T23:18:04,Twokinds,Just pop it up and then right click &gt; view image to see the natural version.
26-08-2018T23:18:21,Bgrmystr2,that's interesting
26-08-2018T23:18:34,Bgrmystr2,"okay, well shit xD"

26-08-2018T23:38:20,TheBeckoner,I actually had a really good day! Made some extra money at work. But am also very tired.
26-08-2018T23:39:11,TheBeckoner,I helped a guy fix his brake light switch and he paid me a bit for it (he didnt have to since all the work we do outside the store is volunteer stuff)
26-08-2018T23:39:11,Twokinds,Actually going out to the houses?
26-08-2018T23:39:16,Twokinds,I've wanted to do that.
26-08-2018T23:39:23,TheBeckoner,But Tom
26-08-2018T23:39:28,Ordithus,Yeah
26-08-2018T23:39:29,TheBeckoner,That requires leaving the house
26-08-2018T23:39:34,Twokinds,Yeah that's why I haven't.
26-08-2018T23:39:53,TheBeckoner,Do one of those VR things

26-08-2018T23:42:50,TheBeckoner,Yeah probably isn't widespread
26-08-2018T23:42:54,TheBeckoner,but i have seen it before
26-08-2018T23:43:34,Twokinds,That'd be nice. Put my Vive to use.
26-08-2018T23:43:43,TheBeckoner,Every time I try and subscribe it doesnt work. It will give a green check mark but then nothing happens
26-08-2018T23:43:58,TheBeckoner,Idk I never get charged so whatevs
26-08-2018T23:44:30,TheBeckoner,Yeah my buddy has a vive. Its pretty fun but sorta trippy if you have it on for along time
