21-03-2018T00:13:42,Dadrobit,"Just got back from the dollar theatre with my bro, went to get some dinner and see Thor: Ragnarok."
21-03-2018T00:14:22,Dadrobit,"Very funny movie, seems that Guardians of the Galaxy motif is rubbing off on the other Marvel universe movies"
21-03-2018T00:24:18,CrimsonHelsing,"Tom's on but no stream eh? Odd, yet curious, q&a?"
21-03-2018T00:24:42,Dadrobit,He's always lurking
21-03-2018T00:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Do the creep
21-03-2018T00:31:23,CrimsonHelsing,*creepy sigh* xD
21-03-2018T00:31:52,CrimsonHelsing,Ahh the Lonely Island xD
21-03-2018T00:32:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Something ran across my mind and idk if it’s just funny to me because I’m a little tired or what
21-03-2018T00:32:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"On a scale of one to nature valley granola bar, how crumbly is your relationship history"
21-03-2018T00:33:24,CrimsonHelsing,Anyone gonna answer that?
21-03-2018T00:33:56,Dadrobit,"I had one really solid relationship, and a few hilarious ones."
21-03-2018T00:34:07,unsteddyphoenix,Basically same
21-03-2018T00:34:17,unsteddyphoenix,Just trying to think of something else that's crumbly :thinking:
21-03-2018T00:34:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think it’s just funny, that description: nature valley granola bar"
21-03-2018T00:35:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"unsteddy, I do believe this is the first time I’ve seen you in a few days. Thought you died"
21-03-2018T00:35:15,Dadrobit,0.
21-03-2018T00:35:17,Dadrobit,0.o
21-03-2018T00:35:36,unsteddyphoenix,Fair
21-03-2018T00:35:54,Dadrobit,Seems a bit extreme
21-03-2018T00:36:25,unsteddyphoenix,I just dont really chat that much during the day. Except at designated talking hours
21-03-2018T00:36:27,unsteddyphoenix,(streams)
21-03-2018T00:36:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"In middle school, people thought i moved or had died because I got the chicken pox and was out a few days"
21-03-2018T00:37:04,unsteddyphoenix,Were they right?
21-03-2018T00:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep. Totally died
21-03-2018T00:37:46,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2: aw jeez
21-03-2018T00:37:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least I slept enough to qualify as dead
21-03-2018T00:38:09,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds great
21-03-2018T00:38:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Itchy, actually"
21-03-2018T00:38:21,Dadrobit,Never got the chicken pox I don't think...
21-03-2018T00:38:38,unsteddyphoenix,Uh oh.
21-03-2018T00:39:01,unsteddyphoenix,It's worse for adults to get it or whatever. Make sure you avoid kids like the plague.
21-03-2018T00:39:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I still have faint little scars on my arms
21-03-2018T00:39:22,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it turns into shingles or something"
21-03-2018T00:39:32,unsteddyphoenix,Ech D:
21-03-2018T00:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I got it at like 13 or 14. After two separate chicken pox vaccines
21-03-2018T00:40:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"From when I was younger, of course"
21-03-2018T00:40:39,unsteddyphoenix,think I got it even younger than that
21-03-2018T00:41:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Man, I watched The Room for the first time today"
21-03-2018T00:41:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though it’s debated if it was the chicken pox or an allergic reaction to men’s soap, as I was sleeping over at a friend’s when the spots started appearing"
21-03-2018T00:41:49,Dadrobit,How do you feel not?
21-03-2018T00:42:02,unsteddyphoenix,Awed
21-03-2018T00:42:02,Dadrobit,now*
21-03-2018T00:42:05,unsteddyphoenix,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvlYPSrkU8
21-03-2018T00:42:10,unsteddyphoenix,This scene absolutely killed me
21-03-2018T00:42:18,unsteddyphoenix,What a complete amazing disaster
21-03-2018T00:43:51,SpazztasticKiwi,What a...spirit killer
21-03-2018T00:44:02,Dadrobit,There was better acting in my Acting 101 class
21-03-2018T00:44:18,Dadrobit,"Like, legitimately"
21-03-2018T00:44:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Toddlers can be more convincing
21-03-2018T00:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,“I don’t know who took the candy” with chocolate all over the face an half the body
21-03-2018T00:45:52,unsteddyphoenix,Everything about it is so appalling that it's incredible
21-03-2018T00:46:07,unsteddyphoenix,It really does seem like it was supposed to be intentionally bad but it wasnt
21-03-2018T00:46:38,SpazztasticKiwi,“You tried” sticker
21-03-2018T00:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,⭐️
21-03-2018T00:46:57,Dadrobit,perfect
21-03-2018T00:48:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know the other night I almost called an exorcist because Bagheera kept doing the 1,000 yard stare at my ceiling"
21-03-2018T00:48:55,SpazztasticKiwi,The an eight-legged nope started drooping down towards my pillow
21-03-2018T00:51:44,unsteddyphoenix,You're haunted :0
21-03-2018T00:51:49,Bgrmystr2,"how'd that go, kiwi? xD"
21-03-2018T00:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I turned my hairdryer on it
21-03-2018T00:52:18,Dadrobit,That's one way to do it
21-03-2018T00:52:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"It high tailed it back up to the ceiling, where I swatted it away"
21-03-2018T00:53:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unfortunately, I never found a body"
21-03-2018T00:53:23,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
21-03-2018T00:53:30,Dadrobit,"Nasy nope, or a daddy longleg?"
21-03-2018T00:53:36,Dadrobit,Nasty*
21-03-2018T00:53:49,Bgrmystr2,lol you mean a daddylongnope :P
21-03-2018T00:54:00,Dadrobit,I like daddy longlegs :(
21-03-2018T00:54:06,Bgrmystr2,many people do
21-03-2018T00:54:09,Bgrmystr2,but they're still spiders
21-03-2018T00:54:13,Bgrmystr2,and many more still hate them
21-03-2018T00:54:16,Bgrmystr2,because spider.
21-03-2018T00:54:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cellar nope - looks like a longlegs, but stretched a little thinner"
21-03-2018T00:54:27,unsteddyphoenix,Very unfair
21-03-2018T00:54:43,unsteddyphoenix,Spoiders are people too
21-03-2018T00:55:14,Dadrobit,"I'm horrified of spiders, but they're actually super cute imo."
21-03-2018T00:55:17,Dadrobit,All gangly
21-03-2018T00:55:21,Bgrmystr2,"Every time I see a spider, I tend to worry a bit. Around here, the brown recluse is very common, but so are other spiders that look exactly like it..."
21-03-2018T00:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t mind a little nope sitting and minding it’s buisness, living it’s life"
21-03-2018T00:55:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I mind when they invade my personal bubble
21-03-2018T00:55:46,Bgrmystr2,"So every time I see a spider, I can't tell if it's dangerous as fuck and kill with fire, or just get rid of it"
21-03-2018T00:56:07,Bgrmystr2,"but I don't see spiders for the most part, thankfully"
21-03-2018T00:56:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Brown recluses have a dark brown or black fiddle on their back
21-03-2018T00:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Literally, that’s what it looks like"
21-03-2018T00:56:38,unsteddyphoenix,We have no poisonous spiders so
21-03-2018T00:56:44,Dadrobit,Lucky
21-03-2018T00:56:52,unsteddyphoenix,They just kill bugs for me
21-03-2018T00:57:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Poisonous means you bite it and you die; venomous is it bites you and you die
21-03-2018T00:57:47,Bgrmystr2,what if I bite it and it dies?
21-03-2018T00:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re the poisonous one
21-03-2018T00:58:02,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
21-03-2018T00:58:15,Bgrmystr2,"wait, wouldn't I be the venomous one then?"
21-03-2018T00:58:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"No, wait. You bite it you’re venomous if it dies"
21-03-2018T00:58:43,Bgrmystr2,okay so what happens if it bites me and it dies?
21-03-2018T00:58:57,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re poisonous
21-03-2018T00:59:03,Bgrmystr2,you've got this down
21-03-2018T00:59:05,Bgrmystr2,I'm impressed.
21-03-2018T00:59:14,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
21-03-2018T00:59:22,Dadrobit,What if it bites me and it lives forever?
21-03-2018T00:59:28,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
21-03-2018T00:59:32,Bgrmystr2,I..
21-03-2018T00:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,You got that vampire blood
21-03-2018T00:59:48,Bgrmystr2,"well fuck, Kiwi's got an answer for everything."
21-03-2018T01:00:01,Bgrmystr2,Where were you when we needed you like last year
21-03-2018T01:00:10,Bgrmystr2,for that one random conversation that noone remembers
21-03-2018T01:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,If the two of you bite each other and no one dies...?
21-03-2018T01:00:50,unsteddyphoenix,Oh that one
21-03-2018T01:00:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinky
21-03-2018T01:00:58,Bgrmystr2,haha
21-03-2018T01:01:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Or so I’ve heard
21-03-2018T01:02:01,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
21-03-2018T01:02:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve got plenty of bad jokes and snide comments. Plenty of people say I’m funny, but I really think it’s my knack to poke at things and say how I see them"
21-03-2018T01:03:25,unsteddyphoenix,I think there's a difference between having a developed sense of humour and being funny.
21-03-2018T01:03:51,Bgrmystr2,"would agree with that, phoenix"
21-03-2018T01:04:33,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a difference between cracking a good joke and using shock humor
21-03-2018T01:05:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s bapping my screen. I’m going to let him try typing something
21-03-2018T01:06:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Getgfvb
21-03-2018T01:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,He tried
21-03-2018T01:07:11,unsteddyphoenix,I understand completely
21-03-2018T01:07:21,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: I'm going to have to meditate on what he said. It's not something I've thought about before.
21-03-2018T01:07:38,Bgrmystr2,"getting gfvb could be completely rational, just.."
21-03-2018T01:07:41,Bgrmystr2,huh.
21-03-2018T01:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It was trying to autocorrect to “geography” at first
21-03-2018T01:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Secret agent cat?
21-03-2018T01:08:42,Bgrmystr2,since when has autocorrect known what a human wants to say? Nevermind a cat
21-03-2018T01:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Or gfvb is an anagram “Get g.f.v.b.”
21-03-2018T01:09:54,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe it was for cats the whole.time and that's why it doesn't work for humans
21-03-2018T01:10:15,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: could be, phoenix.."
21-03-2018T01:10:17,Bgrmystr2,could be
21-03-2018T01:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Or he’s telling me to get off my phone and pet him
21-03-2018T01:11:06,unsteddyphoenix,gotta learn to multitask
21-03-2018T01:11:07,Dadrobit,"I thought it looks suspiciously like ""get food"""
21-03-2018T01:11:24,Bgrmystr2,possibly
21-03-2018T01:11:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have cat treats next to the bed
21-03-2018T01:11:39,Bgrmystr2,it may be trying to tell us that Kiwi doesn't feed em correctly
21-03-2018T01:11:44,Bgrmystr2,or not often?
21-03-2018T01:11:50,Bgrmystr2,or incorrect meals perhaps
21-03-2018T01:12:06,unsteddyphoenix,Never enough
21-03-2018T01:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Noms have been poured into dish. Crunching happily
21-03-2018T01:13:20,unsteddyphoenix,Message received
21-03-2018T01:14:02,Dadrobit,Nailed it!
21-03-2018T01:14:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s legitimately always hungry. Even after I pour him breakfast and he has that, he circles back for more minutes later"
21-03-2018T01:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"He even has access to noms whenever he wants - it’s in another room because Kiwi’s on a diet, but all he has to do is alert someone to go get the door"
21-03-2018T01:16:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if the door didn’t require more weight to open, he’d do it himself - he knows how it works"
21-03-2018T01:23:01,Bgrmystr2,"oh, nice you guys figured it out"
21-03-2018T01:23:02,Bgrmystr2,well done
21-03-2018T01:23:09,Bgrmystr2,I was having my head talked off while eating
21-03-2018T01:23:21,Bgrmystr2,instead of being able to talk to you guys and watch this anime
21-03-2018T01:23:36,Dadrobit,tragic
21-03-2018T01:23:39,Bgrmystr2,I get to listen to woes of teacher shit :ptv-uneasy:
21-03-2018T01:24:01,Bgrmystr2,exactly what I wanted to watch while I eat.
21-03-2018T01:25:45,Bgrmystr2,oh it's THIS song.. from sage's stream
21-03-2018T01:25:50,Bgrmystr2,that's why I have this on my watch list.
21-03-2018T01:30:51,unsteddyphoenix,Teachers suffer man
21-03-2018T01:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,Idk why people do it
21-03-2018T01:31:10,Bgrmystr2,That they do
21-03-2018T01:35:22,Dadrobit,"As a descendant of teachers, can confirm"
21-03-2018T01:35:52,Dadrobit,"Both parents, 3 of my granparents, at least one of my great grandparents..."
21-03-2018T01:50:58,unsteddyphoenix,My mother's one. She has some stories...
21-03-2018T01:54:36,Dadrobit,"I bet, what's she teach?"
21-03-2018T02:00:07,unsteddyphoenix,Primary school. Like 10 year olds.
21-03-2018T02:00:39,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly half the complaints are about the other teachers though.
21-03-2018T02:01:09,unsteddyphoenix,"They all sounds just, super unmotivated. Which seems bad for young kids."
21-03-2018T02:02:31,Dadrobit,"Mother had that issue when she taught Junior High, when she started high school it cleared a lot of that up, now it's just lazy/incompetent admin."
21-03-2018T02:03:27,Dadrobit,"Pops always taught hih school, always had issues with incompetent admin. Got fired from one school after he called the principal an idiot to his face."
21-03-2018T02:03:32,Dadrobit,igh*
21-03-2018T02:03:40,Dadrobit,hihg**
21-03-2018T02:03:43,Dadrobit,high***
21-03-2018T02:03:45,Dadrobit,Fuck
21-03-2018T02:03:49,unsteddyphoenix,You made it
21-03-2018T02:03:59,Dadrobit,\o/
21-03-2018T02:04:27,unsteddyphoenix,Dont teachers have tenure or whatever
21-03-2018T02:04:37,Dadrobit,Not in Arizona
21-03-2018T02:04:43,unsteddyphoenix,Unfortunate
21-03-2018T02:05:29,Dadrobit,"They technically have a union, got kicked out after he tried to get a strike going after the city froze their pay."
21-03-2018T02:06:56,unsteddyphoenix,Wow
21-03-2018T02:07:00,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds very political
21-03-2018T02:07:11,Dadrobit,You would not fucking believe
21-03-2018T02:08:45,Dadrobit,"City loves him now, he was nominated Arizona's teacher of the year a few years ago and he was awared ""teacher who makes a difference"" just a few weeks back."

21-03-2018T02:09:25,Dadrobit,#Truth
21-03-2018T02:10:14,Dadrobit,They gave him a little glass plaque and a $50 Amazon gift card.
21-03-2018T02:10:15,unsteddyphoenix,What a good reward
21-03-2018T02:10:24,unsteddyphoenix,Cute~
21-03-2018T02:10:31,unsteddyphoenix,"*award, rather"
21-03-2018T02:11:34,Dadrobit,":( I almost didn't get to see him recieve it, mom only found out the day of because he didn't tell anyone."
21-03-2018T02:12:07,Dadrobit,He hates making a deal out of stuff like this.
21-03-2018T02:12:48,Dadrobit,"On the plus side, he was super happy when I showed up at city hall out of the blue for it."
21-03-2018T02:12:59,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
21-03-2018T02:13:02,unsteddyphoenix,I know the type
21-03-2018T02:13:06,unsteddyphoenix,"I am the type, kinda"
21-03-2018T02:13:42,unsteddyphoenix,I didnt go to my graduation despite people wanting me to
21-03-2018T02:13:47,TheBeckoner,yeah I can sympathize with that type. I also dislike things being made into ordeals.
21-03-2018T02:14:55,Twokinds,I wonder if I could watch all of Game of Thrones and Westworld in 7 days...
21-03-2018T02:16:21,TheBeckoner,Well they are all quantifiable amounts of time long...add em up.
21-03-2018T02:20:53,TheBeckoner,7 days is 168 hours fwiw
21-03-2018T02:21:03,unsteddyphoenix,Just go for Westworld
21-03-2018T02:21:13,unsteddyphoenix,"I need to rewatch that too actually, new seasons coming out"
21-03-2018T02:21:18,unsteddyphoenix,Barely remember it
21-03-2018T02:21:57,unsteddyphoenix,Allocate a bit more than a week for game of thrones
21-03-2018T02:22:13,Twokinds,"Well, the HBO free trial is only 7 days"
21-03-2018T02:22:31,Twokinds,and I don't want to pay money for it
21-03-2018T02:22:35,unsteddyphoenix,Oof.
21-03-2018T02:22:45,TheBeckoner,Welp I'm going to bed. Just finished an essay about drinking and what not. Night guys.
21-03-2018T02:22:55,Dadrobit,"Ahhhh, was thinking maybe an interesting season was coming up in a week or something"
21-03-2018T02:23:04,Dadrobit,Haven't watched any of either
21-03-2018T02:23:09,Dadrobit,Night Beck
21-03-2018T02:23:10,unsteddyphoenix,Just hammer out westworld and see how much time you have
21-03-2018T02:23:14,unsteddyphoenix,later beck
21-03-2018T02:25:13,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre both great imo so
21-03-2018T02:25:44,Twokinds,I'm more interested in Westworld so that's what I'll probably do.
21-03-2018T02:27:15,unsteddyphoenix,Could definitely watch that in a week
21-03-2018T02:29:40,Twokinds,It's 10 hours long. I could watch it on one sitting.
21-03-2018T02:32:59,Dadrobit,Reasonable enough
21-03-2018T02:34:09,unsteddyphoenix,I encvy people who can do that
21-03-2018T02:34:22,unsteddyphoenix,even when I enjoy the thing I cant do it for 10 hours
21-03-2018T02:35:10,Dadrobit,"Same, even if I'm just gaming, I gotta get up and do ~something~ after a few hours."
21-03-2018T02:36:11,Twokinds,I have an obsessive personality.
21-03-2018T02:38:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, people like that can get so much done"
21-03-2018T02:39:13,unsteddyphoenix,I have this friend who always becomes the best at most games 'cause of it
21-03-2018T02:40:47,Dadrobit,"I was like that for a game called MAG. That was a game I ~could~ binge on. Got stupid good at it, but it was also a healthy contributor to my failure as a young adult."
21-03-2018T02:42:41,Bgrmystr2,"how many hours did you end up putting into it, Dadro?"
21-03-2018T02:43:01,Dadrobit,In the thousands
21-03-2018T02:43:34,Bgrmystr2,"ah, okay"
21-03-2018T02:43:54,Bgrmystr2,"I have a few games I play like that, standard for me to get that much time played in em"
21-03-2018T02:44:20,Dadrobit,I think I posted about it somewhere on the forums not too terribly long ago..
21-03-2018T02:44:35,unsteddyphoenix,I suppose there are downsides too
21-03-2018T02:45:46,unsteddyphoenix,But still
21-03-2018T02:45:49,Dadrobit,"As much as I hate how much I let that game take control of my life, I do still kinda miss it from time to time. It was nice being absurdly good at something I liked doing."
21-03-2018T02:46:09,unsteddyphoenix,Hopefully I can experience that one day~
21-03-2018T02:46:15,unsteddyphoenix,Ive always been envious of that kind of focus
21-03-2018T02:47:41,Dadrobit,Example A: http://i.imgur.com/lKgLX2I.png

21-03-2018T02:48:01,Bgrmystr2,destroyed
21-03-2018T02:48:46,unsteddyphoenix,Damn you really Made America Great with that one
21-03-2018T02:49:14,Dadrobit,I see what you did there
21-03-2018T02:49:23,Dadrobit,It was actually a Massive Action Game
21-03-2018T02:51:55,Twokinds,I have game screencaps too
21-03-2018T02:52:14,unsteddyphoenix,Present it
21-03-2018T02:52:28,Twokinds,http://twokindscomic.com/images/tomsgameskillz.png
21-03-2018T02:52:47,Bgrmystr2,:ok_hand:
21-03-2018T02:52:52,unsteddyphoenix,Ok. What is this.
21-03-2018T02:53:06,unsteddyphoenix,How do I play it
21-03-2018T02:53:17,unsteddyphoenix,I thought only divinity had this kind of advnaced technology
21-03-2018T02:53:31,Twokinds,"Rimworld. First thing I did was tame a squirrel, after finding out I could."
21-03-2018T02:53:41,Dadrobit,Logical
21-03-2018T02:53:56,unsteddyphoenix,Just makes sense
21-03-2018T02:54:20,unsteddyphoenix,You played Kingdom Come Deliverance? Been looking at that.
21-03-2018T02:54:33,unsteddyphoenix,Looks really good
21-03-2018T02:56:13,Twokinds,I don't have time. And I'm not really into realistic fantasy.
21-03-2018T02:56:38,Dadrobit,"""realistic fantasy"""
21-03-2018T02:56:59,Twokinds,"Well, gritty fantasy, for lack of a better term."
21-03-2018T02:57:11,Twokinds,Same reason I never watched Game of Thrones.
21-03-2018T02:57:12,Dadrobit,"Naw, I getchu"
21-03-2018T02:57:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Shrug, fair. I've heard rave reviews though"
21-03-2018T02:57:48,Dadrobit,Heard mixed things
21-03-2018T02:58:58,Twokinds,2018 Signature Print on the way
21-03-2018T02:59:07,Twokinds,http://twokindscomic.com/images/2017signatureprint_preview.png
21-03-2018T02:59:23,Dadrobit,What's this?
21-03-2018T02:59:45,unsteddyphoenix,Ah you went with Raine for whatever this was
21-03-2018T02:59:48,Bgrmystr2,oh that's cool
21-03-2018T03:00:22,Bgrmystr2,Guessing all the previous books had prints like this too? Or is this only for the preorders or something?
21-03-2018T03:01:40,Twokinds,"Usually, they're just for conventions. They're something I sign for $5, if people just want something small and not a book or whatever."
21-03-2018T03:01:52,Bgrmystr2,ooh okay
21-03-2018T03:02:05,Dadrobit,ohhh
21-03-2018T03:02:17,Bgrmystr2,you sell the previous ones still?
21-03-2018T03:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I leave for five minutes and everything happens
21-03-2018T03:02:42,Twokinds,"Yeah, I usually bring a small number of the old ones to cons, if people want to have the whole series"
21-03-2018T03:02:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Raine’s lookin so pretty
21-03-2018T03:03:01,Twokinds,Thanks!
21-03-2018T03:03:12,Bgrmystr2,that's awesome
21-03-2018T03:03:14,Dadrobit,Too bad aboutbeing on the other side of the continent
21-03-2018T03:03:30,Bgrmystr2,the convention is on your side tho dadro lol :u
21-03-2018T03:03:32,Bgrmystr2,isn't it?
21-03-2018T03:03:34,Bgrmystr2,in cali
21-03-2018T03:03:53,Bgrmystr2,I'd like to go one day
21-03-2018T03:04:13,Dadrobit,Oh? SDCC?
21-03-2018T03:04:24,Bgrmystr2,I don't know?
21-03-2018T03:04:51,Twokinds,Yeah
21-03-2018T03:05:01,Twokinds,That's my primary convention
21-03-2018T03:05:08,Dadrobit,:/ tempting
21-03-2018T03:05:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
21-03-2018T03:05:52,Dadrobit,But mah monies are not very many
21-03-2018T03:06:38,Bgrmystr2,SDCC.. Small Device C Compiler :thinking:
21-03-2018T03:06:46,Bgrmystr2,This is not the convention I am looking for
21-03-2018T03:06:47,Dadrobit,San Diego Comic Con
21-03-2018T03:07:00,Bgrmystr2,Internet search has failed me
21-03-2018T03:07:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Son don't cut cucumbers
21-03-2018T03:07:11,Bgrmystr2,haha
21-03-2018T03:07:25,SpazztasticKiwi,How close is San Francisco to San Diego...?
21-03-2018T03:07:34,Bgrmystr2,couple hours I think?
21-03-2018T03:07:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,over 8 hour drive
21-03-2018T03:07:55,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, a couple"
21-03-2018T03:08:01,Dadrobit,10.5hrs
21-03-2018T03:08:07,Bgrmystr2,no big deal. :v
21-03-2018T03:08:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm that idea
21-03-2018T03:08:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it would be a 17 hour drive for me
21-03-2018T03:08:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I was gonna say “perfect - visit my grandpa and go to con”
21-03-2018T03:08:37,Bgrmystr2,"don't worry Kiwi, I'm in Louisiana. It's probably a 3-4 day drive"
21-03-2018T03:08:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Alabama
21-03-2018T03:08:56,Bgrmystr2,so you're in my boat
21-03-2018T03:09:06,unsteddyphoenix,wow sounds pretty hard for you guys
21-03-2018T03:09:08,unsteddyphoenix,:T
21-03-2018T03:09:11,Bgrmystr2,aw phoenix
21-03-2018T03:09:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,rip unsteddy
21-03-2018T03:09:23,Bgrmystr2,just dig underground through the planet
21-03-2018T03:09:26,Bgrmystr2,come out the other side
21-03-2018T03:09:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well if my mom had met my dad instead of my dad meeting my mom, I’d be in Illinois"
21-03-2018T03:09:49,Dadrobit,"Only about 5-6 from me, not bad, but tickest and swag is expensive."
21-03-2018T03:10:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,start saving now
21-03-2018T03:12:17,unsteddyphoenix,^
21-03-2018T03:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Is Raine not colored in yet or is she gonna be iridescent for that cover
21-03-2018T03:13:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause she’d look lovely iridescent
21-03-2018T03:14:34,Twokinds,lol it's just a sketch right now
21-03-2018T03:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know. Not saying to slap a unicorn filter on her, but her color scheme matches the look"
21-03-2018T03:15:43,unsteddyphoenix,Make her completely chrome
21-03-2018T03:15:58,Bgrmystr2,"ehhh, no rainbow filter, kiwi?"
21-03-2018T03:15:58,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s not a new car
21-03-2018T03:16:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Like the liquid terminator from T2
21-03-2018T03:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’ll turn back”? Or is that too off character
21-03-2018T03:18:42,Dadrobit,"You know what'd be cool, if she were sitting back to back with her alternate self?"
21-03-2018T03:18:54,Dadrobit,Or if her reflection on the ground was the alternate self
21-03-2018T03:19:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Be pretty cool
21-03-2018T03:19:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:musical_note:does my reflection show who i am inside:musical_note:
21-03-2018T03:19:42,Bgrmystr2,"ah that kind of thing, dadro"
21-03-2018T03:19:46,Bgrmystr2,those are cool
21-03-2018T03:19:53,Bgrmystr2,I always like to see when people do that with characters
21-03-2018T03:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I was going to make that joke but I decided against it to be serious for once
21-03-2018T03:20:35,Bgrmystr2,Missed your chance.
21-03-2018T03:20:37,Bgrmystr2,Disappointed
21-03-2018T03:20:47,SpazztasticKiwi,She does seem to have a problem with identity though so the mirror/reflection idea would fit
21-03-2018T03:22:31,Twokinds,Or make it a lenticular print! With the human version and wolf version showing up depending on the angle you hold it!
21-03-2018T03:22:42,Dadrobit,$$$$$
21-03-2018T03:22:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'd pay for that
21-03-2018T03:23:28,Twokinds,But then I couldn't sign it
21-03-2018T03:23:48,Bgrmystr2,that'd be awesome
21-03-2018T03:24:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Sign the back?
21-03-2018T03:24:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It can come with a signed post card
21-03-2018T03:24:18,unsteddyphoenix,that'd be really cool
21-03-2018T03:24:24,unsteddyphoenix,There might be some marker that could sign it
21-03-2018T03:24:47,Bgrmystr2,You talking about characters in a mirror with different versions of themselves made me recall this image I have
21-03-2018T03:24:51,Bgrmystr2,http://safebooru.org/images/231/59991dcb308695f5e2e098a38849a626c18fdac8.jpg
21-03-2018T03:25:40,Bgrmystr2,that's always a great connection
21-03-2018T03:26:00,Dadrobit,Maybe a paint marker.
21-03-2018T03:26:11,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah, could sign the back"
21-03-2018T03:26:23,Bgrmystr2,or it could have a border around it
21-03-2018T03:26:56,Twokinds,It'd be all bumpy
21-03-2018T03:27:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"My experience with paint markers is either too much, too little, or the cap comes off and it leaks everywhere"
21-03-2018T03:27:11,Twokinds,"You know, it's all angles. It'd be quite hard to write on with anything."
21-03-2018T03:27:20,Dadrobit,There are fine guage printing options that would mitigate it.
21-03-2018T03:28:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Could you sign it on the print before the effect is made so that your signature moves with the picture
21-03-2018T03:28:20,Twokinds,lpol
21-03-2018T03:28:29,Twokinds,lol
21-03-2018T03:28:34,Bgrmystr2,saw that
21-03-2018T03:28:40,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but part of the idea of getting a signature is that it's specialized and or unique"
21-03-2018T03:28:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,was wondering what that ment
21-03-2018T03:28:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I was so confused
21-03-2018T03:29:23,Dadrobit,"Like, I'm sure some people ask for phrases or things, he woun't be able to cleanly olige that."
21-03-2018T03:29:33,Dadrobit,wouldn't*
21-03-2018T03:29:38,unsteddyphoenix,True
21-03-2018T03:29:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Thought I was looking at a makeshift drowning person emoji
21-03-2018T03:29:41,Dadrobit,oblige*
21-03-2018T03:29:46,unsteddyphoenix,Could just make two types instead
21-03-2018T03:29:53,unsteddyphoenix,Then sign the normal type
21-03-2018T03:30:13,Dadrobit,You missed a TowKinds opportunity there unsteddy
21-03-2018T03:30:21,Twokinds,Maybe i'll just make a seperate print series
21-03-2018T03:30:23,Bgrmystr2,"lol marv, kiwi, you guys need to be better at identifying typos :P"
21-03-2018T03:30:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m using voice dictation OK
21-03-2018T03:30:41,Dadrobit,Twokinds* Speaking of typos
21-03-2018T03:32:01,Twokinds,"Then I could do one where Raine turns into a wolf, one where Mike turns into a girl, etc"
21-03-2018T03:32:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,people will go nuts for those
21-03-2018T03:32:29,Dadrobit,Trace/Dark Trace
21-03-2018T03:32:44,Dadrobit,Euchre
21-03-2018T03:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone unexposed to TK walls by the booth and wonders what exactly was in that sandwich they ate
21-03-2018T03:33:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the assassin bro you turn it and it turns and it go's from nat to zen and vise versa
21-03-2018T03:33:18,SpazztasticKiwi,“walks” not walls you stupid phone
21-03-2018T03:33:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wow I batch that sentence
21-03-2018T03:34:12,Bgrmystr2,"you botched your botch, too, marv."
21-03-2018T03:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a bad batch of cookies
21-03-2018T03:34:15,Bgrmystr2,guys jeez.
21-03-2018T03:34:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I blame this cold and the 4 hours of sleep last night
21-03-2018T03:34:44,SpazztasticKiwi,We need to go to bed. Our technology is sending subliminal messages
21-03-2018T03:35:10,Dadrobit,"Naw, I'm almost always like this"
21-03-2018T03:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I blame my Internet connection
21-03-2018T03:35:17,Twokinds,I'm headed to bed
21-03-2018T03:35:19,Twokinds,G'night!
21-03-2018T03:35:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Tom
21-03-2018T03:35:28,Dadrobit,"Have a good one, Tom."
21-03-2018T03:35:35,Bgrmystr2,gnight tom
21-03-2018T03:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok
21-03-2018T03:35:55,unsteddyphoenix,gniight
21-03-2018T03:35:55,SpazztasticKiwi,(Why do I not believe him?)
21-03-2018T03:36:23,Dadrobit,(Because you've been hurt too many times before?)
21-03-2018T03:36:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Ok, I’m done” *continues adding details*"
21-03-2018T03:36:58,SpazztasticKiwi,You could say that
21-03-2018T03:37:54,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s how I am with my family. We gotta be somewhere at 8? I’m up at 6:30 and ready by 7
21-03-2018T03:38:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone else’s still rushing around at 7:50
21-03-2018T03:38:55,Dadrobit,"Class at 1:30 tomorrow, I'm still probably gonna pass out here in a bit, but my engagements are well planned around my poor sleep habits."
21-03-2018T03:39:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Afternoon classes. Gotta love em
21-03-2018T03:39:40,Bgrmystr2,"lol you only take a half hour to get ready, jeez kiwi"
21-03-2018T03:39:42,Bgrmystr2,fast much
21-03-2018T03:39:46,Bgrmystr2,I take an hour to wake up usually
21-03-2018T03:39:57,Bgrmystr2,literal zombie
21-03-2018T03:40:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t wear makeup often, and my clothes are neatly stacked. Grab outfit and go"
21-03-2018T03:40:29,Bgrmystr2,must be nice :ptv-wondering:
21-03-2018T03:40:43,Bgrmystr2,Wish I had the benefit of being able to wake up and go that quickly
21-03-2018T03:40:51,SpazztasticKiwi,My hair’s generally a lost cause. It’s either in a ponytail or down
21-03-2018T03:41:17,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s another reason I get up so early. I can take my time some days if I want
21-03-2018T03:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,It also gives me time to hug my children goodbye
21-03-2018T03:43:24,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: that'll do it
21-03-2018T03:43:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cats, that is - I feel the need to clarify this since someone actually thought Kiwi was my 5 year old daughter"
21-03-2018T03:43:48,Dadrobit,lol
21-03-2018T03:43:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD

21-03-2018T03:45:24,Bgrmystr2,almost.
21-03-2018T03:45:26,Bgrmystr2,then you ruined it
21-03-2018T03:45:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you really want a cat don't you unsteddy?
21-03-2018T03:45:32,Bgrmystr2,he does.
21-03-2018T03:45:34,Bgrmystr2,you can't tell?
21-03-2018T03:45:36,unsteddyphoenix,I do.

21-03-2018T03:46:20,Bgrmystr2,almost.
21-03-2018T03:46:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,There is nothing wrong with hugging your cat goodbye
21-03-2018T03:46:44,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, I know."
21-03-2018T03:46:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never given any hint I have actual kids
21-03-2018T03:47:05,Bgrmystr2,That was literally the biggest hint you could have possibly given
21-03-2018T03:47:07,Bgrmystr2,xD

21-03-2018T03:48:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell him not to touch or mess with something? He does. Tell him to leave his sister alone? Pesters her more.
21-03-2018T03:50:25,unsteddyphoenix,sounds about right
21-03-2018T03:50:27,SpazztasticKiwi,“What do you have?” or “Drop that!”: he runs off
21-03-2018T03:51:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s a really good cat, but when he has a day, he makes it the biggest"
21-03-2018T03:52:41,Dadrobit,Spent my teen years living with my older sibligs who all brought back babies and toddlers to the house in waves. It learned me good to not have any kids of my own.
21-03-2018T03:53:09,unsteddyphoenix,Oh god.
21-03-2018T03:53:41,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I still have nightmares about my baby half-sister and their dog.

21-03-2018T03:53:59,Dadrobit,The baby?

21-03-2018T03:56:57,Bgrmystr2,dogs have instincts that help them deal with babys and stuff

21-03-2018T04:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes the desire for kids turns into animal coddling

21-03-2018T04:02:41,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom had a problem with bringing me abandoned hamsters from the pet store until I got her to stop
21-03-2018T04:03:02,unsteddyphoenix,More impulse-animal shopping?
21-03-2018T04:03:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"No. She’ll rescue, nurse back to health, and try to rehome"

21-03-2018T04:07:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"The cats were kittens no one else wanted, as was the Pomeranian mixes"

21-03-2018T04:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"In fact, my Mom’s little pom mix was a mis breed; the chihuahua mother had apparently gotten out and bred with a Pomeranian"
21-03-2018T04:09:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"The owners didn’t like that. They ended up giving away the puppies, my mom’s being the runt, instead of the original plan to “get rid of them”"
21-03-2018T04:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"The pitbul was dropped off on our road, starving because she’d mis bred as well. We didn’t figure that out until a week before that year’s Christmas"

21-03-2018T04:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Oooo
21-03-2018T04:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Wait. I didn’t even look it up
21-03-2018T04:11:21,Dadrobit,This is gonna suck to not go.
21-03-2018T04:11:48,Bgrmystr2,I love how I look at the site
21-03-2018T04:11:51,Bgrmystr2,and it has NO date
21-03-2018T04:12:01,Bgrmystr2,like... nowhere on the front page
21-03-2018T04:12:01,Bgrmystr2,at all
21-03-2018T04:12:11,Bgrmystr2,that's a big fail if I've ever seen one
21-03-2018T04:12:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,july 19th - the 22nd
21-03-2018T04:12:44,Bgrmystr2,ah late july
21-03-2018T04:12:49,Dadrobit,"Probably because you're looking at the comic con disabiguation page, you need to specifically select SDCC"
21-03-2018T04:12:57,Dadrobit,disambiguation*
21-03-2018T04:13:19,Dadrobit,Since they have several events all tied together under the comic con banner
21-03-2018T04:13:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Likely not going to be able to go till 2019
21-03-2018T04:13:43,Bgrmystr2,"there is no SDCC. There's International, Wondercon, Toucan, and Comicon HQ"
21-03-2018T04:13:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Or later
21-03-2018T04:14:14,Dadrobit,The International is SDCC
21-03-2018T04:14:26,Bgrmystr2,how would I know lol
21-03-2018T04:14:26,Dadrobit,It says it in tiny print atop the logo
21-03-2018T04:14:28,Bgrmystr2,it ain't in the name
21-03-2018T04:15:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"The closest thing is Tupelo Con in Mississippi, and Tom may not know or be interested in that one"
21-03-2018T04:15:10,Bgrmystr2,"unlikely, kiwi"
21-03-2018T04:15:23,Bgrmystr2,the only other con he goes to that I know of is Momocon
21-03-2018T04:15:45,Dadrobit,I think Momocon he no longer goes to.
21-03-2018T04:15:55,Bgrmystr2,not true
21-03-2018T04:16:03,Bgrmystr2,Sage already said they were going there as guests
21-03-2018T04:16:14,Bgrmystr2,instead of as dealers
21-03-2018T04:16:23,Bgrmystr2,or artists?
21-03-2018T04:16:31,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno which area Tom would be in, honestly"
21-03-2018T04:16:37,Dadrobit,"Perhaps it was another con, but I recall Sage talking about one of the cons they used to go to they no longer did because of some behind the scenes bullshit."
21-03-2018T04:16:58,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: I recall that too, but I don't think it was momocon"
21-03-2018T04:17:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I believe sage said ""dick shaped people"""
21-03-2018T04:17:11,Bgrmystr2,could have been tho
21-03-2018T04:17:16,Dadrobit,That was it
21-03-2018T04:17:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Momo’s close, yes, but it’s close to my vacation. If I got off work, maybe my sister would be interested and join"
21-03-2018T04:17:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"But, then there’s traveling and whatever. I’d have to see getting closer"
21-03-2018T04:18:27,SpazztasticKiwi,But itd be unlikely
21-03-2018T04:21:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna try this sleep thing. I took an extra shift tomorrow
21-03-2018T04:21:26,Dadrobit,"Right on, have a good one Spazz."

21-03-2018T17:10:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,What do y'all think?
21-03-2018T17:12:23,Bgrmystr2,"""Capital of Earth"" lol"
21-03-2018T17:15:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,What?
21-03-2018T17:16:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, after talking with some other people, Jerusalem, Washington, DC, St. Petersburg, and Moscow are out due to political issues."
21-03-2018T17:17:40,Bgrmystr2,I always just find it hard to believe there can be one capital on a planet like ours
21-03-2018T17:17:46,Bgrmystr2,so filled with hatred and such
21-03-2018T17:18:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, this is the future so, you can fudge things a bit."
21-03-2018T17:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,L.A.?
21-03-2018T17:20:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,But @Bgrmystr2 where you put the capital of Earth then?
21-03-2018T17:20:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@SpazztasticKiwi  that's a good suggestion, but why would you put it there?"
21-03-2018T17:21:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s big, well talked about and seen as a to-go place, especially if you want to work in a creative career"
21-03-2018T17:22:46,Bgrmystr2,"I guess since it wasn't obscenely obvious, I wouldn't be able to put a ""capital of earth"" because there's too much strife."
21-03-2018T17:23:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like acting, animation, big-time comic creation, etc - show business and artistic niches alike are associated with L.A., as well as “success” in general"
21-03-2018T17:27:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm....Makes sense.  @Bgrmystr2 I knew what you were talking about, but if we started getting along, where would you put the capital of Earth in a scifi setting?"
21-03-2018T17:29:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Hello all, how goes"
21-03-2018T17:31:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,During good.  Just asking about where would put a capital of Earth in a scifi setting.
21-03-2018T17:31:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Hm. You writing a book?
21-03-2018T17:36:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,Pretty much.  Doing some world building.
21-03-2018T17:36:01,Dadrobit,"Here for just half a sec, but why woud you exclude a city for political issues? Those political issues would be a point to leverage in a plot, not ignore."
21-03-2018T17:36:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, yeah true."
21-03-2018T17:38:28,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"If I were to be logical about a city for the capital of Earth, it would make sense to make it in a place that's a center of commerce. It needs to be a powerful city. In America, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco; In Europe, London, Paris,  Rome;"
21-03-2018T17:38:38,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"in Asia, Tokyo or Shanghai"
21-03-2018T17:38:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Just to name a few
21-03-2018T17:38:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hm.....Interesting ideas KopyKat.  Thank you!
21-03-2018T17:39:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"You want there to be powerful commercial and political elements present in the capital, it should be the center, or at least the focus, of most things important."
21-03-2018T17:39:45,Dadrobit,"Berlin would be way more optimal than London, Paris or Rome."
21-03-2018T17:40:45,ThingsAreMoving,Just make it a megacity that covers the entire globe.
21-03-2018T17:40:46,ThingsAreMoving,ezpz
21-03-2018T17:40:56,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I think that there's a lot more history in the foundations of Rome or Paris, but that could be just because I'm not as well versed in the history of major German cities"
21-03-2018T17:41:24,Dadrobit,"History shmistory, Berlin is a place of power."
21-03-2018T17:41:51,Dadrobit,Rome and Paris are just tourist traps
21-03-2018T17:41:56,Dadrobit,No offense.
21-03-2018T17:42:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Eh. None taken
21-03-2018T17:42:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,And... I just realized that I'm like two hours early for the stream
21-03-2018T17:43:01,Dadrobit,Back to homework for me
21-03-2018T17:43:02,Dadrobit,o/
21-03-2018T17:46:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"@PalmettoPathfinder1, if you can't pick an existing city, you could always make one yourself. If it's and advanced sci-fi setting, you could make a neo-Atlantis island-city like Things said, and give it your own name."
21-03-2018T17:48:46,Bgrmystr2,Just finished Isekai Shokudou. Wasn't bad.
21-03-2018T17:49:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, the story does take place in 2115 AD."
21-03-2018T17:50:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,Excuse me 2153 AD.
21-03-2018T17:50:21,Bgrmystr2,"Personally, I'd make the people of the world think there is a capital, but not know where it is, like everyone thinks the capital is *this city* or *that city* cuz everyone important goes to those, but"
21-03-2018T17:50:37,Bgrmystr2,it'd really be on some massive land carrier out in the middle of the desert
21-03-2018T17:50:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Or just make it on the moon
21-03-2018T17:50:53,Bgrmystr2,the moon is cliche as hell tho
21-03-2018T17:50:54,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Capitol of the world, not even on the planet"
21-03-2018T17:50:59,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lol
21-03-2018T17:51:20,Bgrmystr2,A capital that isn't a capital
21-03-2018T17:51:30,Bgrmystr2,a large carrier that moves.. wherever it needs to be
21-03-2018T17:51:55,ItsActuallyKopyKat,That's a movie that is coming out soon!
21-03-2018T17:52:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Or did it already
21-03-2018T17:52:23,ItsActuallyKopyKat,mortal engines
21-03-2018T17:52:29,Bgrmystr2,"outside.. sandy and rusty.. the inside, technologically advanced enough to serve as command center for the globe"
21-03-2018T17:52:39,Bgrmystr2,noone would suspect it
21-03-2018T17:52:46,Bgrmystr2,sitting in the middle of nowhere
21-03-2018T17:53:16,Bgrmystr2,"also, I dunno what movie you're talkin about Kopy"
21-03-2018T17:54:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,Bgr just curious here but do you think we should build space colonies?
21-03-2018T17:55:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,That's what it's called. Mortal Engines. It comes out in December sometime.
21-03-2018T17:55:14,Bgrmystr2,ah
21-03-2018T17:55:17,Bgrmystr2,never heard of it
21-03-2018T17:55:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Eh. It looks like it could either be pretty good, or be a complete shit show"
21-03-2018T17:55:50,Bgrmystr2,"Palm, realistically, we should definitely go to space. Earth is a single planet. It's limited."
21-03-2018T17:57:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, how would you prevent our colonies from rebelling as well?"
21-03-2018T17:58:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Because in my story, shoving environmental protection laws down the throats of Martian miners isn't a good thing."
21-03-2018T17:58:41,Bgrmystr2,"Palm, I can't write your story for you"
21-03-2018T17:58:51,Bgrmystr2,"otherwise, it'd be my story, not yours"
21-03-2018T17:58:53,Bgrmystr2,:u
21-03-2018T17:58:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"That's sorta what happened in the Expanse series, really great books and a stellar tv adaptation"
21-03-2018T17:59:06,WIPKING,Does tom respond to some messages through wiapering or comic or chat
21-03-2018T17:59:18,WIPKING,Wispering
21-03-2018T17:59:24,Bgrmystr2,"tom responds rarely to the chat, he has whispers disabled"
21-03-2018T17:59:30,Bgrmystr2,because he displays the chat in the stream
21-03-2018T17:59:34,Bgrmystr2,for people who watch the vods later
21-03-2018T17:59:43,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Not really. You can't really expect him to answer every single message. Mostly just things that interest him
21-03-2018T17:59:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm...I really need to read that series and watch the series too.  Also, Bgr, I was asking for suggestions.  It never hurts to ask for ideas and inspirations from others."
21-03-2018T18:00:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Actually, I think Tom has it where you can't whisper him."
21-03-2018T18:00:11,Bgrmystr2,I just said that lol
21-03-2018T18:00:15,Bgrmystr2,:u
21-03-2018T18:00:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,Why you!?  You ninjaed me!
21-03-2018T18:00:37,Bgrmystr2,"no, you're just not paying attention"
21-03-2018T18:00:44,Bgrmystr2,come on palm xD
21-03-2018T18:00:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,No you ninjaed me!  My computer was just slow!
21-03-2018T18:01:01,Bgrmystr2,"nah, gotta get better"
21-03-2018T18:01:03,ItsActuallyKopyKat,*ninja'd
21-03-2018T18:01:19,WIPKING,Thays what i meant by some of course he not going to respond to everyone
21-03-2018T18:01:39,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Wait... then what was your question?
21-03-2018T18:01:40,Bgrmystr2,yeah he sometimes replies to stuff in the chat. Not commonly
21-03-2018T18:01:58,UnknownEnd,is in the chat
21-03-2018T18:02:02,ItsActuallyKopyKat,o/
21-03-2018T18:02:13,Bgrmystr2,and he doesn't usually state who he's replying to
21-03-2018T18:02:18,Bgrmystr2,so if 4 or 5 people ask questions
21-03-2018T18:02:21,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"aye, that too"
21-03-2018T18:02:29,Bgrmystr2,and he answers.. you dunno who he's replying to
21-03-2018T18:02:43,WIPKING,"If tom rsponds to people during streams, was my ?"
21-03-2018T18:02:51,Bgrmystr2,"and even so, tom does troll the chat sometimes"
21-03-2018T18:02:52,WIPKING,Dang
21-03-2018T18:03:01,Bgrmystr2,so his replies are sometimes questionable
21-03-2018T18:03:06,UnknownEnd,is  petting  his cat
21-03-2018T18:03:09,WIPKING,Absolute mad ladd
21-03-2018T18:03:14,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I like to think that those are the most memorable
21-03-2018T18:03:21,Bgrmystr2,right? Kat xD
21-03-2018T18:03:30,UnknownEnd,Nani?
21-03-2018T18:03:34,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Soft cat, @UnknownEnd?"
21-03-2018T18:03:42,Bgrmystr2,like all the patreon sketches being non-canon and canon simultaniously
21-03-2018T18:03:50,Bgrmystr2,he's said both
21-03-2018T18:04:05,WIPKING,2  more hours!!!!
21-03-2018T18:04:09,Bgrmystr2,"indeed, 2 more hours"
21-03-2018T18:04:13,UnknownEnd,Hmm?
21-03-2018T18:04:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"It;s really up to the viewer to decide; some of the sketches are really close to canon, and some are not."
21-03-2018T18:04:32,Bgrmystr2,"it's not difficult to tell, though Kat"
21-03-2018T18:04:40,Bgrmystr2,"most of them aren't going to legitimately be canon, but"
21-03-2018T18:04:59,Bgrmystr2,"when you get suggestions that are like ""what happened when X?"" as for a lore / history sketch"
21-03-2018T18:05:10,Bgrmystr2,you can probably figure those are most likely to be canonical
21-03-2018T18:05:16,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Sure yeah. Nat and Keith hanging out, flirting? Totally canon. Keith getting seduced by Clovis? Not canon"
21-03-2018T18:05:21,Bgrmystr2,the rest are obviously just for fun
21-03-2018T18:05:48,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"aye, and we do have lots of fun with these, don't we"
21-03-2018T18:06:10,WIPKING,"Who is your favorite character in the comic, mines natani"
21-03-2018T18:06:10,Bgrmystr2,most of the nat and keith ones are probably not canon as well
21-03-2018T18:06:13,UnknownEnd,Nani?
21-03-2018T18:06:14,Bgrmystr2,"in-character, though"
21-03-2018T18:06:28,Bgrmystr2,Don't have one WIP
21-03-2018T18:07:01,ItsActuallyKopyKat,My favorite character is Raine I think. She's just so hopelessly optimistic and naive it's adorable
21-03-2018T18:07:32,UnknownEnd,Nani?
21-03-2018T18:07:37,Bgrmystr2,I don't think she's naive as you think lol
21-03-2018T18:08:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Well, she definitely is a little. Definitely a hopeless optimist, though"
21-03-2018T18:08:39,Bgrmystr2,nothing wrong with optimism
21-03-2018T18:08:43,Bgrmystr2,why is it hopeless?
21-03-2018T18:10:07,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I mean, in a rhetorical sense. She always sees the best in people, even people who were previously her enemies. She found a way to compromise with Red and Sythe to keep Zen alive after they captured him; she used their supplies to help tend Zen's burn;"
21-03-2018T18:10:29,ItsActuallyKopyKat,she wants Red and Sythe to just get along and always plays the impartial third party when they argue
21-03-2018T18:10:46,UnknownEnd,is still Petting his cat
21-03-2018T18:10:55,Bgrmystr2,"and it works, doesn't it?"
21-03-2018T18:11:00,Bgrmystr2,that's not hopeless
21-03-2018T18:11:10,Bgrmystr2,it'd only be hopeless if it didn't work
21-03-2018T18:11:50,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"But that's what I mean, that's why she's my favorite character. She gets into these situations that seem impossible to solve, and she just makes it work"
21-03-2018T18:13:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"When I said that she's a hopeless optimist, I meant that in the theatrical sense, not that she's literally hopeless."
21-03-2018T18:15:55,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: Guess I just wouldn't have used that word than
21-03-2018T18:15:57,Bgrmystr2,then*
21-03-2018T18:16:15,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Eh, oh well. I'll try to explain better next time"
21-03-2018T18:16:25,WIPKING,How many people are usally in a stream
21-03-2018T18:16:58,Bgrmystr2,"anywhere from 90 to 130ish in the chat, though a majority don't speak"
21-03-2018T18:17:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Sunday, we had about 200 I think. Not everyone chats though, some just watch"
21-03-2018T18:17:12,Bgrmystr2,"200 watching, not in the chat"
21-03-2018T18:17:25,Bgrmystr2,and it passed 220
21-03-2018T18:17:27,Bgrmystr2,almost 230
21-03-2018T18:17:31,Bgrmystr2,but that's fairly common
21-03-2018T18:17:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"That's...that's what I said, right?"
21-03-2018T18:17:37,WIPKING,Ok that a least more then i thot
21-03-2018T18:17:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah but that's not what he meant xD
21-03-2018T18:18:08,Bgrmystr2,cuz ppl watching but not being in the chat have no effect on being in the chat
21-03-2018T18:18:21,Bgrmystr2,so they may as well not be there
21-03-2018T18:18:53,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"They can still go to the polls, though"
21-03-2018T18:19:02,ItsActuallyKopyKat,And vote on the sketches
21-03-2018T18:19:05,Bgrmystr2,they can
21-03-2018T18:19:19,Bgrmystr2,"but if they do, it's not obvious"
21-03-2018T18:19:32,Bgrmystr2,because the polls don't usually have more people voting than there are people actively in the chat
21-03-2018T18:19:42,WIPKING,I love how he has more than 300000 followers and only 22 subscribe
21-03-2018T18:19:54,Bgrmystr2,subscriptions cost money
21-03-2018T18:20:04,Bgrmystr2,most people who would pay him money do so on Patreon
21-03-2018T18:20:17,WIPKING,Oops 5000 300000 is his likes
21-03-2018T18:20:24,Bgrmystr2,the only benefits of paying money here are getting the chat icons
21-03-2018T18:20:35,WIPKING,Ya
21-03-2018T18:20:48,Bgrmystr2,"and no it's not his likes, it's his views"
21-03-2018T18:20:53,WIPKING,does my avatar look different to you cuz when I change it I can't see it
21-03-2018T18:20:55,Bgrmystr2,likes is youtube
21-03-2018T18:21:07,WIPKING,Views
21-03-2018T18:21:11,Bgrmystr2,that's client-based. it won't change unless I refresh my browser cache
21-03-2018T18:21:20,Bgrmystr2,it'd be the same thing with you
21-03-2018T18:21:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"If you change it, you need to clear your cache. control + F5 should do the trick if you're running Windows"
21-03-2018T18:21:39,WIPKING,You on pc or mobile
21-03-2018T18:21:48,Bgrmystr2,"I'm on the pc, as would be superior"
21-03-2018T18:21:55,Bgrmystr2,:v
21-03-2018T18:21:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,PC master race!
21-03-2018T18:22:09,Bgrmystr2,"Kat, it could be shift F5 as well"
21-03-2018T18:22:13,WIPKING,Alright i dont have a pc but i have 2007 mac up in the attic brb
21-03-2018T18:22:25,Bgrmystr2,"it's not based on OS, it's based on browsers"
21-03-2018T18:22:39,WIPKING,I have android
21-03-2018T18:22:46,Bgrmystr2,most mobile phones don't have a way to clear the cache as far as I know
21-03-2018T18:22:52,Bgrmystr2,"or if they do, I don't know of it"
21-03-2018T18:22:55,WIPKING,Hold on the mobile app
21-03-2018T18:23:15,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"For the mobile app, closing and reopening the app should do the trick"
21-03-2018T18:23:17,Bgrmystr2,so you may need to wait till picarto servers clear their cache instead
21-03-2018T18:23:27,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^ ^
21-03-2018T18:23:31,Bgrmystr2,you can hope
21-03-2018T18:23:39,Bgrmystr2,there was someone on the previous stream that tried that
21-03-2018T18:23:42,Bgrmystr2,and it didn't do anything
21-03-2018T18:23:47,WIPKING,Did it work
21-03-2018T18:23:54,Bgrmystr2,"it'd only work for you, not for us"
21-03-2018T18:23:58,WIPKING,Crap can see on the app
21-03-2018T18:23:58,Bgrmystr2,"Like I said, it's client-sided"
21-03-2018T18:25:28,WIPKING,Time for the old apple mac
21-03-2018T18:26:52,WIPKING,ha it works
21-03-2018T18:27:01,WIPKING,cool
21-03-2018T18:27:04,WIPKING,its slow tho
21-03-2018T18:27:20,Bgrmystr2,"remember that even if you refresh the cache on the mac, it won't refresh the cache for anyone else"
21-03-2018T18:27:22,Bgrmystr2,even your phone
21-03-2018T18:27:43,WIPKING,wait so what do you see
21-03-2018T18:27:55,Bgrmystr2,It's still a red thing
21-03-2018T18:27:59,Bgrmystr2,hard to tell lol
21-03-2018T18:28:08,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Well, I haven't cleared my own cache, but it's the same as it was when you joined"
21-03-2018T18:28:19,WIPKING,oh so how do you see the new one
21-03-2018T18:28:43,Bgrmystr2,we'd have to clear our caches for us to see it. Literally every single person who comes here would need to do it
21-03-2018T18:28:52,WIPKING,wow
21-03-2018T18:28:54,Bgrmystr2,because it's client-sided. It's individual.
21-03-2018T18:29:07,Bgrmystr2,"Eventually, the servers for Picarto will update"
21-03-2018T18:29:14,WIPKING,K
21-03-2018T18:29:22,Bgrmystr2,and they will naturally override the cache that everyone has
21-03-2018T18:29:30,Bgrmystr2,"so when the picarto servers update, everyone will see the new one"
21-03-2018T18:29:37,Bgrmystr2,whether or not we clear our cache or not
21-03-2018T18:29:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,Seems the people who gave us Odinsphere and Dragon's Crown are making a mecha game.

21-03-2018T18:30:02,Bgrmystr2,I see I've had a visit from the department of redundancy :c
21-03-2018T18:30:03,WIPKING,Im not a very good geek when it comes to websites but gaming is better

21-03-2018T18:58:55,Bgrmystr2,about an hour early
21-03-2018T18:59:16,Bigboi182,"Yes, but STILL!"
21-03-2018T18:59:29,Bigboi182,I'm just waiting for it...
21-03-2018T18:59:30,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Still ready, Freddy?"

21-03-2018T19:01:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Well. Tom's going to be doing 'it,' we're just watching him draw. And voicing our opinions"
21-03-2018T19:03:22,WIPKING,1 hour left
21-03-2018T19:03:36,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"57 minutes, actually. But who's counting"
21-03-2018T19:03:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Be back in an hour or so
21-03-2018T19:06:29,Bgrmystr2,xD Sounds like you are.
21-03-2018T19:08:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Of course, Tom never listens to our opinions.  ;P"

21-03-2018T19:10:41,Glavous,I went on yesterday and I thought I missed it lol
21-03-2018T19:11:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,I thought the same thing so don't worry about it.
21-03-2018T19:11:47,Bgrmystr2,"That's not possible, Glavous. We told you like 4 times that the stream was postponed till today at the same time."
21-03-2018T19:12:07,Glavous,so how's everyone doing?
21-03-2018T19:12:28,Glavous,yeah that's true
21-03-2018T19:12:37,Glavous,;p
21-03-2018T19:13:19,Bgrmystr2,"funny enough, you were not the only one who thought you missed the stream even after being told it was postponed till the day after"
21-03-2018T19:13:40,Bgrmystr2,someone came in earlier today talkin about the lack of comic update xD
21-03-2018T19:14:21,Bgrmystr2,guessing they didn't connect the stream to the comic
21-03-2018T19:15:29,Glavous,well this laptop is working again so I'm pretty happy.
21-03-2018T19:19:51,Glavous,hmm it got very quiet.
21-03-2018T19:21:24,Bgrmystr2,impossible

21-03-2018T19:23:36,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: okay
21-03-2018T19:26:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Oh snap.  I just remembered that I won't be able to see all of the stream.  Almost forgot the library is only open till 9 PM.  Well, I can catch some of the stream tonight on my iphone."
21-03-2018T19:38:41,Bigboi182,22 minutes

21-03-2018T19:47:48,Zakuru,listening to wonderful music
21-03-2018T19:47:57,Bigboi182,OK.
21-03-2018T19:49:31,Bigboi182,"Just a quick question: I'm about to make episode 3 for my comic 'Roomies' (I still can't think of a better name). Should it be called 'Sky Baby', 'Truth or Lies', or 'Vanishing Act'?"
21-03-2018T19:49:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sky baby
21-03-2018T19:50:35,Bigboi182,OK then. I have a really funny idea for it anyway...
21-03-2018T19:50:56,WIPKING,"O know this is very mean, but tom is so slow it takes him 2 years two make a chapter for this comic"
21-03-2018T19:51:33,Bigboi182,Plot progression is REALLY HARD y'know. No offense.
21-03-2018T19:52:51,Glavous,okay I'm back
21-03-2018T19:55:38,WIPKING,5 mins

21-03-2018T19:56:12,WIPKING,Wh3n
21-03-2018T19:56:15,WIPKING,When
21-03-2018T19:56:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,13 minutes ago
21-03-2018T19:56:33,WIPKING,So it starts at 8 pm
21-03-2018T19:56:40,WIPKING,Well for me
21-03-2018T19:56:46,Glavous,10:00pm
21-03-2018T19:56:48,WIPKING,Montain time
21-03-2018T19:56:52,Glavous,darnit
21-03-2018T19:56:53,WIPKING,"8p,"
21-03-2018T19:56:59,WIPKING,Pm
21-03-2018T19:57:06,Vatruvius,Ah..man...:ptv-sad:
21-03-2018T19:57:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"1900. Pacific Standard, here."
21-03-2018T19:57:16,Glavous,well 10:00 for me
21-03-2018T19:57:34,WIPKING,But is 9 where you are right
21-03-2018T19:57:44,Bgrmystr2,"you don't use Daylight savings, Kopy? :o"
21-03-2018T19:57:56,Vatruvius,"See you guys in an our, I will just be sitting here trying to get 1000+ mods to work on SSE+SKSE64..."
21-03-2018T19:58:00,Vatruvius,hour*
21-03-2018T19:58:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I do... 1900 = 7 Pm.
21-03-2018T19:58:25,ItsActuallyKopyKat,It'll be seven here when the stream starts
21-03-2018T19:58:31,Vatruvius,^
21-03-2018T19:58:43,Bgrmystr2,then it's not standard time
21-03-2018T19:58:45,Bgrmystr2,it's daylight time
21-03-2018T19:58:56,Bgrmystr2,Standard is for non-daylight savings
21-03-2018T19:59:11,WIPKING,Jesus its starts at 10 pm eastern standard time
21-03-2018T19:59:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
21-03-2018T19:59:23,Bgrmystr2,"xD no it doesn't, cuz we're on EDT right now"
21-03-2018T19:59:26,Bgrmystr2,not EST
21-03-2018T19:59:30,Glavous,it's probably going to be 2:00 am when it ends for me
21-03-2018T19:59:35,WIPKING,So it starts at 8 for mountian time
21-03-2018T19:59:43,Glavous,;(
21-03-2018T19:59:46,Bgrmystr2,"jeez daylight savings, so difficult"
21-03-2018T19:59:52,WIPKING,I know
21-03-2018T19:59:55,Vatruvius,"You guys are over thinking this, it starts in 1 hour!"
21-03-2018T20:00:05,WIPKING,😂
21-03-2018T20:00:09,Bgrmystr2,indeed Vatru
21-03-2018T20:00:13,WIPKING,We are overthinking it
21-03-2018T20:00:15,Glavous,yeah
21-03-2018T20:00:29,Glavous,way too much
21-03-2018T20:00:36,Bgrmystr2,"I think it's a lot of people underthinking it, but yknow"
21-03-2018T20:00:38,Vatruvius,How much do you guys want to bet that my first attempt will have all my mods work?
21-03-2018T20:00:41,Bgrmystr2,"time zones are hard, yo :V"
21-03-2018T20:00:53,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Hmmm Bgr, I think you're wrong. It is currently 6:00 Pm, PST. In one hour, it will be 7:00 PST. PST is the time zone for the western US, it doesn't have anything to do with daylight savings."
21-03-2018T20:01:10,Bgrmystr2,Kat. I'm not wrong. Daylight Savings already started
21-03-2018T20:01:13,Bgrmystr2,It's PDT
21-03-2018T20:01:14,Bgrmystr2,not PST
21-03-2018T20:01:37,Bgrmystr2,Look it up
21-03-2018T20:01:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,keep your science out of my pst
21-03-2018T20:01:54,Bgrmystr2,PST is only when using Standard time
21-03-2018T20:02:03,Vatruvius,How about we just vote for daylight savings to no longer be a thing? :ptv-wondering:
21-03-2018T20:02:21,Bgrmystr2,"because it saves an hour of daylight for a lot of the year, Vatru"
21-03-2018T20:02:25,Glavous,time to make something awful in blender I guess ;p
21-03-2018T20:02:36,Bgrmystr2,and allows for less vehicle accidents and such during those days
21-03-2018T20:02:44,Vatruvius,"Give my one, unified time damnit! :ptv-angry:"
21-03-2018T20:02:55,Bgrmystr2,"Tell the earth to not be tilted, then"
21-03-2018T20:02:57,WIPKING,Man i wish i waa older to inderatand this stuff
21-03-2018T20:03:02,WIPKING,Was
21-03-2018T20:03:06,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"That would work, Vat, if the Earth was flat."
21-03-2018T20:03:14,WIPKING,No stop
21-03-2018T20:03:14,Bgrmystr2,"no it wouldn't, Kopy XD"
21-03-2018T20:03:27,WIPKING,The earth is round
21-03-2018T20:03:28,Bgrmystr2,that would be terrible
21-03-2018T20:03:28,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Yes it would... the sun would rise and set for the entire earth at the same time
21-03-2018T20:03:47,Bgrmystr2,no it wouldn't. cuz the other side would have no light ever.
21-03-2018T20:03:52,Bgrmystr2,:u
21-03-2018T20:03:54,Bgrmystr2,RIP them
21-03-2018T20:03:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"but you are right about the PDT/PST thing, I just read the goolge search a bit too fast"
21-03-2018T20:04:06,Vatruvius,"Okay, daylight savings is a think we do to our time, the tilt of the earth has nothing to do with daylight savings. Time is still the same, we just decide to change the clocks so the sun coincides with work."
21-03-2018T20:04:09,Glavous,the earth is a sphere
21-03-2018T20:04:20,WIPKING,I wish i was older so i was smarter so understand you guys
21-03-2018T20:04:31,Vatruvius,lol
21-03-2018T20:04:33,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I know that the Earth is a sphere. I said that there would only need to be one time zone, if the earth was flat."
21-03-2018T20:04:33,Bgrmystr2,"the tilt of the earth has everything to do with it, cuz that's how the hours get longer and shorter, Vatru"
21-03-2018T20:04:45,Ordithus,"I use a sun dial, screw your time zones.  The only problem is when it's cloudy or the sun goes down... :P"
21-03-2018T20:04:55,Vatruvius,"An hour is an hour Bgr, they don't get longer or shorter :P"
21-03-2018T20:05:11,Bgrmystr2,tell that to Alaska :V
21-03-2018T20:05:27,WIPKING,XD
21-03-2018T20:05:35,Bgrmystr2,the hours of the day* Not the hours themselves
21-03-2018T20:05:38,Vatruvius,The sun is simply up for longer in Alaska during summer.
21-03-2018T20:06:00,Bgrmystr2,because the tilt of the earth
21-03-2018T20:06:02,WIPKING,we need to stop this time is time ok it will never stop
21-03-2018T20:06:04,Bgrmystr2,:V
21-03-2018T20:06:08,Bgrmystr2,time will stop
21-03-2018T20:06:11,Bgrmystr2,eventually
21-03-2018T20:06:16,Bgrmystr2,and we will all be ded.
21-03-2018T20:06:23,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades:

21-03-2018T20:06:35,WIPKING,Than dogs will take ober
21-03-2018T20:06:36,Vatruvius,"You are making this too confusing Bgr, I aced my geology class...I know this shit. I think we are misunderstanding eachother through this chat chaos."
21-03-2018T20:06:47,WIPKING,Over
21-03-2018T20:06:53,Bgrmystr2,it's not confusing XD

21-03-2018T20:08:26,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-03-2018T20:08:32,Bgrmystr2,"Things, WIP. Things."
21-03-2018T20:08:36,Vatruvius,The most important question...you will never be able to answer it.

21-03-2018T20:09:54,Vatruvius,Yeah...screw it! It is not helpful anyway!

21-03-2018T20:27:44,TorqueEmUp,"meh, consoles are more my thing"
21-03-2018T20:27:49,Vatruvius,I stopped getting 360s when I was tired of having to pay money to play online. I already do that for AT&T! :ptv-angry:
21-03-2018T20:27:51,TorqueEmUp,PC are alright
21-03-2018T20:28:03,Glavous,same
21-03-2018T20:28:15,WIPKING,Oh also i have a super amazing

21-03-2018T20:28:42,Glavous,lol
21-03-2018T20:28:45,TomFurson,PC
21-03-2018T20:28:52,WIPKING,ITS A WII
21-03-2018T20:28:58,TorqueEmUp,"I only prefer PC if I want to mod games, which isn't often"
21-03-2018T20:29:03,WIPKING,THAY SUCK LOL
21-03-2018T20:29:30,TomFurson,At least on PC you don't need to pay for Xbox Live
21-03-2018T20:29:33,TorqueEmUp,Just find it easier to grab a controller and kick back on a couch.
21-03-2018T20:29:40,Bgrmystr2,@Vatruvius Tom is not the one that uploads the streams to youtube. That's Iliar.
21-03-2018T20:29:41,Vatruvius,"PC is better, you can multitask everything on them, have a hard time distinguishing between reality and a game, and have epic game sales on steam."
21-03-2018T20:29:45,Glavous,no but I don't like them for gaming
21-03-2018T20:30:10,Vatruvius,Ohh...interesting @Bgrmystr2
21-03-2018T20:30:37,Glavous,wow my message got delayed
21-03-2018T20:30:48,Vatruvius,seemed out of place I must say
21-03-2018T20:30:58,Bgrmystr2,"pcs have support for the same gamepads consoles do, and plenty more than that"
21-03-2018T20:31:08,Bgrmystr2,"consoles have games pcs don't have, sure, but pcs do as well"
21-03-2018T20:31:15,Bgrmystr2,and they outnumber consoles combined
21-03-2018T20:31:46,TorqueEmUp,but only a small fraction of PCs are capable of playing games at a decent capacity
21-03-2018T20:31:54,Bgrmystr2,that's not true
21-03-2018T20:32:13,Bgrmystr2,that's the great thing about pcs. they're fully customizable.
21-03-2018T20:32:38,Bgrmystr2,"laptops are not made for gaming, thus they're not easy to exchange hardware"
21-03-2018T20:32:39,TorqueEmUp,"Unless they have dedicated graphics cards, most PCs out there can't play games on anything more than low settings"
21-03-2018T20:32:51,Bgrmystr2,but desktops stand out as the kings
21-03-2018T20:33:08,Bgrmystr2,and any computer worth it's salt has a dedicated graphics card
21-03-2018T20:33:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^
21-03-2018T20:33:17,Vatruvius,I would never buy a laptop for school to do gaming. That is a no brainier not going to work.
21-03-2018T20:33:23,TorqueEmUp,Can't buy my games physically on PC. Big negative right there for me.
21-03-2018T20:33:28,Glavous,try playing anything on a laptop with 2 GB ram
21-03-2018T20:33:49,Bgrmystr2,"why not Torque? Go to store, buy game, put game in CD tray"
21-03-2018T20:33:51,Vatruvius,"Also, I can upgrade parts individual instead of having to fork over another $600+ to get something better."
21-03-2018T20:33:52,TorqueEmUp,very few PC games get physical releases anymore.
21-03-2018T20:34:13,TorqueEmUp,"and if they do, they are on a single DVD that requires a massive download for the rest."
21-03-2018T20:34:23,Bgrmystr2,"and if anything, that's a plus. Most games don't even require disks now. You don't need to worry about scratching the disk"
21-03-2018T20:34:37,Vatruvius,"PC games are getting too big for CDs these days, just does not make sense anymore"
21-03-2018T20:34:49,TheFDdriver,what are we talking about?
21-03-2018T20:34:55,Bgrmystr2,"generally, you just download the game directly from the site who hosts it."
21-03-2018T20:35:00,Bgrmystr2,I don't even have a CD drive on my pc
21-03-2018T20:35:04,Bgrmystr2,don't need one
21-03-2018T20:35:20,Bgrmystr2,haven't needed one since like 2006 or so
21-03-2018T20:35:40,TheFDdriver,game card?
21-03-2018T20:35:46,Bgrmystr2,"everything I do, all games I play, everything is done through flash drives or virtual CD drive."
21-03-2018T20:35:59,Bgrmystr2,"I don't need a physical disk ever, nor do I need to worry about losing those disks"
21-03-2018T20:36:01,Bgrmystr2,"or scratching them,"
21-03-2018T20:36:31,TorqueEmUp,That's honestly your fault if you are that careless with them. :P
21-03-2018T20:36:33,TheFDdriver,"now that you said that Bgr, next games will probably be on flash drives"
21-03-2018T20:36:41,Bgrmystr2,"not really, Torque."
21-03-2018T20:36:54,Bgrmystr2,You'd be surprised what can happen to disks when you're not looking
21-03-2018T20:36:57,Bgrmystr2,and what can scratch them
21-03-2018T20:37:10,Bgrmystr2,"games already exist on flash drives, FD"
21-03-2018T20:37:20,TorqueEmUp,"Basically all you PC lot are pretentious assholes who constantly have to tell people ""My way is better"""
21-03-2018T20:37:32,TheFDdriver,lol
21-03-2018T20:37:35,TheFDdriver,true
21-03-2018T20:37:43,Bgrmystr2,"xD Torque, that's not even remotely happening"
21-03-2018T20:37:46,Vatruvius,It is called the PC Master Race for a reason!
21-03-2018T20:38:06,Vatruvius,"But I am with Bgr here, PCs are better. That is a fact."
21-03-2018T20:38:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,CTD?
21-03-2018T20:38:48,Bgrmystr2,"PCs are more powerful and more versitile, but also have drawbacks of being more complex and being more difficult to keep running."
21-03-2018T20:38:49,TheFDdriver,my N64 is better than your PC
21-03-2018T20:38:54,TheFDdriver,thats a fact
21-03-2018T20:38:56,TorqueEmUp,"Console for my gaming, and a cheap laptop for everything else. Works perfectly fine for me."
21-03-2018T20:40:06,Bgrmystr2,"Torque, sometime down the line when you get a proper desktop, you probably won't think the same way you do now."
21-03-2018T20:40:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lol FD
21-03-2018T20:40:18,Bgrmystr2,there's plusses and minuses to everything
21-03-2018T20:40:33,TorqueEmUp,I actually do for the rare time there is a game I want to play that's only on PC.
21-03-2018T20:40:47,TorqueEmUp,I have a Desktop with a GTX1070
21-03-2018T20:40:49,TheFDdriver,what is it?
21-03-2018T20:41:24,Vatruvius,The only game I am sad about not being on PC is Last of US
21-03-2018T20:41:30,TorqueEmUp,but I prefer to game on my X and PS4 Pro for a majority of stuff.
21-03-2018T20:41:50,Bgrmystr2,Just give it time lol
21-03-2018T20:41:52,TorqueEmUp,"Just less hassel, more power efficient."
21-03-2018T20:42:18,TheFDdriver,i dont have powet
21-03-2018T20:42:27,TheFDdriver,*power*
21-03-2018T20:42:40,Bgrmystr2,none of us have power lol
21-03-2018T20:42:50,TheFDdriver,i mean
21-03-2018T20:43:04,TheFDdriver,i have an S6 edge and a 360
21-03-2018T20:43:09,Zakuru,and im back! boy. time sure flies when your drawing owo;
21-03-2018T20:43:59,TheFDdriver,wb
21-03-2018T20:44:01,TorqueEmUp,"When it gets down to it. Yes, PCs are great if you want the game to look it's best."
21-03-2018T20:44:10,TorqueEmUp,But gaming is so much more to me then that.
21-03-2018T20:44:56,Bgrmystr2,It is to me as well
21-03-2018T20:45:05,Vatruvius,"PC is not just about making games look better, everything you can do on console you can do on pc and then some."
21-03-2018T20:45:13,Bgrmystr2,yeh Vatru
21-03-2018T20:45:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like crash to desktop
21-03-2018T20:45:25,Bgrmystr2,xD
21-03-2018T20:45:34,TorqueEmUp,driver issues
21-03-2018T20:45:35,Bgrmystr2,you can do that on console as well
21-03-2018T20:45:40,Vatruvius,I have more connections playing on pc then I ever did on console plus my pc doubles as my school pc/work pc
21-03-2018T20:45:43,TorqueEmUp,optimisation issues
21-03-2018T20:45:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and editing files so you can actually beat the game
21-03-2018T20:46:08,Vatruvius,Well...a minority does that.
21-03-2018T20:46:24,TorqueEmUp,"I always like how people use the excuse ""I can do more then play games on it."""
21-03-2018T20:46:27,Bgrmystr2,"cuz one isn't good enough to beat the game without doing so, Marv? :P"
21-03-2018T20:46:32,Vatruvius,"But to make it clear, console games are programmed on PCs"
21-03-2018T20:46:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I should not have to edit files just to play the last mission of crisis 1
21-03-2018T20:46:43,Bgrmystr2,"it's not an excuse, Torque. Work is something everyone has to do"
21-03-2018T20:47:05,WIPKING,I have school
21-03-2018T20:47:06,Bgrmystr2,Even tom has games on his computer that he uses to draw Twokinds with.
21-03-2018T20:47:10,Vatruvius,"It saves money, my gaming rig being the same thing I do work on makes sense."
21-03-2018T20:47:16,TorqueEmUp,"And a more power efficent laptop can't do the same ""work""?"
21-03-2018T20:47:34,TorqueEmUp,"unless you are encoding video, or doing some heavy 3D work, a laptop is sufficent."
21-03-2018T20:47:39,Bgrmystr2,Show me a laptop that can render the same resolution that tom uses.
21-03-2018T20:47:40,Bgrmystr2,xD
21-03-2018T20:47:53,Bgrmystr2,Or Fluff
21-03-2018T20:47:55,Bgrmystr2,or Sage
21-03-2018T20:47:58,Bgrmystr2,or any of them
21-03-2018T20:48:01,TorqueEmUp,Artists are a minority
21-03-2018T20:48:05,Vatruvius,The power efficiency you are talking about is negligible. A power efficient laptop means the batter last longer at a cost.
21-03-2018T20:48:08,TheFDdriver,N64

21-03-2018T20:48:43,Bgrmystr2,it's not even remotely the same as it used to be
21-03-2018T20:48:46,TheFDdriver,XBOX is a computer
21-03-2018T20:48:53,WIPKING,Ya xbox

21-03-2018T20:49:59,TorqueEmUp,Seriously though. They have their pros and cons. PCs nor consoles are the best thing
21-03-2018T20:50:00,TomFurson,art*
21-03-2018T20:50:04,TorqueEmUp,it's all subjective

21-03-2018T20:51:27,WIPKING,I only now jurrasic park
21-03-2018T20:51:43,Bgrmystr2,"The difference is, Torque, the opposite is true as well"
21-03-2018T20:51:52,Bgrmystr2,contrary to popular belief
21-03-2018T20:51:58,WIPKING,Anyone know vanossgaming
21-03-2018T20:52:10,Bigboi182,"I agree, Torque."
21-03-2018T20:52:24,Vatruvius,Vanoss fan over here!
21-03-2018T20:52:25,TorqueEmUp,"I dunno, I see more people shouting PC Master Race"
21-03-2018T20:52:28,WIPKING,Badoob badoob banana bus
21-03-2018T20:52:36,TorqueEmUp,"Console games are just like ""Ehh I prefer consoles"""
21-03-2018T20:52:37,Vatruvius,PC Master Race!
21-03-2018T20:52:46,Bigboi182,Maybe it's because I've rocked console all my life...
21-03-2018T20:52:49,TorqueEmUp,gamers*
21-03-2018T20:52:52,Bgrmystr2,"Simplicity, Torque."
21-03-2018T20:52:59,Bigboi182,It just works.
21-03-2018T20:53:01,Bgrmystr2,Simplicity is the key there.
21-03-2018T20:53:16,WIPKING,Heh i has a bad youtube channel
21-03-2018T20:53:19,Bgrmystr2,and also no. XD the console wars are real.
21-03-2018T20:53:31,WIPKING,Its really embarrasing
21-03-2018T20:53:40,Bigboi182,"Plus, I think PC gaming is more expensive than console in the long run..."
21-03-2018T20:53:41,TorqueEmUp,"I'ves got a PS4 Pro, Xbox One X, and a PC with a GTX1070"
21-03-2018T20:53:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,No stream tonight?
21-03-2018T20:53:50,Bigboi182,7 mins
21-03-2018T20:53:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wait 7 minutes palm
21-03-2018T20:53:55,Bgrmystr2,"a few mins, palm"
21-03-2018T20:53:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay.
21-03-2018T20:54:09,Bigboi182,@WIPKING it can't be that bad...
21-03-2018T20:54:31,Vatruvius,"PC is more expensive, but I feel it is worth it. You add up the different consoles you buy as new ones come out plus remaster games plus the stupid online fee...it adds up. That is why it is so profitable."
21-03-2018T20:54:36,TorqueEmUp,I just prefer having the physical games over a digital download.
21-03-2018T20:54:44,WIPKING,H torque I have a PS1 PS2 PS3 Wii original Xbox a Xbox 360 and Xbox One and Xbox One X and a PC Plus a tablet and many many more
21-03-2018T20:54:45,Bigboi182,Same.
21-03-2018T20:54:49,WIPKING,Get on my level
21-03-2018T20:54:50,TorqueEmUp,and I know I am in the minority with that.
21-03-2018T20:55:12,Bigboi182,"OK WIP, That is a biiiit overkill..."
21-03-2018T20:55:13,TorqueEmUp,Oh i've got more than just those 3. I just don't want to post a huge list
21-03-2018T20:55:21,Bgrmystr2,"Torque, I prefer physical games over digital ones too. But I can't deny physical games have serious limitations."
21-03-2018T20:55:22,Vatruvius,All my PC games are in a physical form...the exact same as on those CDs. Let me just pull out my hard drive.
21-03-2018T20:55:45,Bigboi182,"Then again, I have two of everything from the sixth genration except an Xbox or Dreamcast..."
21-03-2018T20:55:54,Bigboi182,*generation
21-03-2018T20:55:58,WIPKING,Heh and over 1000 hames
21-03-2018T20:56:00,WIPKING,Games
21-03-2018T20:56:06,Bigboi182,Wow
21-03-2018T20:56:16,TorqueEmUp,"It's like people who prefer vinyl, to FLAC downloads."
21-03-2018T20:56:25,Bigboi182,True. So true
21-03-2018T20:56:25,TorqueEmUp,Consoles and physical games is part of the experience.
21-03-2018T20:56:29,Ordithus,I wonder if there are any games on punch card? :ptv-wondering:
21-03-2018T20:56:34,WIPKING,Im 13 and habe no clue what tjose are
21-03-2018T20:56:38,WIPKING,Tjose*
21-03-2018T20:56:39,Bigboi182,Not sure
21-03-2018T20:56:47,Bgrmystr2,"That's not exactly the same comparison, Torque, but.. I guess it's close enough"
21-03-2018T20:56:48,Bigboi182,*those*
21-03-2018T20:57:01,WIPKING,Those
21-03-2018T20:57:06,WIPKING,My fingers are big
21-03-2018T20:57:15,Bgrmystr2,and the newer consoles are switching more and more to downloadable games
21-03-2018T20:57:18,Bigboi182,"like, REALLY close Torque..."
21-03-2018T20:57:18,Vatruvius,A game on a punch card would be the worst game ever.
21-03-2018T20:57:20,Bgrmystr2,where the game doesn't come on the disk
21-03-2018T20:57:26,WIPKING,Its why ive been using the mic
21-03-2018T20:57:28,Bigboi182,true

21-03-2018T20:58:01,Ordithus,"It could be amazing, Vat.  Just have to load it for three hours, and it takes up a cabinet.  But it could be worth it."

21-03-2018T20:58:35,Bigboi182,LOL the trademark XD
21-03-2018T20:58:39,Vatruvius,The cabinet would fall due to the weight of the punch card.

21-03-2018T21:01:05,TorqueEmUp,"One plus about consoles. I don't have to deal with having to using multiple different services for games. Steam, Uplay, Origin, or just their own launchers."

21-03-2018T21:09:11,Twokinds,I don't want to rush it out just for the sake of the stream.
21-03-2018T21:09:13,MoonDance,"That's all understandable man. Take your time, I'm sure it wouldn't anyone for them to wait a few more days for a new page. You are an actual person after~"

21-03-2018T21:09:44,TheFDdriver,we know that drawing is hard
21-03-2018T21:09:49,WIPKING,Right see everyone in two weeks

21-03-2018T21:10:38,Bigboi182,I can understand his pain. I'm struggling with MY comic because the drawings don't come out the way I wan't them to.
21-03-2018T21:10:54,WIPKING,Tom are going too 2018 comic con?
21-03-2018T21:10:54,TomFurson,"Well have a good day or week, Tom"

21-03-2018T21:11:27,Bigboi182,"So, give yourself some time to relax, and if you need any help, we'll be here."
21-03-2018T21:11:55,WIPKING,Bye
21-03-2018T21:12:08,Bgrmystr2,I remember when Tom started that schedule..
21-03-2018T21:12:15,Bgrmystr2,the Wed stream for the comic page
21-03-2018T21:12:17,Bigboi182,See you WIPKING!
21-03-2018T21:12:46,unsteddyphoenix,It's always been a difficult one.
21-03-2018T21:13:14,unsteddyphoenix,I do remember certain people getting far too upset about it.
21-03-2018T21:13:19,Bigboi182,Yeah..
21-03-2018T21:13:39,Bigboi182,Seeing comic streams pop up on Mondays or Tuesdays...
21-03-2018T21:13:47,Bigboi182,Without any warning...
21-03-2018T21:14:05,Vatruvius,"I missed all of that, has the stream been canceled?"
21-03-2018T21:14:12,Bigboi182,"To be fair, that used to anger me too..."
21-03-2018T21:14:14,Ordithus,Maybe?
21-03-2018T21:14:21,Bigboi182,Yes Vat.
21-03-2018T21:14:23,Twokinds,Why?
21-03-2018T21:14:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, yeah why"
21-03-2018T21:14:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they more surprised me then anything
21-03-2018T21:14:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,...that is an odd thing to say...
21-03-2018T21:14:54,Ordithus,"Do answer, I think he'd like to know."
21-03-2018T21:15:05,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-03-2018T21:15:07,Bigboi182,"Missing the chance to see one of my favorite artists, why wouldn't that anger me?"
21-03-2018T21:15:24,Bgrmystr2,"well, it's not like you missed a chance though"
21-03-2018T21:15:27,Bgrmystr2,cuz it never happened
21-03-2018T21:15:33,unsteddyphoenix,"I can see it being annoying, but some people really did have like mini-tantrums"
21-03-2018T21:15:45,unsteddyphoenix,"You can always watch the replay, though."
21-03-2018T21:15:52,TomFurson,It is just a stream. Just wait
21-03-2018T21:15:52,WIPKING,Do be mean guys who knows what he does in hus spare time
21-03-2018T21:15:58,Bigboi182,"When I first stumbled upon your comic 6 months ago, I was HOOKED. Like, really interested."
21-03-2018T21:16:11,Bgrmystr2,"you and everyone else, big"
21-03-2018T21:16:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I can see if people are at school or work they would be ""well rip"" but I don't understand anger"
21-03-2018T21:16:22,Char89TheCharizard,"In my opinion, Tom's not ready to stream yet"
21-03-2018T21:16:25,unsteddyphoenix,Im here because im super uninterested
21-03-2018T21:16:30,madgamer7014,i think the stream schedule is fine
21-03-2018T21:16:31,unsteddyphoenix,Same Marv
21-03-2018T21:16:36,Ordithus,"firebird, lol"
21-03-2018T21:16:40,WIPKING,Hes not going to today
21-03-2018T21:16:41,Bgrmystr2,"are you sure it's your opinion, Char, cuz I'm fairly certain he actually said so"
21-03-2018T21:16:50,Bgrmystr2,xD
21-03-2018T21:16:56,unsteddyphoenix,"It's more a ""aw dangit"" instead of a ""REE HOW DARE HE"""
21-03-2018T21:16:56,Bigboi182,"Since then, I've always waited for his stream, hoping to learn from him"
21-03-2018T21:17:11,Bgrmystr2,rip learning
21-03-2018T21:17:17,Bigboi182,And hopefully become a better artist.
21-03-2018T21:17:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Again, the replays are there"
21-03-2018T21:17:22,Vatruvius,I am with you @unsteddyphoenix
21-03-2018T21:17:22,TorqueEmUp,"Schedules will always be super stressful, even moreso when you got fans looming over your shoulder."
21-03-2018T21:17:24,Bgrmystr2,"just gotta watch, you know, the other two streams"
21-03-2018T21:17:26,WIPKING,I was hoping to get on youtube
21-03-2018T21:17:28,Char89TheCharizard,"well right now, I'm watching one of the March Madness games on tv"
21-03-2018T21:17:31,Bgrmystr2,and the vods
21-03-2018T21:17:35,unsteddyphoenix,Good to go to sleep to

21-03-2018T21:18:06,WIPKING,Yeah
21-03-2018T21:18:16,Ordithus,"There are also tons more artists than just Tom, lot's of tutorials out there."
21-03-2018T21:18:25,Bigboi182,"Especially since I'm NOT a patron, and can't really find the money to voice my opinion."
21-03-2018T21:18:42,unsteddyphoenix,All Toms art is free
21-03-2018T21:18:44,Bigboi182,"True, but Tom is one of my favorites."
21-03-2018T21:18:48,WIPKING,well I got a picture of Tom trying to guess my age so
21-03-2018T21:19:06,Bgrmystr2,you sure you're not 70 something?
21-03-2018T21:19:12,WIPKING,13
21-03-2018T21:19:14,TorqueEmUp,"I support only 2 artists, and Tom is one of them."
21-03-2018T21:19:17,Bgrmystr2,aww man
21-03-2018T21:19:21,Bgrmystr2,I was close

21-03-2018T21:19:33,WIPKING,You were 57 off
21-03-2018T21:19:40,Ordithus,Rounding error
21-03-2018T21:19:40,Bgrmystr2,so close.....
21-03-2018T21:19:43,Bigboi182,I watch other artists and animatiors
21-03-2018T21:19:58,WIPKING,Nah Vanoss
21-03-2018T21:20:29,Bigboi182,"Piemations, AnimatedJames, Jaiden and TheOdd1sOut, but they can't beat Tom's style."
21-03-2018T21:20:48,WIPKING,He has 2003 style
21-03-2018T21:20:52,WIPKING,The best
21-03-2018T21:20:59,Bigboi182,"Come to think of it, why don't you have a Youtube channel?"
21-03-2018T21:21:05,WIPKING,Me
21-03-2018T21:21:20,Bigboi182,I mean Tom.
21-03-2018T21:21:27,Twokinds,I don't do animations
21-03-2018T21:21:27,WIPKING,Yaaa
21-03-2018T21:21:36,WIPKING,Not animations
21-03-2018T21:21:42,Twokinds,I'm not creative enough to make stuff like that
21-03-2018T21:21:42,WIPKING,Live streams
21-03-2018T21:21:55,Twokinds,Eh
21-03-2018T21:21:57,unsteddyphoenix,lol
21-03-2018T21:22:01,Twokinds,I'm fine here
21-03-2018T21:22:13,Bigboi182,"""Not creative enough"" You're joking, right?"
21-03-2018T21:22:14,WIPKING,People are taking your work and making thers tho
21-03-2018T21:22:28,WIPKING,They make audiobooks
21-03-2018T21:22:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Couldve just said ""dont have time"""
21-03-2018T21:22:31,WIPKING,Too
21-03-2018T21:22:42,Bigboi182,That's not what I'm trying to do.
21-03-2018T21:22:44,BluePhantom90,but If you were to say get a Million dollars Tom would you try your hand on animation?
21-03-2018T21:22:56,Bigboi182,I use his drawings for inspiration.
21-03-2018T21:23:16,WIPKING,Tom i but your $3 artbook but the amount said I was too young to read it so I have to wait until I'm 18
21-03-2018T21:23:17,Bigboi182,"Basically saying ""Start from the bottom, then get there."""
21-03-2018T21:23:24,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. he's already got a decent grasp of animating to start with, I just think he's just fine with drawing the comic as he does now."
21-03-2018T21:23:24,WIPKING,30$

21-03-2018T21:24:14,WIPKING,Why?
21-03-2018T21:24:17,Bigboi182,Seen that too
21-03-2018T21:24:18,TheFDdriver,wasted
21-03-2018T21:24:29,Ordithus,"It's a recurring theme, robit.  Also, hi, robit!"
21-03-2018T21:24:30,unsteddyphoenix,Yes but there's a lot of people who has no idea how animationworks
21-03-2018T21:24:30,WIPKING,Floras flat tho
21-03-2018T21:24:32,unsteddyphoenix,Not jsut one
21-03-2018T21:24:35,Bigboi182,"Yeah, but this is sliiightly different"
21-03-2018T21:24:40,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all
21-03-2018T21:24:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Daddy
21-03-2018T21:24:57,TheFDdriver,hello Dadro
21-03-2018T21:24:57,Dadrobit,"But, I thought you just animated things and it was animated??? /sarcasm"
21-03-2018T21:25:05,Bigboi182,"It's not about that ""animated series"" crapI threw in Sunday."
21-03-2018T21:25:24,Bigboi182,This is different.
21-03-2018T21:25:36,unsteddyphoenix,totes
21-03-2018T21:25:53,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly we got this :ctwokinds-FloDance: masterpiece and people still demand more tsk
21-03-2018T21:26:01,Twokinds,"If I had a million dollars, I probably still wouldn't. My love is comics."
21-03-2018T21:26:19,Bigboi182,I'm one of those people who like to imagine far beyond their skills.
21-03-2018T21:26:22,TheFDdriver,how do we know when comic stream is?
21-03-2018T21:26:35,Dadrobit,Fanbase has always been ravenous. Miss a stream? REEEEEEEEE! Make an April Fools Comic? REEEEEEEEE!.
21-03-2018T21:26:37,unsteddyphoenix,you dont thats the point
21-03-2018T21:26:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm just picturing Tom holding a pen shouting Comics Forever
21-03-2018T21:26:53,TomFurson,If I had a million dollars I would invest and pay off my college debt
21-03-2018T21:27:05,TorqueEmUp,I like Tom's April Fools day comics. :P
21-03-2018T21:27:18,TheFDdriver,never been
21-03-2018T21:27:20,Twokinds,"I would, however, update more often XD"
21-03-2018T21:27:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I just have the realistic expectation that Tom will never stop making comics as long as I live. None of this ""animation"" stuff."
21-03-2018T21:27:28,Bigboi182,"In my mind, I've already made 20+animations with a decent amount of subs on YT."
21-03-2018T21:27:28,Dadrobit,"Same, but some people really like their pixels."
21-03-2018T21:27:30,TomFurson,"I thought ""Red"" was becoming a wolf until the end"
21-03-2018T21:27:46,TheFDdriver,lol same
21-03-2018T21:27:57,unsteddyphoenix,Youd update more often with more money?
21-03-2018T21:28:04,unsteddyphoenix,Would think it'd be the opposite if anything
21-03-2018T21:28:06,Ordithus,"The real April Fools', is that he is.  It's the long con."
21-03-2018T21:28:10,TorqueEmUp,Sounds stressful
21-03-2018T21:28:12,Dadrobit,He runs off of money.
21-03-2018T21:28:14,Bigboi182,"Then I have to pull myself into reality and tell myself ""You're not there. yet."""
21-03-2018T21:28:31,Dadrobit,Like a quarter machine.
21-03-2018T21:28:35,Bigboi182,That's kind of why he has a patreon.
21-03-2018T21:28:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tom burns money to power the steam engine in his house
21-03-2018T21:28:37,TorqueEmUp,Don't we all run off of money
21-03-2018T21:28:42,TomFurson,@Ordithus I wonder how he will actually react
21-03-2018T21:28:43,Twokinds,"If I had a million dollars, I would hire someone to help bounce ideas off of, and an inker to speed things up a little."
21-03-2018T21:28:48,Twokinds,And put out three pages a week.
21-03-2018T21:28:53,Bigboi182,That's it?
21-03-2018T21:28:55,unsteddyphoenix,Ah fair enough
21-03-2018T21:29:01,TorqueEmUp,Only 3 pages? :P
21-03-2018T21:29:04,Dadrobit,"""That's it"""
21-03-2018T21:29:06,Twokinds,3 pages is realistic.
21-03-2018T21:29:07,Bigboi182,"No lie, that seems like a little."
21-03-2018T21:29:16,TomFurson,I'd do it if I had photoshop
21-03-2018T21:29:23,Bigboi182,"But it is realistic, for you at least."
21-03-2018T21:29:29,Vatruvius,"Hey @TorqueEmUp, that is a 300% increase"
21-03-2018T21:29:33,unsteddyphoenix,What is this banter
21-03-2018T21:29:37,TomFurson,But I am a cheep bastard
21-03-2018T21:29:38,TorqueEmUp,I was teasing
21-03-2018T21:29:45,TheFDdriver,"if i had one million dollars, I would fix my rx7"
21-03-2018T21:29:46,Vatruvius,I know :P
21-03-2018T21:30:13,Ordithus,"Most comics that are 3 ""pages"" a week are like ye olde newspaper panels, and add up to a long form page."
21-03-2018T21:30:26,Bigboi182,"If I had a million dollars, I'd probably pay off my college fund, buy a drawing tablet, and give the rest away."
21-03-2018T21:30:36,Ordithus,"So, if you compare TK to say, Freefall or Housepets, they're already kinda similar."
21-03-2018T21:30:43,TorqueEmUp,"My last delivery tonight was at a house, and they had an old SA/FB RX7 sitting in the driveway"
21-03-2018T21:31:02,Bigboi182,You should buy it off them.
21-03-2018T21:31:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,":musical_note:If I had a million dollars, Well I'd buy you a house:musical_note:"
21-03-2018T21:31:24,TheFDdriver,yes buy it off
21-03-2018T21:31:32,TomFurson,I would get a new drawing tablet too. Right now I am using a huion
21-03-2018T21:31:33,TorqueEmUp,"Other than the muffler falling off, it looked in really good shape for just sitting outside."
21-03-2018T21:31:35,Bigboi182,"Fix it, then drive it till the tires pop."
21-03-2018T21:31:40,Dadrobit,"Buy a house within my means, spend the rest on health insurance."
21-03-2018T21:31:56,Bigboi182,That's another idea.
21-03-2018T21:32:06,unsteddyphoenix,Could you live off the interest? :thinking:
21-03-2018T21:32:08,TheFDdriver,i would buy a house......a treehouse
21-03-2018T21:33:23,TorqueEmUp,"If I had the slightest inkling of how to repair a 13B rotary, I would try and buy it. lol"
21-03-2018T21:33:24,Bigboi182,"So Tom, what you're saying is, you're tired of disappointing people in terms of streams, and you just need a little more help to keep things running?"
21-03-2018T21:33:41,Bigboi182,"If so, that makes sense."
21-03-2018T21:33:46,Twokinds,Yeah
21-03-2018T21:33:51,TorqueEmUp,Japanese 4-bangers are more my speed
21-03-2018T21:33:55,Twokinds,Sometimes it's hard being the only one running everything.
21-03-2018T21:34:02,Twokinds,I feel like I'm always putting out fires.
21-03-2018T21:34:07,Bigboi182,"Whew, thought I was hilariously wronh"
21-03-2018T21:34:10,TomFurson,Sorry about that
21-03-2018T21:34:15,TorqueEmUp,Need to build more firestations
21-03-2018T21:34:32,unsteddyphoenix,Delegate to your cat
21-03-2018T21:34:48,Twokinds,I wish I could afford to take the pressure off a little.
21-03-2018T21:34:49,Bigboi182,"Like you're Smokey Bear, doing this for FAR TOO LONG."
21-03-2018T21:34:50,Vatruvius,Yeah...your cat should pull its weight! :P
21-03-2018T21:34:52,TomFurson,I would do the line art but I only have krita and SAI so...
21-03-2018T21:35:00,Twokinds,It's why I've been looking for side writers.
21-03-2018T21:35:11,Bigboi182,We're always here.
21-03-2018T21:35:17,WIPKING,Well i know im too yough but i would like too
21-03-2018T21:35:36,BluePhantom90,yeah I mean we are all fans. we are all always willing to help Tom
21-03-2018T21:35:40,Bigboi182,We've got plenty of writers and artists within the fanbase.
21-03-2018T21:35:44,TomFurson,I could use somthing to do in my down time. Being an art student and all'
21-03-2018T21:35:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"if you do find a side writer, make sure he's not biased about things like me"
21-03-2018T21:35:51,Bigboi182,Yeah.
21-03-2018T21:35:53,TorqueEmUp,"That's the problem really, is we a fans."
21-03-2018T21:36:02,TorqueEmUp,Having fans write something is usually a bad idea.

21-03-2018T21:36:07,unsteddyphoenix,"If you approached most people theyd likely be interested, just matter of finding someone with the credentials"
21-03-2018T21:36:07,BluePhantom90,Just be lucky we are not like Starwars Fans that might murder you for changing the story just slightly!
21-03-2018T21:36:21,WIPKING,TOM i just relized you were 17 when you made the first comic

21-03-2018T21:59:59,Bigboi182,Ok
21-03-2018T22:00:08,Dadrobit,"Not my dad, not nearly enough cursing and throwing of wrenches."
21-03-2018T22:00:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
21-03-2018T22:00:31,Sammit,Hi everybody
21-03-2018T22:00:34,Bigboi182,My Father just likes going out.

21-03-2018T22:00:42,Bigboi182,TO the same place.
21-03-2018T22:00:50,Bigboi182,ALMOST EVERY DAY.
21-03-2018T22:00:54,TomFurson,to get pizza
21-03-2018T22:00:56,Sammit,Hi Robit
21-03-2018T22:01:13,Bigboi182,To get seafood.
21-03-2018T22:01:26,TomFurson,better than pizza
21-03-2018T22:01:43,Bigboi182,"If I didn't like seafood, I would've hated him."
21-03-2018T22:01:49,Bigboi182,But I don't.
21-03-2018T22:01:59,Bigboi182,So I kinda like him.
21-03-2018T22:02:00,TomFurson,Every time my dad and I go out he wants to get pizza. I do not know y
21-03-2018T22:02:15,Bigboi182,He has his reasons.
21-03-2018T22:02:26,Bigboi182,His really WEIRD reasons..
21-03-2018T22:04:10,TomFurson,In a way I like being at college but then it leaves me alone with my thoughts.
21-03-2018T22:04:49,Bigboi182,At least you're not entirely alone...
21-03-2018T22:04:49,TomFurson,Which in the long term is not good. It has already taken its tole
21-03-2018T22:05:19,TomFurson,I am a very anit-social person so... ya
21-03-2018T22:14:53,SpazztasticKiwi,So are we still prepping or has the stream been put on hold
21-03-2018T22:16:15,TomFurson,It is off
21-03-2018T22:18:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Do we know why or did it just go off
21-03-2018T22:18:36,TorqueEmUp,Tom wants to get these last few pages done right
21-03-2018T22:18:44,TorqueEmUp,So needs more time
21-03-2018T22:18:59,TorqueEmUp,For the end of the chapter
21-03-2018T22:21:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah
21-03-2018T22:24:44,TomFurson,Do you know if he will just do an art stream tomorrow?
21-03-2018T22:26:45,TorqueEmUp,He'll do whatever he feels like doing
21-03-2018T22:26:46,TorqueEmUp,:
21-03-2018T22:26:48,TorqueEmUp,:P
21-03-2018T22:27:23,TomFurson,Well of course. His stream his rules.
21-03-2018T22:32:42,Ordithus,"He's done comics on Fridays before, but yes his stream his rules."
21-03-2018T22:34:33,Bgrmystr2,Comics used to be on Friday
21-03-2018T22:34:39,Bgrmystr2,before he made Wed his comic day
21-03-2018T22:34:47,Bgrmystr2,and Friday let him draw stuff like the nora cards
21-03-2018T22:34:59,Bgrmystr2,stuff like that
21-03-2018T22:35:23,Bgrmystr2,sometimes he would miss Wed and do the comic on Fri instead
21-03-2018T22:35:53,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah, it's going to be a bit more random now"
21-03-2018T22:37:23,WIPKING,You guys are still here
21-03-2018T22:37:34,Bgrmystr2,We live here.

21-03-2018T22:41:11,WIPKING,"Ya know im most likely to forget about this inna bout 7 months, when that happens ill be 18 or 19 and my mom will give me back the book i bought for 30 dollars, and run back here where this would have exploded or completely stoped."
21-03-2018T22:42:55,WIPKING,"So i enjoyed for a good week but now ill wait another 4 to 5 years for three more chapters, like how it worked its way up while i was a kid."
21-03-2018T22:43:56,WIPKING,Or ill die in car crash or somthing abd nobody here will never know.
21-03-2018T22:44:28,Vatruvius,Don't talk like that...that is horrible.
21-03-2018T22:44:36,WIPKING,Life is life it prepares us for the after life
21-03-2018T22:45:22,WIPKING,After you die you live for a eternity in heven based on what you did in your life
21-03-2018T22:46:25,WIPKING,Im just glad i got to say this when nobody was typing
21-03-2018T22:46:39,WIPKING,Bye for now
21-03-2018T22:47:30,TomFurson,bye?

21-03-2018T23:04:17,WIPKING,No because now its night
21-03-2018T23:04:33,WIPKING,It doesnt matter what the hell i do at night
21-03-2018T23:05:58,Vatruvius,It is strange to think I discovered this comic three weeks ago and discovered this stream just two weeks ago.
21-03-2018T23:07:53,TomFurson,Did all of that in less that a week
21-03-2018T23:08:02,TomFurson,this week
21-03-2018T23:12:47,Bgrmystr2,"you don't get to complain about the time you wasted of your own accord, WIP"
21-03-2018T23:12:52,Bigboi182,Why can't I see the people here?
21-03-2018T23:12:52,Bgrmystr2,that was your choice
21-03-2018T23:12:54,Bgrmystr2,noone elses.

21-03-2018T23:13:15,Bigboi182,"I just had to reload, sorry."
21-03-2018T23:13:24,Bigboi182,"So, what did I miss."
21-03-2018T23:13:40,Bigboi182,"Don't worry, I know there was no stream."
21-03-2018T23:13:45,SpazztasticKiwi,A mess
21-03-2018T23:13:54,Bigboi182,I was there for the whole conversation.
21-03-2018T23:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,🙃
21-03-2018T23:14:03,Bigboi182,"About the stream, I mean"
21-03-2018T23:14:39,TomFurson,ya too bad of Oh well. I hope it did not stress him out not doing the stream
21-03-2018T23:14:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn’t - I was closing
21-03-2018T23:14:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Work
21-03-2018T23:15:05,CrimsonHelsing,"I wasn't here for that, what happened?"
21-03-2018T23:15:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure Tom’s a chill enough guy that he’ll be fine
21-03-2018T23:15:42,TomFurson,Oh he need to do some catch up work
21-03-2018T23:16:02,TomFurson,So he could not do the stream
21-03-2018T23:16:52,CrimsonHelsing,Ahh
21-03-2018T23:19:01,TheBeckoner,*sigh* site reloaded...chat gone. I have concluded however there is no stream lol
21-03-2018T23:19:34,TomFurson,lol
21-03-2018T23:22:19,Bgrmystr2,"lol Beck, coulda told you that"
21-03-2018T23:23:23,TheBeckoner,I guess Tom is just catching up today?
21-03-2018T23:23:31,TorqueEmUp,indeed
21-03-2018T23:23:48,TorqueEmUp,"wants to get the last few pages of the chapter done right, not quickly"
21-03-2018T23:24:00,TheBeckoner,Huh wednesday got taken off the stream schedule
21-03-2018T23:24:22,TheBeckoner,Understandable. wednesdays were hit or miss anyhow.
21-03-2018T23:24:41,TheBeckoner,And quality is always better than speed
21-03-2018T23:24:45,TheBeckoner,usually
21-03-2018T23:25:00,TorqueEmUp,I see no schedual banner actually now that you mention it.
21-03-2018T23:25:21,TorqueEmUp,schedule*
21-03-2018T23:25:35,TheBeckoner,Just reload
21-03-2018T23:25:45,TheBeckoner,mine only has friday and sunday
21-03-2018T23:26:01,TorqueEmUp,yeah I must've loaded the page when he was switching it up or something
21-03-2018T23:26:14,Bgrmystr2,he switched it a while back
21-03-2018T23:26:23,Bgrmystr2,a couple hours ago
21-03-2018T23:26:31,TorqueEmUp,yeah when I first got here
21-03-2018T23:26:33,TorqueEmUp,:P
21-03-2018T23:26:33,TheBeckoner,yeah I've been gone for a few hours.
21-03-2018T23:26:46,TheBeckoner,Also I never reload lool
21-03-2018T23:26:56,Bgrmystr2,you prolly should
21-03-2018T23:27:04,TheBeckoner,Prolly
21-03-2018T23:27:04,TomFurson,Well I am going to head off . Until tomorrow keep forsty
21-03-2018T23:27:11,TheBeckoner,Night
21-03-2018T23:27:18,Bgrmystr2,"anycase, I'm kind of torn on the wed stream being removed"
21-03-2018T23:27:31,TorqueEmUp,same
21-03-2018T23:27:43,Bgrmystr2,"cuz when he started it, it was like lighting a fire under him. giving him a schedule to keep and incentive to push forward"
21-03-2018T23:27:53,Bgrmystr2,couldn't fuck aroun
21-03-2018T23:27:54,Bgrmystr2,d
21-03-2018T23:28:32,Vatruvius,"I like the consistancy, something I can be certain is there and I can look forward to but it starts while I am at school so I always miss and hour or two so, maybe now it will be better for my schedule."
21-03-2018T23:28:43,Vatruvius,As long as Tom is good and the comic continues I will be fine.
21-03-2018T23:28:56,TheBeckoner,How were things pre-wednesday?
21-03-2018T23:29:07,Bgrmystr2,before that he would usually do the comic on Fri
21-03-2018T23:29:15,Bgrmystr2,and upload it on Sat
21-03-2018T23:29:26,TheBeckoner,And only do friday?
21-03-2018T23:29:34,unsteddyphoenix,"I think he still plans to stream during the week, just not necessarily on wednesday"
21-03-2018T23:29:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah
21-03-2018T23:30:14,Bgrmystr2,I just hope he doesn't get lax because the lack of schedule
21-03-2018T23:30:20,TheBeckoner,Not that it matters but Tuesdays work better for me lol
21-03-2018T23:30:22,Bgrmystr2,cuz that was the whole point of the schedule to begin with
21-03-2018T23:30:46,Vatruvius,"It is kinda nice to feel like I belong to a community again, been a while since that happened. A community of nice people too which is a plus."
21-03-2018T23:31:08,Bgrmystr2,"""nice people"" far and few between :thinking:"
21-03-2018T23:31:17,Bgrmystr2,but a few stand out
21-03-2018T23:31:19,Bgrmystr2,for the most part
21-03-2018T23:31:36,Vatruvius,Most that type in this chat are nice I would say.
21-03-2018T23:31:43,TheBeckoner,u  suc
21-03-2018T23:31:53,Vatruvius,:ptv-sad:
21-03-2018T23:31:53,Bgrmystr2,"judge not a book by it's cover, Vatru"
21-03-2018T23:32:08,Vatruvius,I never do Bgr
21-03-2018T23:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"I am not nice, I am a tiny demon"
21-03-2018T23:32:20,TheBeckoner,lilspazzdemon
21-03-2018T23:32:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Fear me 👻
21-03-2018T23:32:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Thankfully I am very nice, so it balances out."
21-03-2018T23:32:41,Bgrmystr2,the chat on stream is standard fare. You won't really find a lot of drama here.
21-03-2018T23:32:44,Vatruvius,Yes...clearly not nice at all! :ptv-hearts:
21-03-2018T23:32:47,TheBeckoner,idk I aim for neutral-ish
21-03-2018T23:32:52,Bgrmystr2,now if you find the same people here elsewhere..
21-03-2018T23:33:14,Bgrmystr2,I can attest that phoenix is a pretty cool dood who doesn't afraid of many things.
21-03-2018T23:33:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And likes cats
21-03-2018T23:33:30,TheBeckoner,what about the tomate?
21-03-2018T23:33:33,Bgrmystr2,and kats
21-03-2018T23:34:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It looks like you nearly called Tom a tomato 🍅
21-03-2018T23:34:02,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
21-03-2018T23:34:38,TheBeckoner,What produce item is Tom?
21-03-2018T23:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom-ato
21-03-2018T23:34:59,Vatruvius,So I assume Tom is keeping to the Sketch and Color stream schedule and doing the pages at some point in that week?
21-03-2018T23:35:23,unsteddyphoenix,Look at this guy over here ASSUMING things
21-03-2018T23:35:27,unsteddyphoenix,(yes)
21-03-2018T23:36:07,Vatruvius,Thanks...I think? :ptv-wondering:
21-03-2018T23:36:19,Vatruvius,:P
21-03-2018T23:37:23,Vatruvius,Ah...oh! I have reached my 666th video in my playlist...
21-03-2018T23:37:38,Vatruvius,SKIP
21-03-2018T23:38:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Just straight up demon noises start playing
21-03-2018T23:39:00,Bgrmystr2,"most likely that tom will still keep the same schedule he has currently. Stream a page update during the week, The friday stream for miscellaneous art, and sunday for the patreon sketch stream."
21-03-2018T23:39:05,Vatruvius,"Mewahahahahahahahahah! *dramatic fires start everywhere, dimming and reding of lights*"
21-03-2018T23:39:26,Bgrmystr2,it's just that the page stream won't be scheduled for Wed.
21-03-2018T23:39:33,Bgrmystr2,it'll be whenever it happens
21-03-2018T23:39:42,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, the page is sometimes early, sometimes late, but"
21-03-2018T23:39:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Fortunately, I’m so scatter brained any demon trying to influence me would tear its hair out in frustration"
21-03-2018T23:40:00,SpazztasticKiwi,“Kill the person next to you...”
21-03-2018T23:40:01,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, it'll allow him more freedom to do what he wants to do during the week"
21-03-2018T23:40:16,Vatruvius,That is cool...I have no problem with it.
21-03-2018T23:40:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Oh, look - dishes! Gotta do them first”"
21-03-2018T23:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,“I quit”
21-03-2018T23:40:39,Vatruvius,lol
21-03-2018T23:40:45,Bgrmystr2,he may feel like doing the page early in the week
21-03-2018T23:40:51,Bgrmystr2,like on Mon
21-03-2018T23:40:53,Bgrmystr2,and get it out of the way
21-03-2018T23:41:00,Bgrmystr2,or maybe he wants to do it thurs
21-03-2018T23:41:04,Bgrmystr2,who knows
21-03-2018T23:41:22,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, he could even do it on fri"
21-03-2018T23:41:56,Bgrmystr2,I think it was just a lot of mental stress of not being able to keep up with a schedule that fell apart quite a few times
21-03-2018T23:42:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"If anything happens Friday the 30th, I’m gonna be unavailable"
21-03-2018T23:42:10,Vatruvius,That is what it has been the past few weeks I have been here. I just need to figure out a way for my phone to alert me to the picarto.tv alerts.
21-03-2018T23:42:21,Bgrmystr2,"like the friday stream, Kiwi?"
21-03-2018T23:42:24,Bgrmystr2,as they usually do?
21-03-2018T23:42:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah..
21-03-2018T23:42:44,Bgrmystr2,yeah... then you'll prolly miss the fri stream
21-03-2018T23:42:48,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's kinda normal
21-03-2018T23:43:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll be in Atlanta at Seán’s show
21-03-2018T23:43:32,Bgrmystr2,you gonna punch that like button in the face?
21-03-2018T23:44:00,SpazztasticKiwi,He’ll be onstage. Hopefully I don’t punch anything
21-03-2018T23:44:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause that’s assault
