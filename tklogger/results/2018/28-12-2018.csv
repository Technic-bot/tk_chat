28-12-2018T00:01:32,Ordithus,Probably just doesn't like it
28-12-2018T00:05:00,Ordithus,So what's in this AI page?  More stairs?
28-12-2018T00:06:09,Ordithus,:ptv-excited:
28-12-2018T00:06:53,Twokinds,ALL the stairs!
28-12-2018T00:07:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Heya Tom
28-12-2018T00:07:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
28-12-2018T00:07:38,BadFoMo,All two of the stairs!
28-12-2018T00:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm on mobile
28-12-2018T00:07:52,SageSaga,Tom - Do you have the audio on?
28-12-2018T00:08:14,Twokinds,Not at the moment
28-12-2018T00:08:29,BadFoMo,Type lowder. I can't hear.
28-12-2018T00:08:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt encourage them to yell
28-12-2018T00:08:57,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs the last thing we need
28-12-2018T00:09:27,BadFoMo,@Nekonny I like the music.
28-12-2018T00:10:11,Ordithus,"Fit it into the spaces, BETWEEN the panels"
28-12-2018T00:10:29,Twokinds,I hear voices!
28-12-2018T00:10:45,Twokinds,Also japanese music
28-12-2018T00:10:55,BadFoMo,"""We all up inside your brain."""
28-12-2018T00:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom that‚Äôs not something you wanna really announce
28-12-2018T00:11:27,Twokinds,Oh there must be quite a delay
28-12-2018T00:11:29,BadFoMo,"Also, guess where I stole that one."
28-12-2018T00:12:06,SageSaga,GOMODO
28-12-2018T00:12:27,Twokinds,now
28-12-2018T00:12:49,Mihari,near 30 seconds of it
28-12-2018T00:13:14,BadFoMo,Oh... That explans a lot.
28-12-2018T00:13:36,Ordithus,"They say something, 30 seconds later we hear it and type something, 30 seconds later yet we hear the response"
28-12-2018T00:13:41,Ordithus,:fire:
28-12-2018T00:13:41,Twokinds,Quite a bit.
28-12-2018T00:13:51,Twokinds,"Unusual, I didn't think Picarto was quite that time delayed."
28-12-2018T00:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Chats definitely quicker
28-12-2018T00:14:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,30 seconds is the norm from what I'v seen in streams
28-12-2018T00:14:37,Bgrmystr2,Yeah 20-40 seconds of delay is fairly standard for a lot of people
28-12-2018T00:15:18,Ordithus,What happened to the speed of light :ctwokinds-flomad:
28-12-2018T00:15:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,to expensive
28-12-2018T00:16:05,BadFoMo,@Nekonny This reminds me of The Littles.

28-12-2018T00:20:12,Twokinds,Does anyone know the board game where you have little soldier pieces and can't see the opponents pieces?
28-12-2018T00:20:21,Twokinds,I'm having the darnest time trying to google it.
28-12-2018T00:20:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh
28-12-2018T00:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Battleship?
28-12-2018T00:20:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^?
28-12-2018T00:20:40,Twokinds,no soldiers on a battlefield
28-12-2018T00:20:43,Ordithus,"Those are ships, Kiwi"
28-12-2018T00:20:44,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs all I got
28-12-2018T00:20:48,Twokinds,And there's like a spy
28-12-2018T00:20:50,Twokinds,and bombs
28-12-2018T00:20:58,Twokinds,and they all have different values
28-12-2018T00:20:58,BadFoMo,How is it played?
28-12-2018T00:21:02,Twokinds,And you have to find the commander
28-12-2018T00:21:04,Ordithus,I do not know
28-12-2018T00:21:04,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
28-12-2018T00:21:15,Bgrmystr2,"My dad would probably know, but it's super late"
28-12-2018T00:21:16,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôve lost me
28-12-2018T00:21:21,Bgrmystr2,so I wouldn't be able to call him up
28-12-2018T00:21:36,Twokinds,"It's like a line of classic, 18th century soldiers"
28-12-2018T00:21:42,Bgrmystr2,Risk?
28-12-2018T00:21:42,Twokinds,You're all in lines.
28-12-2018T00:21:57,Ordithus,I'm in a line? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
28-12-2018T00:22:03,Bgrmystr2,"Risk is kinda like that, but I think you can see your enemy in it"
28-12-2018T00:22:05,Twokinds,Yeah rows of soldiers
28-12-2018T00:22:14,Tharkis,i know the one you're talking about
28-12-2018T00:22:16,Tharkis,cant think of hte name
28-12-2018T00:22:46,BadFoMo,Have you tried looking on BoardGameGeaks?
28-12-2018T00:23:02,Tharkis,I think it might have been published by Avalon Hill
28-12-2018T00:23:04,Twokinds,Stratego!
28-12-2018T00:23:07,Twokinds,"Found it, finally."
28-12-2018T00:23:23,Ordithus,I've heard of that.  Seems I have no idea what it is like
28-12-2018T00:23:30,BadFoMo,Same.

28-12-2018T00:24:01,Bgrmystr2,I've heard of it
28-12-2018T00:24:02,Twokinds,"Sage, you don't?"
28-12-2018T00:24:43,Twokinds,lol

28-12-2018T00:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,And it‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpazz‚Äù + ‚Äútastic‚Äù as in ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù
28-12-2018T00:26:41,Twokinds,I've always thought spazz was pretty harmless.
28-12-2018T00:27:13,Twokinds,"Well, yeah, but it's kinda jokey negative"
28-12-2018T00:27:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"The base point is, it doesn‚Äôt bother me if you slip up and say Spazz"
28-12-2018T00:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you want to use Kiwi, I don‚Äôt care"
28-12-2018T00:27:55,SpazztasticKiwi,You do it very carefully
28-12-2018T00:28:04,BadFoMo,What is it?
28-12-2018T00:28:30,Tharkis,we named one of our cats Spazz

28-12-2018T00:33:24,Ordithus,You can do eet!
28-12-2018T00:33:41,Twokinds,lol
28-12-2018T00:34:14,Ordithus,Yosh has quite a bit of it
28-12-2018T00:34:15,Twokinds,I gotta draw this big lizard lizarding around in action

28-12-2018T00:34:40,Twokinds,"Like, sequentially. So it 'flows' or whatever"
28-12-2018T00:34:43,unsteddyphoenix,Hire a choreographer
28-12-2018T00:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Study a lizard video
28-12-2018T00:35:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,look to the berserk manga for action refrence
28-12-2018T00:35:33,Twokinds,I wanted to give the lizard an otherworldly quality by styling it differently.
28-12-2018T00:35:37,Bgrmystr2,Tom you know about the 'line of action' yeah?
28-12-2018T00:35:51,Twokinds,"Sorta unsettling to make it seem like it's still part of the scenery, even as it's moving."
28-12-2018T00:36:11,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if that'll help, but somethin I read about when people did actions scenes"
28-12-2018T00:36:38,Bgrmystr2,"and it's supposed to be unsettling, isn't it? It's a moving statue lol"
28-12-2018T00:36:47,Twokinds,"Also, it's good painting practice."

28-12-2018T00:38:51,Twokinds,"Yeah, and once TK is done, I can start my first REAL comic!"
28-12-2018T00:38:56,unsteddyphoenix,The whole progression throughout the comic is pretty amazing

28-12-2018T02:17:57,TheBeckoner,Cinnamon toast and bacon
28-12-2018T02:18:06,Rosscoe,"I do not have a waffle iron sadly, or even one to stick on a stove top :ptv-whiny:"
28-12-2018T02:18:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Just bacon
28-12-2018T02:18:21,TheBeckoner,gotta balance it Marrv
28-12-2018T02:18:49,Rosscoe,Guess I'll pan fry some brisket and put it on a bun
28-12-2018T02:18:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'm not thanos, I don't need to balance"
28-12-2018T02:18:59,Rosscoe,not the greatest of choices for breakfest XD
28-12-2018T02:21:12,TheBeckoner,Sounds good tho
28-12-2018T02:26:35,Rosscoe,"By the way, have you all heard the word of the Nyan Daki avaible for sale? You all should order one so Phil here will be out of stock :ptv-greetings:"
28-12-2018T02:27:33,Bgrmystr2,"yes we all know, he mentioned it a bunch earlier"
28-12-2018T02:27:40,Bgrmystr2,several times during the stream in fact :P
28-12-2018T02:30:05,Rosscoe,Even Phil wagers his Kaylin Daki will be sold out before Nyan cause of the amount of reveled skin :ptv-ohmy:
28-12-2018T02:30:46,SageSaga,no i dont
28-12-2018T02:31:05,SageSaga,Kaylin has sold the least so far
28-12-2018T02:31:22,Rosscoe,Wow really?
28-12-2018T02:31:30,Rosscoe,Even I thought she'd be doing better
28-12-2018T02:33:20,Rosscoe,Busty Elve's must be out this season.
28-12-2018T02:33:20,SageSaga,gotta sell 3 more
28-12-2018T02:38:09,Rosscoe,Sadly I'm not into Daki-mora' :(
28-12-2018T02:38:58,Rosscoe,As cool as it would be to just use the cover as  a poster I am not sure my future girl friend would accept that :ptv-kippi2:
28-12-2018T02:39:20,Bgrmystr2,dakimakura
28-12-2018T02:39:30,SageSaga,if your girlfriend doesnt approve- are they really a friend at all?
28-12-2018T02:39:33,Rosscoe,"Also small correction on my part, its not brisket meat, its phily steak"
28-12-2018T02:39:36,Bgrmystr2,"if a future girlfriend doesn't accept a hobby, is she really worth your time at all?"
28-12-2018T02:40:00,Rosscoe,"and that Daki bit,  I should just call it Daki for short from now on"
28-12-2018T02:40:11,Bgrmystr2,most people do
28-12-2018T02:40:17,Bgrmystr2,instead of calling it dakiasiurgiajsfh
28-12-2018T02:40:20,Bgrmystr2,:v
28-12-2018T02:40:42,SageSaga,I have a friend that would have trouble taking it away from his girlfriend...
28-12-2018T02:40:47,Rosscoe,"WHelp, between table top war gaming, fixing motorbikes, starting two new jobs in 2019 (Land lord and anti dryer fire prevetion person), hard to say"
28-12-2018T02:41:50,Rosscoe,"I mean if girls have pictures of the lead signer for a boy band all over their coach, why can't I have a body pillow to help me sleep XD"
28-12-2018T02:41:53,TheBeckoner,The second job has me intrigued

28-12-2018T02:51:14,Rosscoe,"This sucks, I have no pre packaged BBQ sauces left"
28-12-2018T02:51:22,Rosscoe,Garlic ketchup it is :ptv-shock:
28-12-2018T02:53:37,Rosscoe,That is quite the jump
28-12-2018T02:56:40,TheBeckoner,garlic ketchup?
28-12-2018T02:56:45,TheBeckoner,is that something you made?
28-12-2018T02:58:22,Rosscoe,"You can, but this one is already made that way, just like the bottle of Buffalo BBQ ketchuo"
28-12-2018T02:58:42,Rosscoe,By French's
28-12-2018T03:01:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"12 am and now I'm hungry, thanks ross"

28-12-2018T03:43:48,Rosscoe,Shouldn;t be too hard. Sage has lots of characters
28-12-2018T03:45:09,Rosscoe,"Heeeey, I justfound a pre-made desert waffle in my mini fridge freezer."
28-12-2018T03:46:06,ZRO4825,Sage's characters aren't the hard part of figuring out what I want for my request! :P
28-12-2018T03:47:25,Rosscoe,You will think of something :ptv-victory:
28-12-2018T03:47:51,Rosscoe,And I just realized I keep spell Nyna as Nyan :ptv-confused:
28-12-2018T03:48:25,ZRO4825,lol
28-12-2018T03:49:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,is that a snoot?
28-12-2018T03:49:29,Rosscoe,Looks like a snoot
28-12-2018T03:49:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,must boop
28-12-2018T03:49:56,Rosscoe,"Hmmm, that black lip to eye edge line, looks like a Mihari"

28-12-2018T03:50:20,Rosscoe,Could be another Cheeta
28-12-2018T03:50:28,Bgrmystr2,it's gonna be Mihari
28-12-2018T03:50:35,Rosscoe,No doubt there
28-12-2018T03:50:53,Bgrmystr2,"If it's Sage, and he's drawing a cheetah, it's gonna be Mihari"
28-12-2018T03:51:01,Bgrmystr2,the chances are like 99.9%
28-12-2018T03:51:40,Rosscoe,"A .1% chances for Sage to go full 360 and go ""NOPE!"""
28-12-2018T03:51:54,Bgrmystr2,there ARE other cheetah characters other than Mihari
28-12-2018T03:52:03,SageSaga,you sure?
28-12-2018T03:52:07,Bgrmystr2,yeah
28-12-2018T03:52:40,Bgrmystr2,"but the chances of someone knowing of it, following you, AND being on your patreon to suggest it.."
28-12-2018T03:52:59,Bgrmystr2,presuming they even do suggest it.
28-12-2018T03:54:46,Rosscoe,Looking like new years
28-12-2018T03:56:23,SageSaga,yep
28-12-2018T04:10:50,Rosscoe,"Kaylin winky at Mihari, what heresy of NSFW will come of this!"

28-12-2018T12:04:38,CrimsonQuill,I love that sketch. The fact that there's an outline to where Nibs WAS as well as showing her hit by the snowball makes it all the more hilarious.
28-12-2018T15:01:28,BadFoMo,Yo.
28-12-2018T15:02:04,SageSaga,yo

28-12-2018T15:07:50,Rosscoe,@SageSaga Nope! Not yet anyways
28-12-2018T15:10:55,Mippy,Holy carp it‚Äôs snowing hard today
28-12-2018T15:11:10,Rosscoe,"We had abit of snow last night, now its rained it all away"
28-12-2018T15:11:27,Rosscoe,"and a section of the roof at work,well, has a big leak now"
28-12-2018T15:11:54,Bgrmystr2,all rain last night for what we had.
28-12-2018T15:14:19,BadFoMo,How did part of the ear get magically filled in?
28-12-2018T15:14:25,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
28-12-2018T15:14:33,BadFoMo,Hi.
28-12-2018T15:15:02,Mippy,"Dunno, I haven‚Äôt got to play much with Clip yet :csagesaga-c1:"
28-12-2018T15:15:32,Bgrmystr2,probably a fill tool? It's something even paint had
28-12-2018T15:15:44,Bgrmystr2,not magical at all
28-12-2018T15:15:59,SageSaga,im using a tool called close and fill- it is a mix of a selection and a fill tool that also looks for small gaps that should be closed
28-12-2018T15:16:11,Bgrmystr2,ooh that one
28-12-2018T15:16:13,BadFoMo,Ah.
28-12-2018T15:16:20,BadFoMo,Thanks.
28-12-2018T15:16:26,Mippy,Oh....good to know.
28-12-2018T15:16:37,Bgrmystr2,I remember you talking about that before.
28-12-2018T15:16:59,Mippy,Got a free trial of Clip so it‚Äôs nice to learn a bit.
28-12-2018T15:19:39,CatzArt,Hello all! Fear not I have arrived!
28-12-2018T15:19:52,BadFoMo,Yo.
28-12-2018T15:22:33,Rosscoe,Hoi Catz!
28-12-2018T15:24:44,sunblaze,hiya everyone
28-12-2018T15:24:53,CatzArt,Hiya Sun!
28-12-2018T15:25:32,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
28-12-2018T15:25:52,Rosscoe,Hi Sun
28-12-2018T15:26:05,Rosscoe,"Man, Nyna get real crazy in this page eh"
28-12-2018T15:27:06,CatzArt,not enough cross bows. can never have enough cross bows
28-12-2018T15:28:50,Bgrmystr2,That's their first problem. If they're not using Guided Arrow against an enemy like Nyna.. they're bound to fail
28-12-2018T15:29:08,Bgrmystr2,or Multishot at they very least.
28-12-2018T15:29:24,CatzArt,thats why you need more crossbows
28-12-2018T15:29:35,Bgrmystr2,more doesn't solve the problem. xD
28-12-2018T15:29:44,Rosscoe,"Maybe Nyna is secertly a.....""Witcher"", defelcting bolts left right and centre XD"
28-12-2018T15:30:41,Bgrmystr2,Why would she need to though?
28-12-2018T15:30:49,Bgrmystr2,she's too fast to be hit by them in the first place
28-12-2018T15:32:02,Rosscoe,I'm just being silly :ptv-sneakysmirk:
28-12-2018T15:32:07,CatzArt,I remember that you could overpower the dwarven crossbow is Skyrim.
28-12-2018T15:32:15,CatzArt,good times
28-12-2018T15:35:35,Bgrmystr2,enchant crossbow to shoot explosive fire arrows. <3
28-12-2018T15:37:36,CatzArt,you could already get ice fire and shock bolts from the Dawnguard. Then enchant the crossbow itself and boom overpowered crossbow
28-12-2018T15:39:30,Bgrmystr2,just enchant it with all three elements at once.
28-12-2018T15:39:52,CrimsonQuill,"Hello, Catz! Spartan Crimson Quill Reporting in."

28-12-2018T15:40:44,Bgrmystr2,"and then smack the thing with damage increases, attack speed increases, and give it Immolation Arrow."
28-12-2018T15:40:48,SageSaga,yo
28-12-2018T15:40:55,Bgrmystr2,I'll take that thing anyday of the week <3
28-12-2018T15:40:57,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Brgmystr2
28-12-2018T15:41:01,Bgrmystr2,hey Quill
28-12-2018T15:41:05,CrimsonQuill,Is this Yosh or A.I.?
28-12-2018T15:41:09,Bgrmystr2,AI
28-12-2018T15:41:15,Bgrmystr2,He always works on AI today
28-12-2018T15:41:21,Bgrmystr2,he never works on Yosh on stream
28-12-2018T15:41:44,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, I see-it's that last guy from the tavern."
28-12-2018T15:41:49,CatzArt,You could get the enhanced dwarven crossbow which has 50% armor negation
28-12-2018T15:42:06,CrimsonQuill,@CatzArt Dwarven Crossbow?
28-12-2018T15:42:42,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think it would need to at that point, Catz xD"
28-12-2018T15:42:44,CatzArt,Yup In the Skyrim DLC Dawnguard you could get crossbows to fight vampires.
28-12-2018T15:43:34,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
28-12-2018T15:43:41,CrimsonQuill,I have Skyrim Base game.
28-12-2018T15:44:09,CrimsonQuill,"Starting again from scratch, because I mucked up badly."
28-12-2018T15:45:33,CrimsonQuill,OH CRUMBS.
28-12-2018T15:45:50,CrimsonQuill,I've just been seeing what Nyna does to a room full of thugs...
28-12-2018T15:45:56,CatzArt,If you ever need pointers ask me. I have that game down to a science. For instance in Helgen when Hadvar or Ralof cut your bindings make sure they dont get the key. then crouch behind em and hit em every five seconds to level up your sneak
28-12-2018T15:46:26,CrimsonQuill,@CatzArt I never knew that. That's cool.
28-12-2018T15:46:32,CrimsonQuill,"Also, fun fact."
28-12-2018T15:47:24,CrimsonQuill,"When I started Halo with Halo 4, after getting to know the game, I saw the Grunts as joke characters...until Heroic, and legendary, where they'd SUICIDE RUSH ME, or take me out with Fuel Rod cannons."
28-12-2018T15:47:35,CrimsonQuill,Also-Halo Reach. Gruntpocalypse.
28-12-2018T15:47:45,CrimsonQuill,Legendary difficulty. Even Heroic.
28-12-2018T15:47:53,CrimsonQuill,NEVER underestimate the Grunts...
28-12-2018T15:48:30,CatzArt,Crimson. My friend and I have a yearly tradition where we run through every halo game on the Master Chief collection with legendary all skulls on.
28-12-2018T15:48:42,CrimsonQuill,WAIT.
28-12-2018T15:48:57,CrimsonQuill,YOU'VE ACTUALLY...COMPLETED LASO.
28-12-2018T15:49:03,CrimsonQuill,ON HALO.
28-12-2018T15:49:33,Bgrmystr2,Duh? Lots of people have
28-12-2018T15:49:38,CatzArt,On every halo game except five. because we think that game is a discrace to halo
28-12-2018T15:49:48,Bgrmystr2,It's extremely difficult and time consuming
28-12-2018T15:49:55,Rosscoe,"I ony played Halo 1, and some of 2"
28-12-2018T15:50:01,Bgrmystr2,but yeah I've done LASO on all Halos before.
28-12-2018T15:50:18,CatzArt,Halo one is the worst as it wasnt designed for skulls.
28-12-2018T15:50:30,CrimsonQuill,I have NEVER even made it 5 SECONDS into Halo LASO before dying.
28-12-2018T15:50:40,Bgrmystr2,I'd disagree with that Catz
28-12-2018T15:50:45,CrimsonQuill,I'm not sure if it's something I should try....
28-12-2018T15:51:07,CatzArt,let me guess do you think halo 2 was the worst?
28-12-2018T15:51:11,Bgrmystr2,lol no
28-12-2018T15:51:27,CatzArt,which then Bgr?
28-12-2018T15:51:29,Bgrmystr2,I actually consider 3 being the hardest / most time consuming
28-12-2018T15:51:36,Bgrmystr2,for LASO
28-12-2018T15:51:48,CrimsonQuill,I think I'll stick to Legendary normal as highest.
28-12-2018T15:51:53,Bgrmystr2,though I geuss 3 would be Mythic
28-12-2018T15:51:55,CrimsonQuill,Maybe a few skulls here or there...
28-12-2018T15:52:27,CrimsonQuill,"I read that in Reach, beating 'Pillar of Autumn' in Mythic is entirely LUCK based."
28-12-2018T15:52:46,CatzArt,how so?
28-12-2018T15:52:52,Bgrmystr2,well you read wrong
28-12-2018T15:53:08,Bgrmystr2,it's basically about paitence and skill.
28-12-2018T15:53:35,Bgrmystr2,you do get lucky sometimes
28-12-2018T15:53:36,CrimsonQuill,"Apparently, since you have to hit the cruiser TWICE with the MAC, it depends on luck as to whether or not you're killed before the second shot."
28-12-2018T15:53:39,Bgrmystr2,but it's not about luck
28-12-2018T15:56:02,CatzArt,"A weird halo quirk for me and my friend is that every time we shoot a bugger and it explodes into bits. we developed a cereal brand called Yanme'e Flakes Where in our best Sgt Johnson voice we yell ""its so crunchy""."
28-12-2018T15:58:13,CatzArt,its very weird
28-12-2018T15:59:03,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, the only person I can really play Halo with is my brother, on splitscreen."
28-12-2018T15:59:25,CrimsonQuill,But I'm going to save up for an XBOX one so that I can go Live...and play Infinite when it comes out.
28-12-2018T16:00:41,CatzArt,I'll look forward to it. well see if infinite can bring me back into the modern halo games after the debacle that was halo 5
28-12-2018T16:01:13,CrimsonQuill,"I admit, 5 is my least fafvourite."
28-12-2018T16:01:27,CrimsonQuill,I wish it was more about ONI vs Chief than an Evil Cortana.
28-12-2018T16:02:02,Rosscoe,I have this urge to reisntall teh SIms3
28-12-2018T16:02:09,Grip,hi
28-12-2018T16:02:14,CrimsonQuill,hi
28-12-2018T16:02:16,Rosscoe,tHi Grip!
28-12-2018T16:02:31,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, Nyna just PLOUGHS through thugs."
28-12-2018T16:03:19,sunblaze,yessss its awesome :D
28-12-2018T16:04:22,CatzArt,Hiya Grip!
28-12-2018T16:04:38,CrimsonQuill,What music is this?
28-12-2018T16:04:52,Bgrmystr2,SageStreamMusic.mp3
28-12-2018T16:05:19,CrimsonQuill,haha
28-12-2018T16:05:29,sunblaze,stranger things soundtrack
28-12-2018T16:05:48,SageSaga,just the main theme
28-12-2018T16:06:05,SageSaga,i like the music from Stranger things but a lot of it sucks as a stand alone track
28-12-2018T16:06:59,CrimsonQuill,Interesting
28-12-2018T16:07:13,CrimsonQuill,I think of those synthy space themes listening to that.
28-12-2018T16:29:47,CrimsonQuill,"This looks really cool Sage,"
28-12-2018T16:34:02,CrimsonQuill,@CatzArt Do you watch HiddenXperia?
28-12-2018T16:34:13,CrimsonQuill,He does great Halo videos.
28-12-2018T16:34:37,CrimsonQuill,@CatzArt
28-12-2018T16:40:12,Bgrmystr2,Clearly Catz is not here anymore lol
28-12-2018T16:40:16,Bgrmystr2,probably on mobile
28-12-2018T16:40:31,CrimsonQuill,Maybe
28-12-2018T16:55:51,sunblaze,those bandits are morons shooting all at once. after dodging they ALL need to reaload.
28-12-2018T16:56:08,sunblaze,thats why only 66% shoot the 33% left is for the others to reaload :D
28-12-2018T16:58:03,SageSaga,they staggered their shots
28-12-2018T16:58:38,Bgrmystr2,"in their defense, I don't think any amount of crossbow planning would have helped them"
28-12-2018T16:58:54,Bgrmystr2,"even if they had the best plan in the world, they still would have lost."
28-12-2018T17:00:30,sunblaze,well yes the idea of the behind the door ambush is pretty good against an obviously better enemy
28-12-2018T17:00:34,sunblaze,sadly bad execution :D
28-12-2018T17:01:15,sunblaze,now REAL execution follows
28-12-2018T17:01:19,Bgrmystr2,I don't think execution matters in this case lol.
28-12-2018T17:02:36,SageSaga,even if they had a second line to reload or to fire a second volley- she would have been in the room murdering before they aimed
28-12-2018T17:03:00,sunblaze,yes but they did not know that
28-12-2018T17:03:09,sunblaze,feared maybe :D
28-12-2018T17:03:28,Bgrmystr2,"yeah exactly, sage They're up against an enemy that no amount of planning on their part could defeat."
28-12-2018T17:03:30,SageSaga,also - thats all the crossbows they have
28-12-2018T17:03:43,sunblaze,ah ok that makes sense then
28-12-2018T17:03:46,SageSaga,and one of them is using a hand crossbow XD
28-12-2018T17:04:15,sunblaze,ah good I did not see that
28-12-2018T17:04:19,CrimsonQuill,"The problem with crossbows is that, once fired, all they are are complicated bits of machinery."
28-12-2018T17:04:25,sunblaze,yeas they threw their last desperate card
28-12-2018T17:04:30,sunblaze,sadly is was worthless :D
28-12-2018T17:04:31,CrimsonQuill,Bows at least can be easily swung...
28-12-2018T17:04:47,CrimsonQuill,"then again, since Nyna is a ninja-neko, it matters not."
28-12-2018T17:04:56,SageSaga,i think a crossbow makes for a better club than a bow does
28-12-2018T17:05:05,Bgrmystr2,"lol there's a reason crossbows have sharp tips and such on the front of it, and yeah"
28-12-2018T17:05:09,sunblaze,^that just club everything!
28-12-2018T17:05:12,Bgrmystr2,crossbows are heavier
28-12-2018T17:05:26,Bgrmystr2,plus they're much easier to load than a bow
28-12-2018T17:05:30,CrimsonQuill,There is ONE crossbow that could have stopped her.
28-12-2018T17:05:39,CrimsonQuill,"ALso, not easier to load than a bow actually"
28-12-2018T17:06:02,Bgrmystr2,you just put the arrow into the chamber for the most part. A bow requires the skill in knowing how to pull the arrow back and aim and such
28-12-2018T17:06:04,CrimsonQuill,"But anyway, there is something called, ""The Piece Maker""."
28-12-2018T17:06:08,sunblaze,they require time and time and precision. how is that easier then grabbing a new arrow?
28-12-2018T17:06:37,sunblaze,easier for the untrained yes that I agree
28-12-2018T17:06:45,SageSaga,grabbing arrows doesnt help with a crossbow
28-12-2018T17:06:58,CrimsonQuill,The Piece Maker could've stopped her..
28-12-2018T17:07:03,SageSaga,they just get destroyed
28-12-2018T17:07:28,CrimsonQuill,"But then again, it's a siege crossbow, fired by a troll, that sends a dozen bolts hurling at once in a cloud of destruction."
28-12-2018T17:07:37,Bgrmystr2,you don't need as much training for a crossbow. Just load and fire. in the direction of the enemy
28-12-2018T17:07:40,Bgrmystr2,they're fairly accurate
28-12-2018T17:07:56,CrimsonQuill,"When Sergeant Detritus misfired it, it demolished a wall in a cloud of splinters, leading to the following hilarious exchange:"
28-12-2018T17:07:57,sunblaze,the bolt variation or the flaming fireball ammunition?
28-12-2018T17:08:17,CrimsonQuill,@Sunblaze Bolt variation-splinters
28-12-2018T17:08:38,CrimsonQuill,"Vimes: ""Detritus, what have i told you about Mister Safety Catch?"""
28-12-2018T17:08:49,Bgrmystr2,I doubt any crossbow in the hands of them would have defeated nyna's calibur of monster
28-12-2018T17:09:04,CrimsonQuill,"Detritus: ""When Mister Safety Catch is not on, Mister Crossbow is not your friend."""
28-12-2018T17:09:08,SageSaga,dont think the Piecemaker could take out Nyna
28-12-2018T17:09:14,sunblaze,detrius is a rocktroll
28-12-2018T17:09:20,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga trust me, it could"
28-12-2018T17:09:21,sunblaze,she would not even hurt him
28-12-2018T17:09:38,SageSaga,trust me- it couldnt
28-12-2018T17:09:51,CrimsonQuill,"The only way to survive the Piecemaker is either be a golem, or be very, very far away."
28-12-2018T17:09:51,Bgrmystr2,"Quill, I don't think you understand how much power Nyna has"
28-12-2018T17:10:12,CrimsonQuill,"Bgrmystr, have you read Discworld, and what the Piecemaker can do?"
28-12-2018T17:10:36,CrimsonQuill,Think a 180 degree firing range of death.
28-12-2018T17:10:41,sunblaze,they have obviously then again detrius and his weapons are still mortal and do not use any magic
28-12-2018T17:10:57,SageSaga,its just a balista that a troll carries around
28-12-2018T17:10:59,sunblaze,I guess the scale just works waaaay different in a MMORPG-game
28-12-2018T17:11:15,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga you haven't read Discworld, have you?"
28-12-2018T17:11:21,SageSaga,I have
28-12-2018T17:11:29,CrimsonQuill,WAIT-YOU READ DISCWORLD!
28-12-2018T17:11:35,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, thank God."
28-12-2018T17:11:40,SageSaga,a long time ago
28-12-2018T17:11:46,CrimsonQuill,But you still think Detritus couldn't beat Nyna?
28-12-2018T17:11:54,SageSaga,not a chance
28-12-2018T17:11:59,CrimsonQuill,"He might be slow, but he could probably catch her in the Piecemaker"
28-12-2018T17:12:19,sunblaze,and fling her away?
28-12-2018T17:12:23,CrimsonQuill,"Failing that, either Captain Carrot (as long as he doesn't follow Marquis de Fantailer) or Sam Vimes."
28-12-2018T17:12:23,Twokinds,what detritus?
28-12-2018T17:12:23,sunblaze,now THAT sounds neat :D
28-12-2018T17:12:29,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•ó
28-12-2018T17:12:31,Bgrmystr2,lol Quill.. you should broaden your horizons. Just the description is enough to know whether it's capable of doing anything.
28-12-2018T17:12:32,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Discworld
28-12-2018T17:12:41,sunblaze,@tom rocktroll-guard from discworld
28-12-2018T17:12:42,CrimsonQuill,It's Terry pratchett
28-12-2018T17:12:44,Bgrmystr2,The rest of the story is not really relevant in that regard
28-12-2018T17:12:45,Twokinds,That's weird. That was one of the names I considered for the stone lizard.
28-12-2018T17:12:47,CrimsonQuill,Detritus is a troll
28-12-2018T17:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Ay Tom perfect timing
28-12-2018T17:12:53,Bgrmystr2,heya tom
28-12-2018T17:13:15,CrimsonQuill,He's a Troll Watchman in Anhk Morpork.
28-12-2018T17:13:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt mind me imma just sit here and eat n watch the bickering
28-12-2018T17:13:32,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, you need to read Discworld mate."
28-12-2018T17:13:35,sunblaze,he was a bouncer/guard before
28-12-2018T17:13:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Or ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù
28-12-2018T17:13:48,Twokinds,Well now I'm sad the name's already taken.
28-12-2018T17:13:55,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds It's ok
28-12-2018T17:14:10,Bgrmystr2,"I found the wiki about the crossbow, I don't need to read the whole series."
28-12-2018T17:14:11,CrimsonQuill,"You can think up anothr, surely"
28-12-2018T17:14:31,SageSaga,what screws Detritus is that even though the speed of the arrows he fires is ridiculous - Nyna is practically imnune to nonmagical weapons
28-12-2018T17:14:38,sunblaze,also we do not need a weapon to defeat Nyna.
28-12-2018T17:14:44,sunblaze,we have a fair elven maiden....
28-12-2018T17:14:49,sunblaze,ok maybe not fair :D
28-12-2018T17:14:49,SageSaga,immune*
28-12-2018T17:14:55,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, Nyna can't be hurt except by magic?"
28-12-2018T17:15:00,CrimsonQuill,hmmm...
28-12-2018T17:15:12,Bgrmystr2,Lol Quill you were so confident
28-12-2018T17:15:15,CrimsonQuill,I wonder what'd happen if she met Granny Weatherwax?
28-12-2018T17:15:24,sunblaze,√Æmplosion!
28-12-2018T17:15:28,CrimsonQuill,"I like Nyna, but I want a sense of her abilities."
28-12-2018T17:15:29,sunblaze,(also she is dead)
28-12-2018T17:15:33,SageSaga,Nyna is a high level Elite mob
28-12-2018T17:15:53,CrimsonQuill,How'd she stand up against Headology?
28-12-2018T17:16:06,CrimsonQuill,Given that there are probably ways into the head...
28-12-2018T17:16:18,sunblaze,mind contraol.
28-12-2018T17:16:20,Bgrmystr2,"That's why you need to expand your horizons, Quill. It's not difficult for me to gauge what she's capable of lol"
28-12-2018T17:16:23,sunblaze,hmmm interesting idea
28-12-2018T17:16:38,Bgrmystr2,plenty of RPGs and such
28-12-2018T17:16:53,CrimsonQuill,"I know that Nyna is a grade A badass, but I don't play much in the RPG genre"
28-12-2018T17:17:03,CrimsonQuill,"I do have Skyrim, but I've only started"
28-12-2018T17:17:16,SageSaga,Generally though I dont like comparing different fictions to my own- but a non-magical weapon vs Nyna is a nobrainer
28-12-2018T17:17:16,CrimsonQuill,The only 'Elites' I know are the ones from Halo.
28-12-2018T17:17:34,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, she wiped the floor of that entire room."
28-12-2018T17:17:42,SageSaga,so im not gonna get into all the ins and outs of Discworld vs Rune Aria
28-12-2018T17:18:35,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, good idea."
28-12-2018T17:18:35,SageSaga,Elite mobs in MMOs are creatures that even if they are the same level- are meant to be taken on my a party of people at that level- and are basically x4 stronger than a player of that level
28-12-2018T17:18:49,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs.
28-12-2018T17:18:55,Bgrmystr2,"Missed that part, huh"
28-12-2018T17:19:01,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
28-12-2018T17:19:20,CrimsonQuill,So how is Kaylin able to basically trump her without lifting a finger?
28-12-2018T17:19:32,SageSaga,Kaylin is a Max level adventurer
28-12-2018T17:19:33,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-scratch:
28-12-2018T17:19:36,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
28-12-2018T17:19:47,SageSaga,Kaylin is level 100
28-12-2018T17:19:51,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-uneasy:
28-12-2018T17:19:57,CrimsonQuill,Ok
28-12-2018T17:19:57,Bgrmystr2,"Nyna's what, level 90?"
28-12-2018T17:20:02,sunblaze,also the game favours players
28-12-2018T17:20:05,SageSaga,Nyna i think i said is 85
28-12-2018T17:20:09,CrimsonQuill,True....
28-12-2018T17:20:15,sunblaze,I seriously doubt that has changed espite their dissapearance
28-12-2018T17:20:27,Bgrmystr2,"Nyna's intention is to give endgame players a challenge, Quill"
28-12-2018T17:20:41,CrimsonQuill,That's interesting.
28-12-2018T17:20:42,SageSaga,there are still mobs in world that are level 120 and 100 elites and more
28-12-2018T17:20:49,CrimsonQuill,JEEPERS
28-12-2018T17:20:56,sunblaze,neat!
28-12-2018T17:21:04,sunblaze,I guess that dragon in the forest came close
28-12-2018T17:21:11,Bgrmystr2,yeah mmos get super scary at the high levels
28-12-2018T17:21:24,SageSaga,So Kaylin is godlike to most- but not top of the food chain
28-12-2018T17:21:24,Bgrmystr2,"well, RPGs, generally"
28-12-2018T17:21:30,SageSaga,and what dragon?
28-12-2018T17:21:40,sunblaze,oh right is was a giant wolf
28-12-2018T17:21:45,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga I read on TV tropes that your comic basically deconstructs the idea of an RPG world by seeing how people would actually live in it, and what would happen if the adventurers all went."
28-12-2018T17:21:46,sunblaze,sorry beer makes me dizzy :D
28-12-2018T17:22:07,SageSaga,my comic is on TV Tropes already?
28-12-2018T17:22:10,CrimsonQuill,Yep
28-12-2018T17:22:20,sunblaze,@quill yeah thats the point of the story :D
28-12-2018T17:22:23,CrimsonQuill,"One of my resolutions is to stay off TV tropes though,...."
28-12-2018T17:22:28,SageSaga,that is part of it
28-12-2018T17:22:33,CrimsonQuill,That site is eating my soul.
28-12-2018T17:22:36,Bgrmystr2,nothin's wrong with TV tropes
28-12-2018T17:22:45,CrimsonQuill,I spend too much time on it
28-12-2018T17:22:47,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot wrong with letting it control your time though
28-12-2018T17:23:03,CrimsonQuill,And get spoilers by accident for stuff I want to keep a surprise
28-12-2018T17:23:16,SageSaga,also - there are no toilets in the world
28-12-2018T17:23:32,CrimsonQuill,NO TOILETS? :ptv-RainbowThrowup::ptv-unimpressed:
28-12-2018T17:23:33,sunblaze,now you are getting nasty sage
28-12-2018T17:23:39,Bgrmystr2,"Also, yeah Sage's comic is in the same vein of RPG where once you get to max level, the game has only just begun."
28-12-2018T17:23:42,SageSaga,how is it nasty? XD
28-12-2018T17:24:22,SageSaga,"I have to double check my dialogue actually- several times ive had people yell stuff like ""OH CRAP!"" and im like ""Wait- there is no crap- i need to use a different expression"""
28-12-2018T17:24:36,Bgrmystr2,haha
28-12-2018T17:24:39,sunblaze,yeah I remember that
28-12-2018T17:24:40,CrimsonQuill,"I love the fact that TV tropes lets me think critically and objectively about stuff, but I have an overanalysis problem, and I just want a break from the tropes...."
28-12-2018T17:24:52,CrimsonQuill,I want to write down a few examples of them myself though.
28-12-2018T17:24:55,Bgrmystr2,you can't get a break from tropes
28-12-2018T17:25:01,sunblaze,but I still do not realy want to think about the reasoning for that.
28-12-2018T17:25:06,Bgrmystr2,"they are what make up the general happenings of life, bro"
28-12-2018T17:25:17,sunblaze,best guess they did not programm it. anything afte that is worse
28-12-2018T17:25:22,CrimsonQuill,"'Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds'. The 'Rule of Cool'"
28-12-2018T17:25:43,sunblaze,remindes me of DUNE and she moisture-reuse body suit......:ptv-RainbowThrowup:
28-12-2018T17:25:57,CrimsonQuill,There's a water reclaimation suit in Subnautica.
28-12-2018T17:26:19,CrimsonQuill,Mark kept making jokes about drinking his...reclaimed water in the game.
28-12-2018T17:26:25,SageSaga,cows on land improve the lands fertility as a buff- no poop!
28-12-2018T17:26:44,CrimsonQuill,I've had to shovel cow poo.
28-12-2018T17:26:48,CrimsonQuill,By the boxload.
28-12-2018T17:26:51,CrimsonQuill,IT REEKS.
28-12-2018T17:26:59,CrimsonQuill,Especially if the calves catch scour...
28-12-2018T17:27:02,sunblaze,be glad it was not chicken. thats worse
28-12-2018T17:27:10,CrimsonQuill,I'VE DONE THAT TOO.
28-12-2018T17:27:14,CrimsonQuill,And duck.
28-12-2018T17:27:27,CrimsonQuill,"Duck droppings, matted to the shavings...AAARRRGGGHHH"
28-12-2018T17:27:29,sunblaze,I feel sorry for you
28-12-2018T17:27:33,CrimsonQuill,Don't
28-12-2018T17:27:41,CrimsonQuill,Cyclops is a nice duck
28-12-2018T17:28:03,CrimsonQuill,He's a khaki campbell-muscovy cross...
28-12-2018T17:28:12,sunblaze,thats an awesome name for a duck :D
28-12-2018T17:28:28,CrimsonQuill,I named him Cyclops after I saw one of our cockerels gouge out his eye.
28-12-2018T17:28:52,CrimsonQuill,"As in, when i went out to check them, his eye socket was bleeding, and the cockerel had blood on his beak."
28-12-2018T17:28:56,CrimsonQuill,"Bye bye, cockerel."
28-12-2018T17:29:07,CrimsonQuill,*chop*
28-12-2018T17:29:20,CrimsonQuill,"But yeah, Cyclops is my favourite duck."
28-12-2018T17:29:27,CrimsonQuill,He's got the funniest quack
28-12-2018T17:29:37,CrimsonQuill,And his beak is covered in green algae
28-12-2018T17:30:05,sunblaze,did the cock went straight to the oven the next day?
28-12-2018T17:30:10,CrimsonQuill,No.
28-12-2018T17:30:13,CrimsonQuill,Too strngy
28-12-2018T17:30:15,sunblaze,awww :(
28-12-2018T17:30:17,CrimsonQuill,Just chopped
28-12-2018T17:30:23,sunblaze,or that ok :P
28-12-2018T17:30:27,CrimsonQuill,We don't really eat our dead poultry
28-12-2018T17:30:35,CrimsonQuill,We just bury or bin them
28-12-2018T17:30:36,sunblaze,just the eggs?
28-12-2018T17:30:39,CrimsonQuill,Eggs
28-12-2018T17:30:48,sunblaze,fair enough
28-12-2018T17:30:51,CrimsonQuill,Nick: 'Eggs from Heaven!'
28-12-2018T17:31:04,CrimsonQuill,Fetcher: 'No! From her bum!'
28-12-2018T17:31:23,CrimsonQuill,*Laughter as they cart away a box of eggs*
28-12-2018T17:31:40,CrimsonQuill,"That's a Chicken run quote, by the way."
28-12-2018T17:31:52,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, Sage, those bandits are nicely lit."
28-12-2018T17:32:08,sunblaze,next scene nicely dead :D
28-12-2018T17:32:18,CrimsonQuill,LOL
28-12-2018T17:35:03,CatzArt,I have returned! URAH!
28-12-2018T17:35:18,CrimsonQuill,OOH-RAH!
28-12-2018T17:35:32,CrimsonQuill,Get Tactical Marines!
28-12-2018T17:36:55,CatzArt,"Dear humanity, we regret being alien bastards, we regret coming to earth, and we most defienantly regret that the corps just blew up our raggedy ass fleet! URAH!"
28-12-2018T17:37:07,CrimsonQuill,"Haha, Halo references"
28-12-2018T17:37:16,CrimsonQuill,I finally got my Halo Kessah pic scanned
28-12-2018T17:37:29,CatzArt,I have all of sgt Johnson's lines memorized
28-12-2018T17:37:29,CrimsonQuill,Whether JonJoesco accepts it is his choic
28-12-2018T17:37:32,CrimsonQuill,choice
28-12-2018T17:37:45,CrimsonQuill,I have a lot of Johnson's lines memorized.
28-12-2018T17:38:00,CatzArt,He is the best space marine
28-12-2018T17:38:03,CrimsonQuill,But one of my persoal favourite exchanges is from 4...
28-12-2018T17:38:17,CrimsonQuill,"Del Rio: ""GIVE. ME. THAT. CHIP!"""
28-12-2018T17:38:28,CatzArt,i was just about to say that
28-12-2018T17:38:43,CrimsonQuill,"Master Chief: ""The Didact has to be stopped. If you won't do it, then I will."""
28-12-2018T17:38:57,CatzArt,I like to believe that when Master Chief says no he just crushes a Dorito chip into his visor
28-12-2018T17:39:08,CrimsonQuill,"Del Rio: ""I. Am ordering you. To SURRENDER THAT A.I!"""
28-12-2018T17:39:25,CrimsonQuill,"Master Chief: ""No, Sir."""
28-12-2018T17:39:40,CatzArt,Crushes chip into visor
28-12-2018T17:39:55,CrimsonQuill,"If 343 meant to establish Del Rio's incompetance once and for all, then they succeeded."
28-12-2018T17:40:09,CrimsonQuill,"And if it was a Dorito crisp, it'd have to be chilli."
28-12-2018T17:40:29,CrimsonQuill,We call them crisps as opposed to chips...
28-12-2018T17:40:40,CrimsonQuill,"And what you call fries, we call chips"
28-12-2018T17:40:45,CrimsonQuill,"Confusing, isn't it?"
28-12-2018T17:40:52,CatzArt,"Me and my friend call Captain Del Rio ""Captain Del ritos"""
28-12-2018T17:40:52,SageSaga,which one- is the crazy one? hmmmm
28-12-2018T17:41:01,CrimsonQuill,I SEE THE CRAZY ONE.
28-12-2018T17:41:07,CrimsonQuill,Lock him in Aperture Science
28-12-2018T17:41:10,SageSaga,doesnt mater- they allll dead
28-12-2018T17:41:17,CrimsonQuill,See how he does against Deadly Neurotoxin
28-12-2018T17:41:36,CrimsonQuill,"They're about to become the immediete past members of the being alive club, uh-huh?"
28-12-2018T17:41:47,CatzArt,Dont the Brits also call cookies biscuts?
28-12-2018T17:42:01,CatzArt,or is it just a canadian thing
28-12-2018T17:42:09,CrimsonQuill,"Irish and English call them biscuits, yes."
28-12-2018T17:42:53,sunblaze,cookies..... :ptv-excited:
28-12-2018T17:42:58,CatzArt,I will admit that I tried Canadian Tim Tam biscuts and they are supierior to american cookies
28-12-2018T17:43:50,CrimsonQuill,We have some nice biscuits in the pantry...
28-12-2018T17:44:02,CrimsonQuill,And my younger sister can make Breton Gallettes
28-12-2018T17:44:06,CatzArt,I'm still working through all the sugar cookies I baked for Christmas.
28-12-2018T17:44:11,CrimsonQuill,Those are French Butter biscuits by the way
28-12-2018T17:44:36,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga this music is strangely appropriate to the scene, no?"
28-12-2018T17:44:39,sunblaze,yeah catz so many sweets.... is like wonderlands :D
28-12-2018T17:44:53,CrimsonQuill,Oh-iced chocolate biscuit cake
28-12-2018T17:45:04,CatzArt,kinda quill
28-12-2018T17:45:05,SageSaga,i need to make some no-flour no sugar peanut butter cookies
28-12-2018T17:45:20,CatzArt,like oatmeal cookies Sage?
28-12-2018T17:45:20,sunblaze,I hate peanut butter
28-12-2018T17:45:25,sunblaze,is it any good in cookies?
28-12-2018T17:45:28,CrimsonQuill,I love Peanut Butter
28-12-2018T17:45:40,SageSaga,peanut butter cookies are great
28-12-2018T17:45:53,CatzArt,my mother makes an epic molasses cookie.
28-12-2018T17:46:00,sunblaze,hmm maybe I'll try some then.
28-12-2018T17:46:04,CrimsonQuill,"Imagine-it's an anime scene, Nyna's eyes gleam, and THIS plays as she dodges the arrows, and DEMOLISHES the bandist."
28-12-2018T17:46:38,CrimsonQuill,Bandits
28-12-2018T17:47:10,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...I'll bet Nyna could dodge Battle Rifle Bullets
28-12-2018T17:47:24,CatzArt,I just watched a few episodes of Space Battleship Yamato 2199 or Starblazers 2199 here in america on funimations website. So if Sage wants to set Yosh in a space opera I'm game
28-12-2018T17:47:43,CrimsonQuill,I have SO MANY animes on a watch list
28-12-2018T17:47:54,CrimsonQuill,I finished Season 1 of Red vs Blue
28-12-2018T17:48:09,SageSaga,"the best part about this is she chose to dodge even though she could just let them hit her and keep walking towards them. Why dodge then? Practice, and she doesnt want holes in her clothes"
28-12-2018T17:48:20,CrimsonQuill,Niiiice.
28-12-2018T17:48:20,CatzArt,"Setting sail far across the galactic sea, setting our sights on alpha centauri!"
28-12-2018T17:48:44,CrimsonQuill,"Since New year's Day is Tuesday, I'm going to restart Red vs Blue then..."
28-12-2018T17:48:55,CrimsonQuill,Donut has an amazing throwing arm.
28-12-2018T17:49:14,Bgrmystr2,Worst throw ever. Of all time. ^
28-12-2018T17:49:22,CatzArt,Speaking of alpha centauri. I dislike drawing centaurs doing the construction lines for them hurt my brain
28-12-2018T17:49:54,CrimsonQuill,I've made a New Year Resolution that I'll make at least one proper drawing (not just a doodle) per week.
28-12-2018T17:50:00,sunblaze,^www but multiple legs.....
28-12-2018T17:50:02,CrimsonQuill,And upload it to my Deviantart.
28-12-2018T17:50:25,CrimsonQuill,"I'd link it, but it has my real name on it...not safe"
28-12-2018T17:50:25,CatzArt,SO Sage do you just use a darker tone to shade skin or something else?
28-12-2018T17:50:36,CrimsonQuill,Have to change that...
28-12-2018T17:51:16,CatzArt,I tried to make a new layer and use a brush with 50% opacity to shade but it just looked wrong
28-12-2018T17:51:54,SageSaga,I actually like to change the color and use multiple - i dont just use a darker shade of the same color because it looks flat
28-12-2018T17:52:07,SageSaga,i often use blues for night- purples for evening or mornings
28-12-2018T17:52:21,SageSaga,and daylights i use reds and browns
28-12-2018T17:52:28,CrimsonQuill,I use colouring pencils that break when I try to sharpen them
28-12-2018T17:53:07,CatzArt,"Quill if its one thing I leaned is that its okay to set goals but try not to burn yourself out. I made that mistake before. I got ya Sage, I'll have to try that, using blacks and greys works for me in traditional work but digital is such a different beast"
28-12-2018T17:53:25,CrimsonQuill,Thanks Catz
28-12-2018T17:53:58,CrimsonQuill,"In the unlikely event that I get myself an XBOX one, is it worth linking it to a laptop, or only worth playing it on the television screen?"
28-12-2018T17:54:38,CatzArt,trust me Quill I got fustrated and quit art for 4 years and have been clawing myself back into it for awhile. I never heard of linking it to a laptop. I prefer a tv myself
28-12-2018T17:55:03,CrimsonQuill,That'd mean a Halo session about once a fortnight...
28-12-2018T17:55:08,CrimsonQuill,hmm...
28-12-2018T17:55:21,CrimsonQuill,Or buying a PC monitor
28-12-2018T17:56:17,CatzArt,I dont know if Britain has black friday or not but you can get a small tv for pretty cheap and it will still be bigger than a laptop screen
28-12-2018T17:56:35,Bgrmystr2,"I'd rather just get a large pc monitor to play console games on, but nowadays TVs are advanced enough where there's barely any difference."
28-12-2018T17:56:43,SageSaga,i dont generally recommend TVs as computer monitors
28-12-2018T17:56:56,CrimsonQuill,I just want to try out Warzone...
28-12-2018T17:57:08,CrimsonQuill,And those infamous Halo 2 Jackal Snipers
28-12-2018T17:57:58,Bgrmystr2,Most TVs are not great for reading text lol
28-12-2018T17:58:08,CatzArt,I just skip the first half of halo 2s second mission with an exploit to avoid them
28-12-2018T17:58:28,Bgrmystr2,"or you could just, yknow.. shoot them"
28-12-2018T17:58:31,Bgrmystr2,like everyone else does?
28-12-2018T17:58:35,CrimsonQuill,I tried to play the second hand Halo 3 on the 360. The disc is corrupted.
28-12-2018T17:59:24,CatzArt,well quill if you get an xbox one get the Master chief collection and you can play all the halo games except for 5 and reach
28-12-2018T17:59:36,CrimsonQuill,Yep
28-12-2018T17:59:43,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, Reach?"
28-12-2018T17:59:57,CrimsonQuill,"Well, it says that Reach is backwards compatible for the 1"
28-12-2018T18:00:05,Bgrmystr2,lol they didn't include reach?
28-12-2018T18:00:05,CatzArt,reach isnt on the MCC disc but the game is backwards compatible
28-12-2018T18:00:09,Bgrmystr2,that's silly
28-12-2018T18:00:15,CrimsonQuill,I'm bad at Reach
28-12-2018T18:00:19,CrimsonQuill,I keep rushing in...
28-12-2018T18:00:23,Bgrmystr2,it's not complete without reach
28-12-2018T18:00:32,CrimsonQuill,And then I get killed by Grunts...with fuel rods.
28-12-2018T18:00:33,Bgrmystr2,someone failed. lol
28-12-2018T18:00:48,CrimsonQuill,I have GOT to stop trying to be Rambo.
28-12-2018T18:01:00,Bgrmystr2,too many hours played on easy modo :v
28-12-2018T18:01:10,CrimsonQuill,I NEVER play easy.
28-12-2018T18:01:12,CrimsonQuill,Never.
28-12-2018T18:01:20,CatzArt,I just hide behind cover and pop out from time to time honestly odst is one of my favorites
28-12-2018T18:01:24,CrimsonQuill,"I started 4 on Normal, because it was completely new."
28-12-2018T18:01:27,Bgrmystr2,eh.
28-12-2018T18:01:37,CatzArt,Halo 4 is also the easiest halo game
28-12-2018T18:01:45,CrimsonQuill,But Reach..I startd straight in on the Heroic campaign.
28-12-2018T18:01:54,CrimsonQuill,I consider 4 to be my favourite story game.
28-12-2018T18:01:56,CatzArt,what eh? BGR? do you not like ODST?
28-12-2018T18:02:11,CrimsonQuill,And some of the gameplay is really good... in concept.
28-12-2018T18:02:14,Bgrmystr2,I didn't say anything about ODST. Where did that come from?
28-12-2018T18:02:42,CrimsonQuill,"Permission to link a video, Sage?"
28-12-2018T18:03:04,Bgrmystr2,doin it wrong 101 xD
28-12-2018T18:03:07,SageSaga,if you ask correctly
28-12-2018T18:03:14,CatzArt,nothing BGR sorry
28-12-2018T18:03:30,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga since we are talking about Halo, may I please link a music video I found relating to Halo?"
28-12-2018T18:03:31,Bgrmystr2,"lol, the eh wasn't even to you Catz xD"
28-12-2018T18:03:38,SageSaga,sure
28-12-2018T18:03:43,CrimsonQuill,Thank you
28-12-2018T18:03:51,CrimsonQuill,"Guys, this is a really good video."
28-12-2018T18:04:14,CrimsonQuill,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca2AxzFgac0&list=LL_sZELaZ5xtuUH6WMsRFX3w&index=2&t=0s
28-12-2018T18:04:27,Bgrmystr2,lol that timestamp tho
28-12-2018T18:04:30,CatzArt,halo 4 also has an issue with its guns having their ammunition and clip size cut in half so they kinda suck but beyond this halo 4 has good gunplay. Also the covinant AI is dreadfull
28-12-2018T18:05:04,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I lost track of how many times the GRUNTS of Reach outsmarted me, compared to 4."
28-12-2018T18:05:21,CrimsonQuill,But the perma-sprint was a much needed addition.
28-12-2018T18:05:34,CatzArt,Heh Crimson have you seen the Bip Bap Bam halo trailer?
28-12-2018T18:05:38,CrimsonQuill,The video linked is a 'Legends Never Die' Halo tribute.

28-12-2018T18:25:29,CatzArt,Yes but I wanna draw myself as a closed species I've been perfecting over the past couple of years. making a ref for them is next on my to do list.
28-12-2018T18:25:56,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm....
28-12-2018T18:27:04,CatzArt,after that I might try using sketch up to build models of the various airships that I have come up with for that world. because you can never have enough air ships

28-12-2018T21:18:15,swedishkitsune,o/
28-12-2018T21:21:16,Nekonny,We got him a few more sets
28-12-2018T21:21:24,Nekonny,I was gonna go for another train
28-12-2018T21:21:34,FFrost,inb4 star destroyer.
28-12-2018T21:21:34,Nekonny,but decided against it
28-12-2018T21:21:38,Nekonny,too expensive
28-12-2018T21:21:44,Nekonny,hes only 5
28-12-2018T21:22:14,FFrost,"Aaah, yea maybe not. Unless you're training him into a lego monster."
28-12-2018T21:22:14,swedishkitsune,I understand
28-12-2018T21:22:24,kittyelfie,can't you buy bags full of lego on ebay?
28-12-2018T21:22:37,kittyelfie,Just wash it really well when it arrives
28-12-2018T21:23:59,swedishkitsune,"yep, but often it comes with a shitload of other stuff like trash, fake lego, other toys and whatnot"
28-12-2018T21:24:35,FFrost,And a lingering sense of feeling cheap.
28-12-2018T21:24:39,swedishkitsune,^
28-12-2018T21:25:13,swedishkitsune,"on ebay, I only buy lego from German or Dutch sellers. never any other nationality"
28-12-2018T21:25:18,swedishkitsune,especially not british

28-12-2018T21:25:38,swedishkitsune,sorry but its the truth. Brits have a long tradition of smoking indoors
28-12-2018T21:25:55,swedishkitsune,that affects the lego in many cases
28-12-2018T21:26:12,FFrost,"Yay, oil!"
28-12-2018T21:27:22,Nekonny,"besides, you have to wash it all by hand"
28-12-2018T21:27:39,Nekonny,I probably need to do a feww trips to pick-a-brick
28-12-2018T21:27:56,BadFoMo,"Yo. Also, what did I miss?"
28-12-2018T21:28:01,RimaDraws,back
28-12-2018T21:28:53,Nekonny,wb
28-12-2018T21:28:59,Nekonny,"ok, what about the other outfit..."
28-12-2018T21:29:00,swedishkitsune,best way to buy used lego? bricklink or local afol fb salegroups
28-12-2018T21:29:06,swedishkitsune,open shirt?
28-12-2018T21:29:13,swedishkitsune,bikeshorts?
28-12-2018T21:29:23,Flake,crop tanktop and sport shorts
28-12-2018T21:30:47,Nekonny,perhaps yeah
28-12-2018T21:31:07,Nekonny,bricklink can do bulk lego?
28-12-2018T21:31:17,Nekonny,I need some basic blocks in large quantities
28-12-2018T21:31:29,Nekonny,"8's, 4's, 2's..."
28-12-2018T21:35:21,swedishkitsune,sure
28-12-2018T21:40:09,Nekonny,I'll have to look into that then
28-12-2018T21:40:41,Nekonny,"I wanted to get him some basic blocks... he has too many detail peices, but not enuogh bricks to actually "" build""  something"
28-12-2018T21:42:37,swedishkitsune,"those packs works good, you can often find them cheaper online at bricklink"
28-12-2018T21:44:05,Nekonny,the same pack or an assortment with the same bricks?
28-12-2018T21:44:43,swedishkitsune,same pack
28-12-2018T21:44:54,swedishkitsune,show me the pic again so I can see the set number
28-12-2018T21:46:14,swedishkitsune,you live in Florida right?
28-12-2018T21:46:24,Nekonny,yeha
28-12-2018T21:48:41,Nekonny,its an older set though?
28-12-2018T21:50:00,swedishkitsune,ye
28-12-2018T21:50:13,BadFoMo,Only 4 numbers; I'd say it's an older set.
28-12-2018T21:51:12,FFrost,"It's an older code sir, but it checks out."
28-12-2018T21:52:07,swedishkitsune,"the newer brick sets contains special parts also, I can check around to see if any good pure block sets still exists for a good price"
28-12-2018T21:52:35,Nekonny,I used to have this set
28-12-2018T21:52:48,BadFoMo,Cool!
28-12-2018T21:55:41,Nekonny,they were a seriesof sets from the 1970's that I inherited from an older cousin
28-12-2018T21:59:59,swedishkitsune,some of those were rereleased last year
28-12-2018T22:01:51,swedishkitsune,"welp, the best suggestion I have, is to buy the 1600 pieces box from legostore online, it costs 60 dollars. it has many blocks but also modern pieces."
28-12-2018T22:02:09,AndroxDraws,Ah hiya all
28-12-2018T22:02:15,swedishkitsune,its the best price/quantity equatiion suitable for your cousin

28-12-2018T22:08:18,Nekonny,that doesnt need multicolor

28-12-2018T22:18:52,swedishkitsune,in those colors also?
28-12-2018T22:19:01,Nekonny,that should be enough to build things like buildings and such

28-12-2018T22:19:20,Nekonny,and yellow

28-12-2018T22:19:43,Nekonny,yeah
28-12-2018T22:19:56,swedishkitsune,that might be a bit harder.
28-12-2018T22:20:01,Nekonny,every other brick I consider a detail brick
28-12-2018T22:20:24,swedishkitsune,I can see if I can find them in one seller for you. give me like 30 minutes
28-12-2018T22:20:35,Nekonny,"sure thing, thanks for all the help!"
28-12-2018T22:20:44,Nekonny,how many parts is that...
28-12-2018T22:20:48,BadFoMo,"A pit more costly, but maybe try Pick-A-Brick?"

28-12-2018T22:21:46,Nekonny,thats 1000 bricks even
28-12-2018T22:22:06,swedishkitsune,I bet like 200 dollars for such an order

28-12-2018T22:37:38,AndroxDraws,"It is, especially for someone who drew in a notebook constantly, it doesn't feel the same migrating to a tablet xP"
