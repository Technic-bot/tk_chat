19-01-2018T00:18:05,ZRO4825,FMA is also damned good
19-01-2018T00:18:09,SageSaga,then when he couldnt steal anymore without getting caught he made one of the stupidest villians
19-01-2018T00:18:12,unsteddyphoenix,Writer is a hack who stole an amazing premise and made it awful
19-01-2018T00:18:14,SageSaga,sir rapesalot
19-01-2018T00:18:15,Whitestripes,But really long
19-01-2018T00:18:33,Serpentfrog,But does he rape more than he saves?
19-01-2018T00:18:34,unsteddyphoenix,Biggest disappointment 2014
19-01-2018T00:18:34,RedDeath2018,Anyone play kingdom hearts
19-01-2018T00:18:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no
19-01-2018T00:18:43,ZombieKiller45,no
19-01-2018T00:18:46,Whitestripes,No
19-01-2018T00:18:52,MrRetroRealm,"To be honest, Sword Art Online would've been over in one episode if law enforcement got involved. But that's my opinion, I couldn't finish the first episode."
19-01-2018T00:19:17,unsteddyphoenix,Cops couldnt get involved dude was holding them all hostage
19-01-2018T00:19:17,Whitestripes,"Eh, I still enjoyed it"
19-01-2018T00:19:19,RedDeath2018,Kingdom hearts is amazing
19-01-2018T00:19:21,ZRO4825,Uh...you probably didn't actually catch WHY law enforcement couldn't jjust get involved...
19-01-2018T00:19:39,Whitestripes,Cause they're brains would have fried
19-01-2018T00:19:47,MrRetroRealm,Good point
19-01-2018T00:20:00,MrRetroRealm,But that anime didn't sit with me well
19-01-2018T00:20:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah it was just, really bad."
19-01-2018T00:20:16,Zakuru,glowing booty
19-01-2018T00:20:17,ZRO4825,Not to mention (spoilers) the guy they would've had to arrest was already buried into the game himself.
19-01-2018T00:20:19,Serpentfrog,"So the reason I don’t watch anime, White?"
19-01-2018T00:20:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Praise the Booty \[T]/
19-01-2018T00:20:31,ZRO4825,\[T]/
19-01-2018T00:20:52,ZRO4825,"Marv always helps me praise the Toyoko. Therefore, I shall help praise the Booty."
19-01-2018T00:21:00,Whitestripes,"You talking to me, serp?"
19-01-2018T00:21:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\[T]/
19-01-2018T00:21:06,Serpentfrog,Yes.
19-01-2018T00:21:15,RedDeath2018,If it were up to u the butt would be as big as the Eiffel tower
19-01-2018T00:21:30,Ordithus,AI begins \o/
19-01-2018T00:21:34,ZRO4825,"I'm a booby man, not a booty man. I like my women like Toyoko. :3"
19-01-2018T00:21:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,only the Eiffel tower
19-01-2018T00:21:51,unsteddyphoenix,Weird thing to pick for size.
19-01-2018T00:22:03,Whitestripes,The other anime I liked was Death Note
19-01-2018T00:22:08,RedDeath2018,Listen I’m texting as I think ok
19-01-2018T00:22:10,Endymion,"I made the mistake of watching Made in Abyss. Ranks up there with Graveyard of the Fireflies or Now and Then, Here and There as anime series I can't watch again because they make me hurt so much."
19-01-2018T00:22:14,Whitestripes,"But then again, I havemt watched a lot of anime"
19-01-2018T00:22:23,unsteddyphoenix,deathnote :100:

19-01-2018T00:22:49,MrRetroRealm,"I prefer One Punch Man, Dragon Ball Super, and My Hero Academia"
19-01-2018T00:22:51,ZRO4825,":thinking: I'll also accept Kate, Blue, Nami, Michelle, Kaylin, Fire Magi chick who's name is COMPLETELY gone from my head atm even though I've had sketches of her done...."
19-01-2018T00:22:52,SageSaga,you should all watch ERASED
19-01-2018T00:22:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and Firefly

19-01-2018T00:23:32,ZRO4825,One Punch Man is COMPLETELY worth watching.
19-01-2018T00:23:35,Whitestripes,Off*
19-01-2018T00:23:38,ZRO4825,"Also, the intro song is kickass"
19-01-2018T00:23:43,MrRetroRealm,"When you thought and anime with an overpowered character of such astronomical proportions would be boring, One Punch Man proves you wrong"
19-01-2018T00:23:58,Bgrmystr2,"huh, it's not there in my list, sec putting it there"
19-01-2018T00:24:02,Serpentfrog,Mary Sue the musical.
19-01-2018T00:24:04,ZRO4825,There's a guy on youtube did an English cover of One Punch Man's opening theme that is actually damned awesome
19-01-2018T00:24:05,Whitestripes,"Yeah, ive seen clips of it, and it looked badass"
19-01-2018T00:24:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"nate sharp, Zro?"

19-01-2018T00:24:41,Ordithus,Saitama is the best hero money can't buy... until season 2 probably
19-01-2018T00:25:14,Bgrmystr2,"There we go, got Erased on my watch list now."
19-01-2018T00:25:27,RedDeath2018,Are y’all gonna watch on sunday
19-01-2018T00:25:28,Bgrmystr2,"was on the watch later list, had to fix that"
19-01-2018T00:25:33,Endymion,I like the English covers of Gravity wall from Re: CREATORS and Here from The Ancient Magus' Bride.
19-01-2018T00:25:45,Zakuru,DID SOMEONE SAY ELIAS!?
19-01-2018T00:25:54,Endymion,Hehe.
19-01-2018T00:25:55,Bgrmystr2,Gravity Wall was an awesome song.

19-01-2018T00:26:15,Whitestripes,I have only heard an anime english dubbed theme song once. It was from DN angel
19-01-2018T00:26:29,Bgrmystr2,"Personally, I like Sh0ut more"
19-01-2018T00:26:32,Whitestripes,"I haven't even seen that, but the theme is great"
19-01-2018T00:26:44,Bgrmystr2,Sh0ut had a mix of Japanese and English
19-01-2018T00:26:52,Bgrmystr2,and it was my favorite theme of that anime
19-01-2018T00:27:12,Whitestripes,"Yeah, sometimes i feel like anime intros sound too similar"
19-01-2018T00:27:47,Bgrmystr2,"what are we supposed to be watching on Sunday, Red?"
19-01-2018T00:27:49,ZRO4825,"I enjoy the sound of most of them. Though, that being said, I enjoy the music in the Naruto series a lot. Don't hear much else like it that I've come across myself."
19-01-2018T00:28:01,Ordithus,Foo Fighters?
19-01-2018T00:28:27,Whitestripes,Naruto has great and memorable music

19-01-2018T00:28:59,ZRO4825,"Technically, no, it is not, but, it DOES have the sexy no jutsu, I forgot about that, lol"

19-01-2018T00:29:45,Whitestripes,I thought Naruto was TV-PG
19-01-2018T00:29:46,RedDeath2018,"Tom, do you watch anime"
19-01-2018T00:29:52,ZRO4825,"No, really Ordithus? You don't say? :P"

19-01-2018T00:30:09,unsteddyphoenix,"It is, girls can be totally nekkid as long as there's no nipples"
19-01-2018T00:30:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Just watch Gurren Lagann and all other anime becomes obsolete
19-01-2018T00:30:24,ZRO4825,I'm just saying she went from nothing noticeable to making all the other girls look flat. :joy:
19-01-2018T00:30:26,unsteddyphoenix,You know what anime actually has none of that? Dragon ball z
19-01-2018T00:30:27,Endymion,Is it permissible to put a link in here for a few songs?
19-01-2018T00:30:39,Whitestripes,Dragon ball Z is a classic
19-01-2018T00:30:45,ZRO4825,"Unsteddy has a point there. 'bout the closest you get to anything sexual in DBZ is Bulma, lol"
19-01-2018T00:30:50,MrRetroRealm,If I even dared to draw this well I'd be working on one image for days before raging lol
19-01-2018T00:30:53,unsteddyphoenix,"I'd debate, but I dont really want to carefully examine a 12 year olds tits"

19-01-2018T00:31:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and Goku booty
19-01-2018T00:31:28,ZRO4825,"Well, that was more Dragonball than Z, but yeah, lol"

19-01-2018T01:16:28,SageSaga,its better for you to learn realism and traditional art than it is to learn a particular style- that way you can develop your own style and adjust to do any style you want
19-01-2018T01:16:33,CrimsonHelsing,"Flora's gonna have an outburst, she'll wake the baby up, and then their relaxation time is gone for the rest of the night lol"

19-01-2018T01:48:37,unsteddyphoenix,Bad enough or good enough?
19-01-2018T01:48:58,Serpentfrog,Depends: are you a masochist?
19-01-2018T01:49:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,melted metal drops on your arms is not good imo
19-01-2018T01:49:21,MagicEnchilladas,unless it is mercury

19-01-2018T01:55:54,MagicEnchilladas,you could bring in the furry demographic with that though
19-01-2018T01:55:59,TheBeckoner,"They also don't fart, don't you think otherwise."
19-01-2018T01:56:06,TheBeckoner,okbye

19-01-2018T01:56:38,Serpentfrog,"No, only if you want quality."
19-01-2018T01:56:39,neropan,sagy i'll definetly ask for help later
19-01-2018T01:56:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, get the furry character in the manga, free readers"
19-01-2018T01:56:55,SageSaga,do character concepts first
19-01-2018T01:57:06,SageSaga,little sister and satan designs- and the MC
19-01-2018T01:57:07,unsteddyphoenix,^
19-01-2018T01:57:35,Serpentfrog,satan is a tsun. Girl likes ponies. Done.
19-01-2018T01:58:07,MagicEnchilladas,i thought that satan would be a yan-
19-01-2018T01:58:08,Kagiyama89,&lt;3
19-01-2018T01:58:20,MagicEnchilladas,ah well
19-01-2018T01:58:35,neropan,oh  had an idea
19-01-2018T01:58:39,SageSaga,if you wanna go serious- i recommend a story about how Satan has escaped earth and is hiding in the body of a young girl in an atheist families home
19-01-2018T01:59:07,sunblaze,hmm that sounds familliar. I think I read that as well
19-01-2018T01:59:21,SageSaga,"that way if you get the parents involved ever they can be like ""We dont believe in that garbage, stop making up dumb stories"""
19-01-2018T01:59:23,Serpentfrog,"This is religous discrimination, sage."
19-01-2018T02:00:05,MagicEnchilladas,"would be interesting, the MC has very little to do with the plot"
19-01-2018T02:00:10,neropan,sounds fun but i gotta make it sillier
19-01-2018T02:00:12,MagicEnchilladas,similar to Princess Mononoke
19-01-2018T02:00:17,Kagiyama89,idea!
19-01-2018T02:00:22,unsteddyphoenix,"""You believe evil is inside her? No scientologists in THIS house."""
19-01-2018T02:00:26,Kagiyama89,neropan's silly idea.. even sillier!? :ptv-ohmy:
19-01-2018T02:00:32,Serpentfrog,"""Christians always believe the devil s running amok comparatively and get the possessed girl help."""
19-01-2018T02:01:05,SageSaga,if the MC became a christian he would be bringing God into the house and inadvertently drive out his own sister
19-01-2018T02:01:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its about time she moved out
19-01-2018T02:01:37,Serpentfrog,Make it a Mormon family.
19-01-2018T02:01:42,MagicEnchilladas,God has to be MC childhood friend
19-01-2018T02:01:50,unsteddyphoenix,The little sister is too innocent and meek so when satan takes her over it's actually positive character development
19-01-2018T02:01:56,SageSaga,and he would have to rebuke god for the incest scene- because anime
19-01-2018T02:02:00,unsteddyphoenix,"""That little girl needs satan"""
19-01-2018T02:02:21,sunblaze,because anime indeed sage.....
19-01-2018T02:02:37,SageSaga,maybe the little sister was depressed and was going to kill herself when Satan took over her body
19-01-2018T02:02:38,neropan,wut
19-01-2018T02:02:49,Serpentfrog,Every character is a Mary Sue ecause anime.
19-01-2018T02:03:01,SageSaga,poor definition of Mary Sue then
19-01-2018T02:03:03,sunblaze,^wrong
19-01-2018T02:03:12,sunblaze,some are double and tripple MS :P
19-01-2018T02:03:15,MagicEnchilladas,or even darker Satan took the body afterwards because she wasnt using it
19-01-2018T02:03:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Oo, Satan saved her life, I like it"
19-01-2018T02:04:02,SageSaga,"""If i leave your sister now- she will just be a corpse"" *Pulls down collar showing marks from hanging herself*"
19-01-2018T02:04:20,unsteddyphoenix,Its getting a bit dokidoki in here
19-01-2018T02:04:29,Bgrmystr2,"you know, I dunno why Satan is the bad guy? He's the leader of hell right? He's in charge of punishing people who are supposed to be bad people, right? Wouldn't that make him a good guy?"
19-01-2018T02:04:34,Kagiyama89,Just
19-01-2018T02:04:34,Bgrmystr2,why do people make him out to be evil?
19-01-2018T02:04:36,Kagiyama89,Monika
19-01-2018T02:04:49,MagicEnchilladas,because Monika
19-01-2018T02:04:53,SageSaga,thats not actually his job
19-01-2018T02:04:58,Serpentfrog,"Made by he, despised by they. He's almost human."

19-01-2018T02:06:46,MagicEnchilladas,So is anyone from Hell trying to get Satan back to clean up the mess from when she/he left?

19-01-2018T02:45:19,SageSaga,i hunch over a tablet for hours at a time?
19-01-2018T02:47:13,Bgrmystr2,You should probably get something to attach your tablet to so you don't have to hunch over it
19-01-2018T02:48:10,SageSaga,if i could afford something maybe
19-01-2018T02:48:27,Bgrmystr2,:/
19-01-2018T02:49:06,Bgrmystr2,Does your tablet have attachment points like monitors do? I know they have those arm things you can swing monitors around so you can put them where they're convenient to see
19-01-2018T02:49:29,SageSaga,nah this tablet doesnt have that
19-01-2018T02:49:32,RedDeath2018,Dudes go to sleep it’s 1:49 am

19-01-2018T02:59:17,Bgrmystr2,considering there are FAR more people than the three of us who have been going to all the streams for far longer
19-01-2018T02:59:35,RedDeath2018,Fine
19-01-2018T02:59:56,RedDeath2018,This was fun though
19-01-2018T03:00:12,RedDeath2018,Especially when tom made flora derp
19-01-2018T03:00:54,TheBeckoner,"I'm usually always here. Haven't been for long, but I am."
19-01-2018T03:01:05,Bgrmystr2,I appreciate every derp tom gives us.

19-01-2018T03:03:12,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, this image is looking a bit dark"
19-01-2018T03:03:34,RedDeath2018,Thank you!!!!
19-01-2018T03:03:38,SageSaga,?
19-01-2018T03:03:44,MagicEnchilladas,its just a filter
19-01-2018T03:03:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,this is the thing he tried a little bit ago
19-01-2018T03:03:50,Bgrmystr2,it's like.. all grey
19-01-2018T03:03:57,SageSaga,. . .
19-01-2018T03:04:03,RedDeath2018,What
19-01-2018T03:04:16,Bgrmystr2,I don't remember the background being that dark
19-01-2018T03:04:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,grey tone RAVE!!!!!
19-01-2018T03:04:22,Bgrmystr2,Oh xD
19-01-2018T03:04:22,MagicEnchilladas,my eyes
19-01-2018T03:04:33,RedDeath2018,I don’t see a thing
19-01-2018T03:04:42,BadFoMo,Epelepcy!
19-01-2018T03:04:46,SageSaga,i added the grey because the brightness was hurting my head- i had something going on today
19-01-2018T03:04:52,Bgrmystr2,ahh okay
19-01-2018T03:04:54,Bgrmystr2,that makes sense
19-01-2018T03:04:58,BadFoMo,...Or however you spell that.
19-01-2018T03:05:09,RedDeath2018,Where is everyone popping up
19-01-2018T03:05:14,Bgrmystr2,It's seemed off for such a long time and I couldn't put my finger on why
19-01-2018T03:06:09,SageSaga,i was getting a migraine from the bright white so i made it grey to lessen it
19-01-2018T03:06:18,Bgrmystr2,did it help?
19-01-2018T03:06:20,RedDeath2018,Oh
19-01-2018T03:06:26,SageSaga,yes
19-01-2018T03:06:33,Bgrmystr2,"ah, good"

19-01-2018T03:07:07,MagicEnchilladas,night red
19-01-2018T03:07:10,MagicEnchilladas,again
19-01-2018T03:07:32,TheFDdriver,I missed the stream
19-01-2018T03:08:13,Bgrmystr2,well.. that does happen
19-01-2018T03:08:37,TheFDdriver,yeah but in a awkward way
19-01-2018T03:08:57,SageSaga,the stream is still goin'
19-01-2018T03:09:23,TheFDdriver,well thats true
19-01-2018T03:09:40,TheFDdriver,but i wanted to see it completely
19-01-2018T03:11:58,SageSaga,i think mine is recording- and Tom's should be recorded- Neros - doesnt get recorded unfortunately - not sure about Ron
19-01-2018T03:12:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ron does not record
19-01-2018T03:12:28,SageSaga,that son of a mother
19-01-2018T03:12:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
19-01-2018T03:12:48,TheFDdriver,xd
19-01-2018T03:13:23,Bgrmystr2,"Ron can't record, he doesn't have Premium"
19-01-2018T03:13:25,Bgrmystr2,last I saw
19-01-2018T03:13:38,SageSaga,he used to
19-01-2018T03:14:00,SageSaga,and he often recorded his work on his pc when streaming but he doesnt usually do that with his comic work
19-01-2018T03:14:08,Bgrmystr2,"just checked, he doesn't."
19-01-2018T03:14:14,Bgrmystr2,no Premium badge
19-01-2018T03:14:44,SageSaga,he used to record with OBS
19-01-2018T03:14:47,TheFDdriver,"XD, I thought that mean popular"
19-01-2018T03:15:01,Bgrmystr2,The Premium badge is for memberships
19-01-2018T03:15:17,Bgrmystr2,you get extra stuff like the animated gifs that people can post
19-01-2018T03:15:31,Bgrmystr2,ability to record your streams
19-01-2018T03:15:37,SageSaga,:csagesaga-c1::csagesaga-c2::csagesaga-c3::csagesaga-c4:
19-01-2018T03:15:42,Bgrmystr2,"remove ads from your and other people's streams, etc etc"
19-01-2018T03:15:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
19-01-2018T03:16:05,Bgrmystr2,"it all depends on what badge you pay for, for what you get"
19-01-2018T03:16:08,TheFDdriver,thats noice
19-01-2018T03:16:26,Bgrmystr2,"yeah there's more than that, but it's all a bunch of nice stuff"
19-01-2018T03:16:32,BadFoMo,Why are the Floras out of sink?
19-01-2018T03:16:43,SageSaga,different sources
19-01-2018T03:16:44,Bgrmystr2,"not all useful for everyone, but everything is useful to at least someone"
19-01-2018T03:17:03,Bgrmystr2,the floras wouldn't even be in sync even if they were both from tom's stream
19-01-2018T03:17:13,SageSaga,yeah they would
19-01-2018T03:17:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
19-01-2018T03:17:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
19-01-2018T03:17:21,BadFoMo,One of them is a fake!
19-01-2018T03:17:26,Bgrmystr2,"cuz the picarto servers don't always send the data to user computers at the same time. and no, they don't always sync"
19-01-2018T03:17:34,TheFDdriver,yep
19-01-2018T03:17:40,SageSaga,they do sync if they are the same source
19-01-2018T03:17:52,Bgrmystr2,cuz I see people posting stuff from tom's stream and they don't always sync.
19-01-2018T03:18:01,SageSaga,because its a cache file
19-01-2018T03:18:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its always synced on my end
19-01-2018T03:18:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah you're the one sending em xD
19-01-2018T03:18:46,SageSaga,those are synced perfectly for me
19-01-2018T03:18:54,SageSaga,and were sent at different times
19-01-2018T03:19:20,SageSaga,its almost like its just showing the same image cached on the system...
19-01-2018T03:20:46,Bgrmystr2,"so, what, I guess I just didn't happen to see unsynced images? xD"
19-01-2018T03:21:56,SageSaga,maybe you were seeing 2 different versions loaded or maybe you are thinking of what you see on Toms stream which can have FPS drops or the whole delay thing
19-01-2018T03:22:28,SageSaga,or maybe the file on the server got resent from another server because it got overloaded and you got a second cached file
19-01-2018T03:22:49,SageSaga,or maybe you are crazy and seeing things
19-01-2018T03:22:55,Bgrmystr2,"No, I'm thinking of the chat itself in the stream. from the same person even. I've seen people posting the nibbly trains, and they're not always in sync"
19-01-2018T03:23:06,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes they are, sometimes they aren't"
19-01-2018T03:23:27,SageSaga,some of those are from people who copied or changed them
19-01-2018T03:23:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'v always seen the nib trains in sync
19-01-2018T03:23:55,Bgrmystr2,the only person I know of that changes images is neon xD
19-01-2018T03:24:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and qwe
19-01-2018T03:24:06,Bgrmystr2,yeah and Qwe
19-01-2018T03:24:13,Bgrmystr2,he makes the big ones
19-01-2018T03:24:22,Bgrmystr2,but those are all different
19-01-2018T03:24:44,Bgrmystr2,"but I've seen messages with the same gif multiple times, and they aren't always in sync"
19-01-2018T03:25:07,SageSaga,maybe you are remembering incorrectly
19-01-2018T03:25:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they are in sync for me
19-01-2018T03:25:36,Bgrmystr2,"possible, but it happens so often that I'm doubtful of that"
19-01-2018T03:26:04,SageSaga,im doubtful of you so its ok
19-01-2018T03:26:08,Bgrmystr2,it's probably some server-client lag or web browser wizardry bug that I don't know about
19-01-2018T03:26:39,TheBeckoner,It bean people doing it.
19-01-2018T03:26:40,SageSaga,well what are you using?
19-01-2018T03:26:51,SageSaga,please say netscape navigator
19-01-2018T03:26:57,Bgrmystr2,lolno
19-01-2018T03:27:15,Bgrmystr2,Firefox 64bit 56.0.2
19-01-2018T03:27:20,Bgrmystr2,I've never touched netscape
19-01-2018T03:27:28,SageSaga,but you dont use Chrome because google wants to touch you in private places
19-01-2018T03:27:37,Bgrmystr2,chrome can die in a hole :v
19-01-2018T03:27:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
19-01-2018T03:28:12,Bgrmystr2,also the fact that it looks horrible and the UI is impossible to find anything
19-01-2018T03:28:24,Bgrmystr2,makes it impossible*
19-01-2018T03:28:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you can change the ui
19-01-2018T03:28:34,SageSaga,yeah i know- its almost like the UI is - oh wait nm- its really easy for me to find everything
19-01-2018T03:29:09,Bgrmystr2,"I've looked at Chrome before, and it doesn't seem to have changed too much over the years"
19-01-2018T03:29:16,Bgrmystr2,"least, not the basic one"
19-01-2018T03:29:50,Bgrmystr2,Firefox's new UI is also terrible
19-01-2018T03:31:01,SageSaga,the cool thing about Chrome is if you have a problem with it - you google it - and for some reason in the next patch that thing is fixed- its like... they know...
19-01-2018T03:32:22,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-01-2018T03:32:26,SageSaga,"then when i go to google something and I forget what it is- i ask google what i was probably going to search for and its like ""Cute sexy catgirls? You seem to check that a lot"""
19-01-2018T03:32:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
19-01-2018T03:32:59,Bgrmystr2,"literally just click the bar, don't even type anything"
19-01-2018T03:33:10,Bgrmystr2,and it automatically fills
19-01-2018T03:33:23,Bgrmystr2,fills with things you never searched for too
19-01-2018T03:33:48,SageSaga,"i was talking to a friend and he was like ""They are doing a Batman vs Black Panther"" and i was like ""Black Panther wins, no contest"""
19-01-2018T03:34:05,Bgrmystr2,"the auto-fill google gives you for ""How to"" is amusing"
19-01-2018T03:34:10,Bgrmystr2,haven't done it in a while though
19-01-2018T03:34:26,SageSaga,"and he was like ""How?"" and i was like ""Batmans only super power is money, and Black Panther beats him there soundly"""
19-01-2018T03:34:53,Bgrmystr2,Doesn't he develop all the technology he uses on the suit himself?
19-01-2018T03:35:29,Bgrmystr2,that'd at least make him extremely smart
19-01-2018T03:35:39,SageSaga,"and he was like ""I doubt Black panther-"" and i was like ""I typed in Black panther- and it filled out ""Has more money than batman"""
19-01-2018T03:36:00,Bgrmystr2,xD ^
19-01-2018T03:36:10,SageSaga,black panther is worth over 500 billion - Bruce Wayne is worth 80 Billion

19-01-2018T03:37:16,SageSaga,also having the most valuable material on earth with near limitless potential helps

19-01-2018T03:38:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it can even make James Spader into a robot

19-01-2018T03:38:49,SageSaga,sleep well

19-01-2018T03:38:59,Bgrmystr2,"brb, gotta grab some food"
19-01-2018T03:39:04,Bgrmystr2,gnight FD
19-01-2018T03:39:31,BadFoMo,Good night.
19-01-2018T03:39:36,SageSaga,btw- new animes coming out-
19-01-2018T03:39:43,SageSaga,got one im keeping an eye on
19-01-2018T03:39:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,which one is that
19-01-2018T03:40:03,MagicEnchilladas,have a nice night everyone
19-01-2018T03:40:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Magic
19-01-2018T03:40:27,SageSaga,Death March to the Parallel World Rhasody
19-01-2018T03:40:39,SageSaga,"it's yet another ""In another world"" lit RPG story"
19-01-2018T03:41:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Lets hope this one is better then smartphone
19-01-2018T03:42:06,SageSaga,"i know a lot of people are like ""Ugh another one?"" but im like- ""There's limitless potential for stories in almost every setting- theres still stuff to be explored and done- lets just hope it does it well"""
19-01-2018T03:42:47,SageSaga,"so far- it looks good, not great- it is nothing special yet- but it has potential"
19-01-2018T03:43:24,ZRO4825,"I personally hate the ""Oh &lt;insert anime&gt; already used that plot"" when really, the actual plot you use when boiled down to absolute basics, is unimportant. What really matters is how you present it."
19-01-2018T03:43:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'll check it out, see ing how dragon ball is taking a break this march, might need a new show to fill the void"
19-01-2018T03:43:57,ZRO4825,Oh? Super's taking a break for March?
19-01-2018T03:44:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
19-01-2018T03:44:06,SageSaga,if you want i can recommend a good anime to watch...
19-01-2018T03:44:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,shoot
19-01-2018T03:44:31,BadFoMo,"This may sound dumb, but what is the ""In another world"" theme about?"
19-01-2018T03:44:54,SageSaga,have you read Artificial Incident?
19-01-2018T03:45:06,BadFoMo,"No, sorry."
19-01-2018T03:45:09,TheBeckoner,has a bagel
19-01-2018T03:45:35,SageSaga,dont need to apologize - if its not your thing thats fine
19-01-2018T03:45:46,SageSaga,"but AI is a ""LitRPG"" story"
19-01-2018T03:45:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@ZRO4825 133 is the last super episode for 2018, then in April we're getting a movie based on the first sayain"
19-01-2018T03:46:32,SageSaga,LitRPGs are RPG literature- or a story about an RPG either just a game or people inside of a game or in another world like a game
19-01-2018T03:46:49,SageSaga,"while in another world is just a person from the ""real world"" in a different world"
19-01-2018T03:46:57,SageSaga,often like a fantasy RPG world
19-01-2018T03:47:19,TheBeckoner,i t s l i t m a n
19-01-2018T03:47:42,SageSaga,"this allows them to explore ideas like ""What if someone knowledgeable of fantasy tropes was suddenly in a world made of such tropes?"""
19-01-2018T03:47:57,TheBeckoner,I actually really like AI fwiw
19-01-2018T03:48:03,SageSaga,"or ""What if a scientist wound up in a fantasy world with magic but no gunpowder?"""
19-01-2018T03:48:18,ZRO4825,"Knight's & Magic actually somewhat explores that kind of idea, sage"
19-01-2018T03:48:26,SageSaga,"suddenly you have a guy creating guns for the ""lower class"" non magic people and they are wrecking mages"
19-01-2018T03:48:45,SageSaga,"yep Knights and Magic is also a ""in another world"" story"
19-01-2018T03:48:54,SageSaga,fun one too
19-01-2018T03:48:57,ZRO4825,I need more in that series &lt;3
19-01-2018T03:49:01,BadFoMo,"Ok, cool."
19-01-2018T03:49:30,SageSaga,"theres a ton of potential but some people hate it because of... SAO, and other less than interesting adaptations of such stories"
19-01-2018T03:49:36,SageSaga,Log Horizon is awesome
19-01-2018T03:49:52,SageSaga,Overlord- holycrap overlord- New season started too!
19-01-2018T03:50:01,SageSaga,So hype... err- anywho
19-01-2018T03:50:19,ZRO4825,Overlord! I need to look into the second season
19-01-2018T03:50:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same
19-01-2018T03:50:27,ZRO4825,First season was so great :joy:
19-01-2018T03:50:34,SageSaga,"unfortunately because of SAO's popularity the market got FLOODED with ""In another world"" stories"
19-01-2018T03:50:40,BadFoMo,The only part I can say I've seen is the Matrix and what little I've seen of .hack.
19-01-2018T03:50:52,ZRO4825,.Hack was &lt;3
19-01-2018T03:50:55,SageSaga,"and you got garbage like ""In another world with my Cell Phone"""
19-01-2018T03:51:29,SageSaga,that takes the awesome concept of having a powerful electronic device in a fantasy world! aaaaand turns it into Gary Sue garbage
19-01-2018T03:51:41,SageSaga,with no conflict
19-01-2018T03:52:09,BadFoMo,...And maybe the webcomic Dream Catcher.
19-01-2018T03:52:11,SageSaga,seriously the show has no conflict- everything is solved by overpowered magic and bull crap
19-01-2018T03:52:23,ZRO4825,"Ya know, now that you mention it, Dog Days was another ""another world"" concept deal"
19-01-2018T03:52:35,SageSaga,"""oh no im lost!"" *GOD LITERALLY GIVES HIM A MAP*"
19-01-2018T03:52:44,SageSaga,yes it was Zro
19-01-2018T03:53:05,ZRO4825,"I love Dog Days was more than I should, rewatched it 3 or 4 times now :joy:"
19-01-2018T03:53:18,SageSaga,I think i missed a season of Dog Days-
19-01-2018T03:53:24,ZRO4825,There were 3 total
19-01-2018T03:53:25,SageSaga,where do i watch that now anyways-
19-01-2018T03:53:30,SageSaga,yeah i think i only saw 1 and 2
19-01-2018T03:53:52,ZRO4825,"Season 1 and 2 were both on Crunchyroll, why they don't have 3 I have no clue, you have to find less legal places to see that season :("
19-01-2018T03:53:54,SageSaga,RECreator was actually good and terrible-
19-01-2018T03:54:27,SageSaga,RECreator does something i always wanted to do- which was a REVERSE IN ANOTHER WORLD STORY!
19-01-2018T03:54:49,SageSaga,rather than a character that goes to this other world- characters from other worlds come to earth!
19-01-2018T03:55:07,BadFoMo,I think I also had ideas for something like that for The Elder Scrolls where something from Fallout winds up in Nirn.
19-01-2018T03:55:09,ZRO4825,"Crunchyroll does some weird shit with seasons and series sometimes. Like Infinite Stratos, they don't hav ethe first season, only the second season, but the description doesn't mention that it's the second season AT ALL"
19-01-2018T03:55:39,SageSaga,its legit about Anime and Game characters that end up in the real world - and see us as Gods because we created them- but we are also so soft and squishy yet they are super powerful
19-01-2018T03:56:04,BadFoMo,Things like Pip-Boys are almost always broken when the Player gets to it though.
19-01-2018T03:56:40,SageSaga,a magic girl ends up wrecking a huge part of Tokyo- and terrified once she sees all the blood- because in her world that didnt happen- people didnt die when she used her magic...
19-01-2018T03:56:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah I really liked Re:Creators
19-01-2018T03:57:13,SageSaga,ITS AWESOME --- and then its not so great because they did a lot of needlessly complex things
19-01-2018T03:57:39,SageSaga,their whole explanation of things is so redundantly explained
19-01-2018T03:58:03,SageSaga,its like listening to people reading a car user manual in every language at the same time
19-01-2018T03:58:11,ZRO4825,"That sounds like me with the -gatari series. I enjoy watching it, but I hate how it wants to talk and talk and talk and talk."
19-01-2018T03:58:37,SageSaga,some anime like that are fine but lol- let me see what that is Zro - if its what i think it is-
19-01-2018T03:58:50,ZRO4825,Monogatari and such
19-01-2018T03:58:52,Bgrmystr2,The monogatari series
19-01-2018T03:58:56,Bgrmystr2,"damnit, beat me to it"
19-01-2018T03:59:04,BadFoMo,"They come to our world? //Troll Oh, you mean like Beast Master 2 and Masters on the Uneverse?"
19-01-2018T03:59:13,BadFoMo,*Universe
19-01-2018T03:59:21,BadFoMo,*OF
19-01-2018T03:59:30,ZRO4825,"Good series, what I've watched of it at least, but it likes to do these scenes where they just talk and talk and talk to the point where I'm going ""STFU ALREADY!!!"""
19-01-2018T03:59:38,ZRO4825,And I LIKE exposition!!
19-01-2018T03:59:45,Bgrmystr2,"Re:Creators didn't seem overtly complex, but yeah the explanations are a bit much. It's only because people who wouldn't understand the concept also watch the show and they didn't want to leave those people in the dust."
19-01-2018T03:59:58,SageSaga,omg Zro
19-01-2018T04:00:20,SageSaga,thats the one i was thinking of- its like Mountains of Text swirling by and it all doesnt make any sense in the first place
19-01-2018T04:00:34,SageSaga,but god- beautiful imagery
19-01-2018T04:00:54,Bgrmystr2,need to watch it
19-01-2018T04:00:55,SageSaga,it was how they described it all
19-01-2018T04:01:05,Bgrmystr2,"it's on my watch list, just never got around to it"
19-01-2018T04:01:11,SageSaga,i could easily have written it better- same thing- just easier to digest
19-01-2018T04:01:29,ZRO4825,"Yep, that would be the right show, lol"
19-01-2018T04:02:06,ZRO4825,And shit goes by so fast I have to pause the video to even read the entire screen to begin with
19-01-2018T04:02:20,SageSaga,exactly- its not Western Friendly
19-01-2018T04:02:21,ZRO4825,"Drives me up the wall, either stop throwing text AND speech at me, or slow down so I can absorb both FFS, lol"
19-01-2018T04:03:11,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, did you see uh.."
19-01-2018T04:03:12,Bgrmystr2,sec
19-01-2018T04:03:16,Bgrmystr2,"Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri"
19-01-2018T04:03:24,SageSaga,RECreators is much easier compared to that- but omg i wish they could have translated the Lie Twisted Upon Itself better
19-01-2018T04:03:31,SageSaga,GATE was great
19-01-2018T04:03:38,Bgrmystr2,I just recently watched it
19-01-2018T04:03:47,Bgrmystr2,on Wed and thurs
19-01-2018T04:04:09,SageSaga,must have been nice to be able to watch it all at once
19-01-2018T04:04:13,SageSaga,i waited week after week
19-01-2018T04:04:42,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, I just binged it. I kinda miss waiting for shows to have new episodes"
19-01-2018T04:04:59,SageSaga,waiting is over rated XD
19-01-2018T04:05:08,SageSaga,omg is the new Overlord out yet-
19-01-2018T04:05:42,SageSaga,baaaaah!!!
19-01-2018T04:05:45,SageSaga,Tuesday
19-01-2018T04:05:54,Bgrmystr2,"Imo, I'd RATHER watch it as soon as it comes out, but I feel that honestly, binge-watching the whole thing so you don't forget anything is generally the ideal experience."
19-01-2018T04:07:07,SageSaga,i get it takes time- seriously- i get it *finishes inking comic that doesnt go up till wednesday* but i still want it now :D
19-01-2018T04:07:16,BadFoMo,...Does Last Action Hero count as In another world and Revirse in another world?
19-01-2018T04:07:44,Bgrmystr2,"I wasn't sure what your opinion of Gate would have been. The story is great, but it feels, just like Smartphone, that the battles were won with relative ease. Completely demolished everything in their path, basically."
19-01-2018T04:08:00,SageSaga,. . . omg Last Action hero counts as in Another World
19-01-2018T04:08:01,Bgrmystr2,but I guess it wasn't presented in the same way
19-01-2018T04:08:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
19-01-2018T04:08:19,SageSaga,but Bgr- that made sense
19-01-2018T04:08:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah it did.
19-01-2018T04:08:37,Bgrmystr2,one of the reasons why I liked it
19-01-2018T04:09:05,SageSaga,"""oh no - they have spears and swords! What are we going to do?!"" ""We have Guns"" ""oh right- open fire"""
19-01-2018T04:09:17,BadFoMo,And then Danny brings Jack Slater back to his world to chase after Benadict.
19-01-2018T04:09:22,Bgrmystr2,Fucking.. helicopters with Ride of the Valkyries..
19-01-2018T04:09:29,SageSaga,exactly!
19-01-2018T04:09:32,Bgrmystr2,That was the greatest moment
19-01-2018T04:09:35,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-01-2018T04:09:39,ZRO4825,"lol, lookin at this page, I just remembered the comments from AI's page this past week. ""Oh this ship is gonna happen!"" and I'm thinking ""Uh...duh?"" lol"
19-01-2018T04:10:08,BadFoMo,"Uh, the guy with that glass eye!"
19-01-2018T04:10:30,SageSaga,"it's literally ""What if we attacked the roman armies with a modern army?"" ""Lets give them some drakes to make it a little more even"" ""Uhh- Sure- its still not even"""
19-01-2018T04:11:00,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-01-2018T04:11:19,Bgrmystr2,I told phoenix about it earlier in the stream
19-01-2018T04:11:34,BadFoMo,You mean thoes little Dragon things?
19-01-2018T04:11:41,Bgrmystr2,I can safely say it's SageApproved™
19-01-2018T04:11:44,SageSaga,"i mean they face off against an actual dragon - ""This dragon will lay waste to a kingdom"" ""Our squad chased it off"""
19-01-2018T04:13:25,SageSaga,"""We would like to negotiate for resources"" ""Ok do you have gold?"" ""How about we dont nuke you?"" ""What's a nuke?"" ""look out the window"" ""The city is gone..."" ""That was a nuke"""
19-01-2018T04:13:44,ZRO4825,lol
19-01-2018T04:13:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
19-01-2018T04:15:15,Bgrmystr2,"Hope they come out with Season 3, I guess"
19-01-2018T04:15:23,ZRO4825,Why do I only get the itch to art when I should be going to bed?
19-01-2018T04:15:26,SageSaga,its been a while
19-01-2018T04:15:52,Bgrmystr2,"Well zro, I imagine that in the future, when you art for a living"
19-01-2018T04:15:57,ZRO4825,:joy:
19-01-2018T04:15:59,Bgrmystr2,you'll be doing art streams in the middle of the night
19-01-2018T04:16:05,Bgrmystr2,like all the other artists
19-01-2018T04:16:05,ZRO4825,:rofl:
19-01-2018T04:16:09,Bgrmystr2,XD
19-01-2018T04:16:12,SageSaga,because your brain is interacting with your subconscious allowing you to pick up on concepts you dont normally think about and your awake brain is able to put them together
19-01-2018T04:16:13,BadFoMo,"//Troll Wait, if you Nuke their city, they may not be in the mood to negotiate."
19-01-2018T04:16:33,Bgrmystr2,"aw, sage ruins it with science"
19-01-2018T04:16:38,Bgrmystr2,"cool science, but science nonetheless."
19-01-2018T04:16:52,Bgrmystr2,"I was just gonna say ""It's a sign"""
19-01-2018T04:16:53,SageSaga,doesnt that make it more cool instead of ruined?
19-01-2018T04:16:55,ZRO4825,"yeah, but then by the time ideas get through my brain and out my hands, I'm too tired to do them right anyway :joy:"
19-01-2018T04:17:08,SageSaga,XD Bgr- i gotta find that comic-
19-01-2018T04:17:11,BadFoMo,It would be cheaper to just show the stock test fotage
19-01-2018T04:17:14,unsteddyphoenix,Or it's that you feel guilty about not drawing anything and you want to get something done before you go to sleep so you can avoid feeling like you completely wasted your time
19-01-2018T04:17:20,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, for me it would be less cool cuz that just kinda boils down to ""Yer brain is doing brain things. It's normal"""
19-01-2018T04:17:37,ZRO4825,But what if your brain doesn't normally do brain things?
19-01-2018T04:17:49,Bgrmystr2,That's when the magic happens :D
19-01-2018T04:17:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats the best time to draw
19-01-2018T04:17:55,Bgrmystr2,Exactly!
19-01-2018T04:18:14,Bgrmystr2,"one sec, gotta throw pizza in the oven"

19-01-2018T04:19:19,TheBeckoner,Why does facial hair have to itch...
19-01-2018T04:19:32,ZRO4825,If it didn't itch you wouldn't know it was there.
19-01-2018T04:20:10,TheBeckoner,Well that's what a mirror is for.

19-01-2018T15:28:37,BluePhantom90,"Lol Sage has a mico nuke aimed at Tom's place. ""Tom join or I nuke you! Your choice"" lol"

19-01-2018T15:28:58,Serpentfrog,"You're right, Sage. They only have a stop button."
19-01-2018T15:29:00,Russianconservative,Well guns make your friends do shit they don’t want to not that I ever pointed one at their face
19-01-2018T15:29:18,Russianconservative,Serpent is right
19-01-2018T15:29:34,SageSaga,people seem to think the only reason Tom would stream with me is if i threatened him T_T
19-01-2018T15:29:34,MrRetroRealm,Goodbye
19-01-2018T15:29:35,funnyman42,Hello Everyone!
19-01-2018T15:29:42,Mustanglvr007,Hey
19-01-2018T15:29:46,Serpentfrog,"Hey, Funny."
19-01-2018T15:29:51,NeonMitsumi,'ello
19-01-2018T15:30:02,Ordithus,:beer:
19-01-2018T15:31:28,AlphaAkuma,oh my for real sage
19-01-2018T15:31:40,BluePhantom90,Well I mean Sage you might have threaten Tom to kill off his D&D character or some character you guys do together or else lol
19-01-2018T15:32:10,Serpentfrog,I would think the killing off would be the or else.
19-01-2018T15:32:11,SageSaga,dont make up such silly things
19-01-2018T15:33:40,BluePhantom90,You all should do a live stream when playing D&D. I would watch lol
19-01-2018T15:33:53,MetalAppleSauce,I would too
19-01-2018T15:34:28,BluePhantom90,But secretly most of us would root for Tom.
19-01-2018T15:34:36,qwe304,adrias hair reminds me of ulysses
19-01-2018T15:34:45,Serpentfrog,Adria?
19-01-2018T15:34:46,MetalAppleSauce,Don't tell Sage that!
19-01-2018T15:35:03,Ordithus,D&D is cooperative tho
19-01-2018T15:35:04,SageSaga,you do know my job isnt to defeat Tom in any of the RPGs right?
19-01-2018T15:36:49,Serpentfrog,Inb4 this is an ad poster for the Riftwall.
19-01-2018T15:36:50,Ordithus,Job implies being paid.  You'd do it for funsies.
19-01-2018T15:36:59,BluePhantom90,I mean like cheer for Tom to get the best stuff and leave you guys in the dust. Had that happen to me once. T-T but I was lawfully good so I couldn't kill my friend for stealing the good stuff
19-01-2018T15:37:02,NeonMitsumi,I'd be down for more posters.
19-01-2018T15:37:04,Ordithus,:ptv-snicker:

19-01-2018T15:37:33,MetalAppleSauce,rood
19-01-2018T15:37:49,SageSaga,what holds back most characters in this game is the players
19-01-2018T15:38:06,Russianconservative,During the course of most of the stream I was writing things that popped into mind and realized I’m messed up
19-01-2018T15:38:14,SageSaga,they dont want to be creative or come up with things on their own- one of them wants to roll and have me tell everyone what cool thing he does
19-01-2018T15:38:16,BluePhantom90,What he was chaotic neutral. He stole stuff from everyone
19-01-2018T15:38:28,Serpentfrog,"It took you this long, Russian?"
19-01-2018T15:38:37,NeonMitsumi,gg
19-01-2018T15:38:55,Russianconservative,Very funny
19-01-2018T15:38:58,Russianconservative,But yes
19-01-2018T15:39:16,Russianconservative,Gotta erase some stuff hold on
19-01-2018T15:40:03,BluePhantom90,Like one game of D&D we were looking for a pet baby dragon for some random person. We walked into a Storage room which I told everyone lets look around. BUT NOPE and one guy almost got killed by the baby dragon
19-01-2018T15:41:45,BluePhantom90,It was in a Hobgoblin cave turned into a dungeon. The baby dragon was covered in hay that attack our friend. e-e
19-01-2018T15:42:14,Russianconservative,The fuck is D&D
19-01-2018T15:42:24,NeonMitsumi,Dunkin&Donuts
19-01-2018T15:42:42,Russianconservative,Oh... really? That’s boring
19-01-2018T15:42:45,MetalAppleSauce,Dungeons and Dumbasses
19-01-2018T15:42:45,BluePhantom90,Dungeon & Dragons! you never heard of it
19-01-2018T15:42:49,Russianconservative,No

19-01-2018T15:43:12,Russianconservative,Cards against humanity yes it’s right beside me
19-01-2018T15:43:14,Mustanglvr007,Dicks and Dongs
19-01-2018T15:43:15,BluePhantom90,then you have been living under a rock. its been around for like the 1970's I think

19-01-2018T16:32:18,CanisRufusUK,"The shorter lifespan is an issue, if I was Keidran I'd have been dead for 10+ years :P"
19-01-2018T16:32:40,Terramaster20209,I would be old by now if I would be a keidran

19-01-2018T16:39:25,Asalis,and that song had more than one game remixed into it. &gt;.&gt;;
19-01-2018T16:39:25,Bgrmystr2,"and exactly what it says on the tin, neon. Not always."
19-01-2018T16:39:31,Serpentfrog,He should find a way to convert it into power.
19-01-2018T16:39:41,NeonMitsumi,You're confusing me.
19-01-2018T16:39:43,Bgrmystr2,yeah serp
19-01-2018T16:39:50,Terramaster20209,ayy db refrence
19-01-2018T16:40:07,Bgrmystr2,"it's not difficult, Neon. you sometimes see ""remix"" attached to game titles."
19-01-2018T16:40:15,Bgrmystr2,not creator names
19-01-2018T16:40:21,Bgrmystr2,it's a very common thing
19-01-2018T16:40:30,Bgrmystr2,"both are, honestly"
19-01-2018T16:40:55,NeonMitsumi,I guess whatever gets you views and plays?
19-01-2018T16:41:42,Serpentfrog,The remix the movie the book the game.
19-01-2018T16:41:54,Zakuru,finito?
19-01-2018T16:41:54,MetalAppleSauce,You mean scott pilgrim?

19-01-2018T16:41:56,MintGreen,awwwww i saw the loading symbol for the first time. frickin adorable
19-01-2018T16:41:56,Bgrmystr2,The remix isn't based on the creator. The remix is based on what the song is from.
19-01-2018T16:42:23,NeonMitsumi,Original Artist - Title (Remix Artist)
19-01-2018T16:42:29,NeonMitsumi,That's how it should be.
19-01-2018T16:42:35,Bgrmystr2,"That's one way of doing it, yes lol"
19-01-2018T16:42:41,Serpentfrog,"Trust him, he's a musician."

19-01-2018T16:43:58,Terramaster20209,is there going to be a second drawing ?
19-01-2018T16:44:06,Bgrmystr2,I guess not making my own songs means I'm not a musician?
19-01-2018T16:44:12,Bgrmystr2,didn't know that's how it worked.
19-01-2018T16:44:35,Kamaro12,"I love this drawing, but I feel like adira's just gonna spill that mug right after XD"
19-01-2018T16:44:38,NeonMitsumi,What does that have to do with anything?
19-01-2018T16:44:41,SageSaga,I guess musicians are all known for conforming to one set way of doing things- its why all songs sound the same
19-01-2018T16:44:53,Bgrmystr2,obviously sage
19-01-2018T16:45:01,MisterWho,Normally beer foam goes down till the beer surface...but i won't complaing about the picture at all. :) *hides*

19-01-2018T17:10:24,Serpentfrog,Then you aren't cheating right. :P
19-01-2018T17:10:27,MetalAppleSauce,"""Don't talk to me or my daughter again"""

19-01-2018T17:10:57,SageSaga,"i need 9 clones and 20,000 dollars to get each of them tablets"
19-01-2018T17:11:22,Asalis,what do you need the clones for?
19-01-2018T17:11:40,SageSaga,to draw
19-01-2018T17:11:42,Tharkis,so sage can go to tahiti while the comics still get done =D
19-01-2018T17:11:46,Serpentfrog,S pine replacement.
19-01-2018T17:11:48,Twokinds,"Man, I wish I had clones too"
19-01-2018T17:11:50,Tharkis,(or other exotic location)

19-01-2018T17:12:03,Tharkis,is an identical twin
19-01-2018T17:12:03,MisterWho,Clones need feeding ;)
19-01-2018T17:12:10,CrimsonHelsing,Lol
19-01-2018T17:12:25,MetalAppleSauce,If tom had clones he would be able to have the nora card limit raised
19-01-2018T17:12:31,Twokinds,I would get so much work done.
19-01-2018T17:12:36,Serpentfrog,What you need are replicants.
19-01-2018T17:12:43,MetalAppleSauce,but then everything would be carded and there wouldn't be a point for the monthly vote
19-01-2018T17:12:46,Bgrmystr2,"Back to 2 comics a week, 3 probably."
19-01-2018T17:12:46,Ordithus,He could update the comic so much faster
19-01-2018T17:12:47,CanisRufusUK,"The big problem is when the clone want's a clone to do tings for it, then  the clone's clone want's a clone, and the clone's clone's clone asks for a clone..."

19-01-2018T17:12:59,Bgrmystr2,that's a lot
19-01-2018T17:13:07,Ordithus,Then the clones take over
19-01-2018T17:13:10,SageSaga,doing comics takes a lot of time
19-01-2018T17:13:23,NeonMitsumi,Doing good comics even longer
19-01-2018T17:13:24,Zakuru,spring rolls in the oven!

19-01-2018T17:51:29,SageSaga,same day as MHW
19-01-2018T17:51:47,BluePhantom90,Heard Dragon Ball super will end sometime soon. lol It just came back

19-01-2018T17:52:03,TheFDdriver,at episode 136

19-01-2018T17:52:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its taking a break after 133
19-01-2018T17:52:16,ZRO4825,"I heard it's taking a hiatus, not ending."
19-01-2018T17:52:32,TheFDdriver,then a Broly movie
19-01-2018T17:52:37,ZRO4825,"Which is fine, as long as it's not a Fairy Tail hiatus &lt;_&lt;;"
19-01-2018T17:52:46,SageSaga,we were talking about the game not DBS
19-01-2018T17:52:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"not a broly movie, its a movie on how that sayains came to be"
19-01-2018T17:53:12,TheFDdriver,my brother lied to me
19-01-2018T17:53:23,TheFDdriver,plus thats better

19-01-2018T17:53:58,TheFDdriver,i am good with tenkaishi 3
19-01-2018T17:53:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"same, not really into fighting games"
19-01-2018T17:54:22,ZRO4825,"I can't blame anyone for that. This one's actually a fighting  game with Dragonball elements, instead of a Dragonball game with fighting elements like 95% of them were before."
19-01-2018T17:54:25,BluePhantom90,btw Netflix has that Godzilla movie... which is kinda weird
19-01-2018T17:54:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and shin godzilla is normal?
19-01-2018T17:54:56,TheBeckoner,Someone was streaming a Godzilla movie early this morning lol

19-01-2018T18:00:42,SageSaga,(is that easy)
19-01-2018T18:00:43,BluePhantom90,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNn2FgQbsd8
19-01-2018T18:01:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Monster Planet was alright, had some cool moments"
19-01-2018T18:01:43,Ordithus,"Ah ha ha, autotranslated English is funnny"
19-01-2018T18:01:47,BluePhantom90,yeah. Just weird story
19-01-2018T18:01:57,sunblaze,oh those are some nice fire drawings
19-01-2018T18:02:03,sunblaze,maybe i'll watch that series
19-01-2018T18:02:08,SageSaga,see it is weird- they sent me a message about this being a series- not a movie
19-01-2018T18:02:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"not that weird really, Godzilla vs Megalon was weirder"
19-01-2018T18:02:28,TheFDdriver,yep
19-01-2018T18:02:30,BluePhantom90,It might be a Movie Series
19-01-2018T18:02:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like lord of the rings
19-01-2018T18:02:50,SageSaga,they said all episodes were available now
19-01-2018T18:02:55,BluePhantom90,because the end leaves you on a huge cliffhanger
19-01-2018T18:02:57,TheBeckoner,It looks pretty neat. (the trailer)
19-01-2018T18:02:58,Char89TheCharizard,"hey, just got on for a few minutes. Was there a reason why Tom streamed today?"
19-01-2018T18:03:13,SageSaga,because i asked him if he wanted to stream with me
19-01-2018T18:03:15,SageSaga,so he did
19-01-2018T18:03:17,BluePhantom90,No Sage just forced him
19-01-2018T18:03:25,BluePhantom90,lol
19-01-2018T18:03:33,TheFDdriver,why char?
19-01-2018T18:03:44,SageSaga,he will still be streaming Sunday
19-01-2018T18:03:48,Char89TheCharizard,just asking
19-01-2018T18:04:06,TheFDdriver,got confused
19-01-2018T18:04:56,ZRO4825,Sage drove to Tom's house and chained him to the tablet with a lock that only unlocks after a specific amount of time spent on stream with Sage. Obviously. :P
19-01-2018T18:05:01,Char89TheCharizard,I honestly assumed Tom would only stream on the days he scheduled himself in
19-01-2018T18:05:09,BluePhantom90,"&gt;-&lt; I don't want to spoil the end of the first movie but! It was really really weird and well scary.  Then after credits its "" oh great! love interest story next movie"""
19-01-2018T18:05:14,ZRO4825,"Nah, he occasionally streams at oddball times."
19-01-2018T18:05:15,Ordithus,Tom streams randomly quite a bit
19-01-2018T18:05:18,Bgrmystr2,"that's never been the case, Char"
19-01-2018T18:05:30,Bgrmystr2,and has been said that it wasn't many times when people ask xD
19-01-2018T18:05:38,SageSaga,"Tom is one of my best friends, so sometimes he'll just join me"
19-01-2018T18:05:47,Char89TheCharizard,Has Chu asked him before?
19-01-2018T18:05:59,SageSaga,who is Chu?
19-01-2018T18:06:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Chu is you
19-01-2018T18:06:13,Char89TheCharizard,"The creator of the webcomic, ""Slightly Damned"""
19-01-2018T18:06:18,Bgrmystr2,"no, it's spelled diffeently, marv lol"
19-01-2018T18:06:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thought he was speaking internet
19-01-2018T18:06:46,ZRO4825,Chuu is the noise in anime for kisses~
19-01-2018T18:06:51,ZRO4825,Don't you people know anything? D:
19-01-2018T18:06:56,Bgrmystr2,that question wouldn't have even made sense in that context anyway
19-01-2018T18:07:03,SageSaga,I dunno
19-01-2018T18:07:46,SageSaga,im not sure how im supposed to know if someone i dont know asked Tom something-
19-01-2018T18:08:02,Char89TheCharizard,"okay then. Well since he's not streaming, I best be on my way. I would've got on a lot sooner but I was busy play testing a build for Klace on his new visual novel, ""Winds of Change"""
19-01-2018T18:08:07,TheFDdriver,"well i am leaving, need to do some homework"
19-01-2018T18:08:21,Ordithus,"Bye Char, FD"
19-01-2018T18:08:26,Bgrmystr2,"gl, FD"
19-01-2018T18:08:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya FD
19-01-2018T18:08:49,TheFDdriver,3S
19-01-2018T18:08:50,SageSaga,why this guy be name dropping a bunch of people i dont know?
19-01-2018T18:09:10,Ordithus,shrugs
19-01-2018T18:09:27,Bgrmystr2,fuck if I know. :ptv-wondering:
19-01-2018T18:09:36,TheFDdriver,wait..me?
19-01-2018T18:09:42,SageSaga,"i mean if he was like ""Im gonna hang out with my best friend- BILL GATES."" I get it"
19-01-2018T18:09:54,Bgrmystr2,"Some people think just cuz they know someone, everyone must know them XD"
19-01-2018T18:09:55,SageSaga,Bill is a cool guy
19-01-2018T18:10:31,TheFDdriver,leaves
19-01-2018T18:10:35,Bgrmystr2,"FD, you're obviously not cuz you weren't dropping names of anyone lol"
19-01-2018T18:11:04,SageSaga,yeah we clearly werent talking about you
19-01-2018T18:11:11,TheFDdriver,comes back
19-01-2018T18:11:29,sunblaze,what is stranger is yeah chu is not streaming I am gonna go
19-01-2018T18:11:31,TheFDdriver,I didnt knew
19-01-2018T18:11:45,Bgrmystr2,Another thing I'll probably never understand. xD
19-01-2018T18:11:49,sunblaze,there is quality art of other people! no matter what your actual preferences might be
19-01-2018T18:12:03,SageSaga,he didnt mean Chu wasnt streaming -he was talking about Tom there
19-01-2018T18:12:25,SageSaga,"he was like ""Oh- Tom isnt streaming anymore- bye"""
19-01-2018T18:12:38,sunblaze,still a rude way
19-01-2018T18:12:46,TheFDdriver,true
19-01-2018T18:13:03,SageSaga,i get it - some people just arent into girls with skin :D
19-01-2018T18:13:18,sunblaze,^haha
19-01-2018T18:13:23,TheFDdriver,"thats like saying ""he ain't streaming? Bye"""
19-01-2018T18:13:24,Ordithus,"Sad, isn't it?"
19-01-2018T18:14:15,SageSaga,personally i would join - see that hes not streaming - and leave without saying anything if i wasnt interested in another streamer
19-01-2018T18:15:35,SageSaga,"and if someone in chat called me out- ""Hey Sage!"" i'd be like ""H-Hey! Hi! Nice to see yall! I was just- checking in, gotta go- nice work!"" and ditch :P"
19-01-2018T18:15:55,TheFDdriver,XD
19-01-2018T18:16:30,TheFDdriver,"well brb, gotta do the homework"
19-01-2018T18:16:33,SageSaga,"or now i kinda wanna join and me like ""Oh... It's just Tom, guess i'll leave"" and just watch what people say"
19-01-2018T18:16:41,Ordithus,ha
19-01-2018T18:16:51,ZRO4825,"That's like me joining and being like ""Oh, no Toyoko on screen tonight? I'm out."" D:"
19-01-2018T18:17:04,ZRO4825,"'cept I couldn't do that, cuz it's freaking rude &gt;:("
19-01-2018T18:17:14,sunblaze,buuuut robot girls!
19-01-2018T18:17:18,ZRO4825,"Well, that, and there's more to love here than JUST Toyoko :thinking:"
19-01-2018T18:17:26,SageSaga,"""That's Kate, not Toyoko! IM OUT DUDES!"""
19-01-2018T18:17:37,ZRO4825,"Hey, we got a sexy elf lady to go with our robot ladies and catgirls now!"
19-01-2018T18:17:51,sunblaze,true and thats a very good thing
19-01-2018T18:18:23,SageSaga,now all that said- I dont think that guy was trying to be rude- and i shouldnt call him out like i did- hes probably a fine guy maybe a bit awkward and trying to find a way to fit in
19-01-2018T18:18:43,sunblaze,yeah perhaps
19-01-2018T18:19:07,SageSaga,i'll say that about a lot of you so feel free to screen cap that for later use XD
19-01-2018T18:19:23,ZRO4825,"Nah, I won't need it. If I'm trying to be rude you'll know it. :P"
19-01-2018T18:26:53,Tharkis,"i'm unintentionally rude sometimes, but i never TRY to be rude =)"
19-01-2018T18:27:02,Tharkis,i like getting along with everyone =)

19-01-2018T18:37:20,SageSaga,it's so simple and so good
19-01-2018T18:37:21,TheFDdriver,but that would hurt
19-01-2018T18:37:34,BadFoMo,"Hmm. I want to Troll and point out the link, but I've already cracked that joke a few times."
19-01-2018T18:38:45,TheFDdriver,doesn't lmao hurts?
19-01-2018T18:40:14,Ordithus,It removes the booty
19-01-2018T18:40:22,ZRO4825,"Nope. Doesn't seem to be working either, though..."
19-01-2018T18:41:25,Danodan94,"Oh, Hi Zro."

19-01-2018T18:45:18,MatyMaty,this night scene is so nice
19-01-2018T18:45:46,Danodan94,Mhm
19-01-2018T18:45:59,MatyMaty,there is something about the contrast betwen Kaylin's and Nina is super nice
19-01-2018T18:46:18,SageSaga,Nyna
19-01-2018T18:46:21,ZRO4825,They're adorable &lt;3
19-01-2018T18:48:12,MatyMaty,Nyna XO}
19-01-2018T18:48:14,Ordithus,"Sage, will there be books of AI one day?"
19-01-2018T18:48:21,MatyMaty,stupid autocorrect
19-01-2018T18:48:31,SageSaga,i hope so - i plan to
19-01-2018T18:48:39,MatyMaty,There will be
19-01-2018T18:48:45,Ordithus,Sweet
19-01-2018T18:48:49,MatyMaty,Dakimakuras and cast off figures? :O
19-01-2018T18:48:59,SageSaga,at least Dakis if i can
19-01-2018T18:49:14,ZRO4825,o.o;  semi-lewd dakis?
19-01-2018T18:49:20,SageSaga,of course
19-01-2018T18:49:25,ZRO4825,Oh my~
19-01-2018T18:49:40,ZRO4825,"I wanted to get one of Fluff's ARA dakis, but I didn't have the funds to spare at the time ;_;"
19-01-2018T18:49:47,SageSaga,Nyna Butt Mousepad and Kaylin and Relm Oppai mouse pads
19-01-2018T18:49:49,ZRO4825,"...well, that, and no pillow to put it on anyway :thinking:"
19-01-2018T18:49:51,MatyMaty,I'd get a Relm daki XD
19-01-2018T18:50:07,ZRO4825,"...those are awesome ideas, Sage, lol"
19-01-2018T18:50:18,Ordithus,Are you calling Nyna flat
19-01-2018T18:50:33,SageSaga,shes pretty flat
19-01-2018T18:50:46,SageSaga,but shes got a great butt
19-01-2018T18:50:56,ZRO4825,"she's not FLAT...but let's face it, compared to what she's surrounded by, she's pretty flat :P"
19-01-2018T18:51:02,Ordithus,Tru
19-01-2018T18:51:07,ZRO4825,Wait...need to have a Nyna vs Flora flat battle.
19-01-2018T18:51:24,sunblaze,flat battle.......
19-01-2018T18:51:26,Ordithus,Flora would be the only one to really care...
19-01-2018T18:51:26,sunblaze,wow :D
19-01-2018T18:51:50,SageSaga,dont call it a battle- Nyna will probably take it literally
19-01-2018T18:52:14,Ordithus,Flora doesn't know magic.  Poor girl
19-01-2018T18:52:16,ZRO4825,....good point :joy:
19-01-2018T18:53:33,ZRO4825,Maybe put them on a Bust-less chart? :D
19-01-2018T18:54:03,SageSaga,im looking forward to when Nyna meets Relm
19-01-2018T18:54:12,ZRO4825,".....did you ever do a Yosh! bust chart? I feel like you did, but I also feel like I'm wrong."
19-01-2018T18:54:24,SageSaga,i did but technically its not finished
19-01-2018T18:54:29,SageSaga,didnt get enough support for it
19-01-2018T18:54:35,ZRO4825,"awww, pewp :("
19-01-2018T18:54:53,ZRO4825,is filled with determination to finish.
19-01-2018T18:55:01,SageSaga,got most of the characters though
19-01-2018T18:55:22,MatyMaty,v.v
19-01-2018T18:55:39,ZRO4825,We should make Maty do it. :P
19-01-2018T18:55:45,ZRO4825,:thinking:
19-01-2018T18:56:01,ZRO4825,"Suddenly, I wanna see a Toyoko drawn by Maty. :joy:"
19-01-2018T18:56:57,SageSaga,oh i dont think Maty saw the Toyoko picture
19-01-2018T18:57:11,ZRO4825,:o
19-01-2018T18:57:17,ZRO4825,\[T]/
19-01-2018T18:57:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\[T]/
19-01-2018T18:57:21,MatyMaty,I didn't D:
19-01-2018T18:57:32,MatyMaty,Ooooh!
19-01-2018T18:57:39,MatyMaty,I love that dress XD
19-01-2018T18:58:04,ZRO4825,"I was randomly going back through the comic, saw it and was like ""This needs redone"" and thus came this month's request. :joy:"
19-01-2018T18:58:05,SageSaga,its the dress she wore on her date night with Shiden waaay back
19-01-2018T18:58:37,ZRO4825,Too bad it's only the one side. Wasn't that a pretty much backless dress too iirc?
19-01-2018T18:59:01,SageSaga,hmm - i think
19-01-2018T18:59:10,ZRO4825,I must go check now out of curiosity
19-01-2018T18:59:20,MatyMaty,well after the Sarah drawing
19-01-2018T18:59:28,MatyMaty,I need to do another Sage OC
19-01-2018T18:59:36,MatyMaty,although maybe an anim would be nice
19-01-2018T18:59:59,SageSaga,you already have an animation half done
19-01-2018T19:00:13,ZRO4825,o.o
19-01-2018T19:00:47,SageSaga,and im done
19-01-2018T19:01:10,Ordithus,Very nice!
19-01-2018T19:01:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very Nicely done Sage
19-01-2018T19:01:22,MoonDance,Looks really amazing
19-01-2018T19:01:52,SageSaga,ive been wondering about this song and who its about-
19-01-2018T19:02:48,ZRO4825,"lol, I'd almost forgotten 'bout the 1000 comics image. Blue giving Toyoko the wet t-shirt treatment. :rofl:"
19-01-2018T19:03:15,SageSaga,i did a flat out wet t-shirt image in the art book-
19-01-2018T19:03:20,SageSaga,was that ever posted?
19-01-2018T19:03:46,ZRO4825,I think it's the same one...maybe? I gotta check the book.
19-01-2018T19:03:53,ZRO4825,....I gotta remember where I PUT the book...
19-01-2018T19:04:04,SageSaga,its not the same at all
19-01-2018T19:04:32,ZRO4825,:thinking:
19-01-2018T19:05:18,MatyMaty,Yes but
19-01-2018T19:05:20,SageSaga,old fanart
19-01-2018T19:05:25,MatyMaty,That one looks old :P
19-01-2018T19:05:34,MatyMaty,I gotta make a new one
19-01-2018T19:05:40,ZRO4825,dawwww

19-01-2018T19:17:44,Tharkis,hrm.  question for you Sage.  Do you have a recommendation of a good place to have a large professional quality print made of a piece of art?
19-01-2018T19:17:48,ZRO4825,It came out so well too!
19-01-2018T19:17:51,SageSaga,all the flames were hand panted - not an image or patern
19-01-2018T19:18:01,Tharkis,pretty fire wings &lt;3
19-01-2018T19:18:06,SageSaga,hmmm- actually Tom is better to ask for that
19-01-2018T19:18:16,SageSaga,Tom has more stuff printed
19-01-2018T19:18:24,ZRO4825,Dare I ask how long all those flames took to do?
19-01-2018T19:18:30,Tharkis,will ask him tomorrow if i can catch his stream then
19-01-2018T19:18:32,Bgrmystr2,"To be honest, Thark, I got a large poster from InkedFur for one of Fluff's artpieces"
19-01-2018T19:18:35,Bgrmystr2,and it's super good quality
19-01-2018T19:18:40,Bgrmystr2,so you can check with them
19-01-2018T19:18:40,Tharkis,i just had a commission finished last night
19-01-2018T19:18:44,SageSaga,i dont think this took all that long to make actually
19-01-2018T19:18:44,Tharkis,and it's SO @#%#@%@#% GOOOD
19-01-2018T19:18:49,Tharkis,like mind bogglingly so

19-01-2018T19:19:04,Tharkis,it's that amazing
19-01-2018T19:19:10,SageSaga,link it if it is SFW?
19-01-2018T19:19:32,Tharkis,"aye it's safe for work.  let me link the small version, the full version is over 12 megs in size even in jpg format, ti's like 40+ in png"

19-01-2018T19:20:45,ZRO4825,"Damn that's some detail work, holy shit o.o;"
19-01-2018T19:20:53,SageSaga,i think Tom usually uses Overnight Prints
19-01-2018T19:20:58,Tharkis,there's so much detail you cant even see in that small size image
19-01-2018T19:21:04,ZRO4825,Do I even wanna know how much you had to shell out for that? lol
19-01-2018T19:21:05,Tharkis,the full size is not quite 8k resolution
19-01-2018T19:21:15,Tharkis,like 6000x3400 or so
19-01-2018T19:21:23,Bgrmystr2,"I'd love to see it, honestly"
19-01-2018T19:21:35,Ordithus,That could make quite the sizeable print
19-01-2018T19:21:36,Bgrmystr2,detail is amazing to look at
19-01-2018T19:21:58,SageSaga,my banner is 9900x25500

19-01-2018T19:22:45,Tharkis,"in the small size, it's almost hard to tell it's a painting"
19-01-2018T19:22:47,ZRO4825,AH HA! Finally found a backshot of that damned dress! :joy:

19-01-2018T19:23:51,SageSaga,if i drew it again id make it backless to the butt
19-01-2018T19:24:01,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I'm still checking the next few pages, looks like it wasn't quite that far down"
19-01-2018T19:25:00,ZRO4825,"Yar, no more see it after that."
