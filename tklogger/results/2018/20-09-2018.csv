20-09-2018T05:22:57,Twokinds,Hello!
20-09-2018T05:23:07,Twokinds,I am in Korea!
20-09-2018T05:23:39,iliar,"Good evening, Tom."
20-09-2018T05:23:57,BadFoMo,Cool.
20-09-2018T05:25:51,Twokinds,I had a very very very long journey
20-09-2018T05:27:22,Bgrmystr2,TOM :ptv-excited:
20-09-2018T05:27:32,Bgrmystr2,You're alive! How'd the flight go?
20-09-2018T05:27:36,Bgrmystr2,did you sleep through it as planned?
20-09-2018T05:29:23,iliar,Recently working on a bot I found a couple of bugs with your site. Probably now you do not have the opportunity to fix them. Could you tell me who else is working with site and to whom I could say about technical problems?
20-09-2018T05:32:15,Bgrmystr2,Fairly sure it's Turaiel that's the web admin for the site?
20-09-2018T05:32:22,Bgrmystr2,if I recall correctly
20-09-2018T05:36:12,ThingsAreMoving,o/
20-09-2018T05:36:50,ThingsAreMoving,":ctwokinds-nibsbounce: How does it feel to be synchronized with the timezone, Tom?"
20-09-2018T05:36:57,Dadrobit,"o/ Tom, hope it was a bearable trip overall."
20-09-2018T05:38:18,iliar,And I wonder how often Tom goes to Korea?
20-09-2018T05:40:08,Twokinds,First time since 2004
20-09-2018T05:40:47,ThingsAreMoving,That's... a long time ago.
20-09-2018T05:41:27,iliar,Very long time ago.
20-09-2018T05:41:56,iliar,For some reason I was sure that this happens much more often.
20-09-2018T05:42:17,Dadrobit,That is a considerable period of time.
20-09-2018T05:46:12,Dadrobit,FaceBook was first launched in 2004.
20-09-2018T05:47:24,Twokinds,"Funny thing, it's such a long time ago, and yet, I was still already doing Twokinds even then."
20-09-2018T05:49:16,Dadrobit,"Heck, I was only in the 8th/9th grade. I was a youngin'."
20-09-2018T05:49:43,Twokinds,"Anyway, dead tired, I need sleep. Goodnight!"
20-09-2018T05:49:57,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-natanisleep: nighty night
20-09-2018T05:50:06,iliar,Goodnight
20-09-2018T05:50:27,Dadrobit,"Right on, have a good rest, man."
20-09-2018T05:50:49,ThingsAreMoving,"huh, it's nearly 8PM over there"
20-09-2018T05:50:58,ThingsAreMoving,Tom going to sleep earlier than normal
20-09-2018T05:51:18,Bgrmystr2,"s'bout time for me to head to sleep too, 5:51am"
20-09-2018T05:51:22,ThingsAreMoving,maybe a looong trip is a way to reset one's sleep cycle
20-09-2018T05:51:28,ThingsAreMoving,o/ bgr
20-09-2018T05:51:30,Bgrmystr2,seems about right for tom's sleep schedule haha
20-09-2018T05:51:33,ThingsAreMoving,have good Zzzz's
20-09-2018T05:51:55,Bgrmystr2,I will have good :zzz: :ptv-sleepy:
20-09-2018T05:52:36,iliar,"According to the experience of business trips, I can say that the time of day does not matter. After a long trip, you in any case want to relax, regardless of the time of day."
20-09-2018T06:11:47,Dadrobit,"Man, looking back in time now at 2004. Very good year for movies."
20-09-2018T09:03:26,CommanderTrace,hi whats up?
20-09-2018T11:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Missed him
20-09-2018T11:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Check ins are gonna be weird with this time zone thing. But my üëãüèª is here for future reference
20-09-2018T12:10:52,Dadrobit,"Quick poll. Which looks better. Dude with shaggy hair, or dude with short ponytail?"
20-09-2018T12:28:50,Xexanoth,"most times short ponytails look stupid, so let's go with shaggy hair"

20-09-2018T13:03:45,CrimsonQuill,You're welcome
20-09-2018T14:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ponytail looks nice if it‚Äôs pinned good, but loose fluff is good"
20-09-2018T14:47:27,CrimsonQuill,????
20-09-2018T14:47:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Read
20-09-2018T14:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Chat
20-09-2018T14:47:58,CrimsonQuill,AH.
20-09-2018T14:48:28,SpazztasticKiwi,If it‚Äôs long enough try a bun but make sure it doesn‚Äôt look like someone slapped a dumpling on your head. Full bun or no bun
20-09-2018T14:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again it‚Äôs also a case of whatever you want to look like since it‚Äôs your hair
20-09-2018T15:51:58,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: mmm
20-09-2018T16:08:40,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, ended up going with a short ponytail in a vest and rolled up sleeves. Had to get some professional-ish photos taken so that folks looking me up see something that resembles an indiviudal slightly more put together than a half polished turd."
20-09-2018T16:08:47,Dadrobit,"Also, good for Tinder."
20-09-2018T16:09:18,Dadrobit,"Not enough hair for a man-bun. Also, too much pride."
20-09-2018T16:14:44,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
20-09-2018T16:48:01,ThingsAreMoving,if you can tie all your hair in a ponytail then it's long enough imho
20-09-2018T17:21:05,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs not pride that should prevent a man bun. It‚Äôs self respect
20-09-2018T17:40:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"On the other hand, we‚Äôve apparently gotten some new noodle for the cold case and it tastes like something that is just simply called ‚ÄúAsian stir fry‚Äù"
20-09-2018T17:40:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And it‚Äôs amazing
20-09-2018T17:40:58,CrimsonQuill,I like potatoes. Roosters are the best sort

20-09-2018T20:25:17,Mihari,"Blue, because she tries sometimes."
20-09-2018T20:25:42,Mihari,"Nyna is capable of killing you, so she looses quite a bit of cute points there, unless you're well... into that."
20-09-2018T20:26:07,Bgrmystr2,ability to kill you means nothing to the level of cuteness.
20-09-2018T20:26:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ah, deadly can be cute.  Look at the blue ringed octopus"
20-09-2018T20:26:18,Mihari,Something that is scary isn't nessicarly cute :P
20-09-2018T20:26:18,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah!

20-09-2018T20:27:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,only unsteady
20-09-2018T20:27:09,Mihari,Doubtful :P

20-09-2018T20:27:18,Mihari,He'd probably be the first?
20-09-2018T20:27:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he looks like a small john wick.  whats not to love
20-09-2018T20:27:43,Bgrmystr2,that's not really relevant though is it? It's simply a matter that power doesn't have to be feared.

20-09-2018T20:31:11,Bgrmystr2,"it is boring, marv"
20-09-2018T20:31:20,SageSaga,Physically- I think shes cute as heck- but personality- for her to respect you- you either need to be respected by someone else stronger than her- or you need to be stronger - She's pretty clear on that
20-09-2018T20:31:20,Bgrmystr2,weird is part of life :)
20-09-2018T20:31:47,SageSaga,She respects strength- and she's never met a human worth respecting
20-09-2018T20:32:03,unsteddyphoenix,She really does sound like a cat
20-09-2018T20:32:08,Crimellgrim,good thing I'm not human then

20-09-2018T21:55:18,Mihari,"If you're not really a regular to the Friday stream, it's probably not likely to be added. Sorry."
20-09-2018T21:55:48,Fyrephase,"Yo, Fluff!"

20-09-2018T21:57:15,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh! No Tom stream, eh?:ptv-wondering:"
20-09-2018T21:57:30,Deciem,Does Tom normally stream rn?
20-09-2018T21:57:31,Mihari,Show up would be the first and primary criteria.
20-09-2018T21:57:36,Bgrmystr2,"yes he does, Deciem"
20-09-2018T21:57:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tom's on vacation
20-09-2018T21:57:38,Mihari,Tom is on vacation with family.
20-09-2018T21:57:45,unsteddyphoenix,"No, you need to already be a part of it to be a part of it /s"
20-09-2018T21:57:50,Mislakane,do I count? :ptv-uneasy:
20-09-2018T21:57:55,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno why James is asking, he's been here when tom said he wasn't gonna be streaming."
20-09-2018T21:58:02,Mihari,"Fluff is a guest tonight, and some how fighting against his primal urges to be SFW Tonight so applaud him for his efforts!"
20-09-2018T21:58:09,FluffKevlar,:P
20-09-2018T21:58:20,Deciem,Fluff can turn off the horny if he needs to

20-09-2018T21:58:59,unsteddyphoenix,He voluntarily draws sfw stuff! Sometimes!
20-09-2018T21:59:03,KendrakkinTheLymbodian,sadly my program doesnt brain that. lol.
20-09-2018T21:59:06,Bgrmystr2,contrary to popular belief.. I guess some people have such little faith in Fluff.
20-09-2018T21:59:12,Bgrmystr2,but I believe.
20-09-2018T21:59:41,Deciem,I want to see Fluff draw in person some day
20-09-2018T21:59:58,Desirnee,Just found my old bamboo tablet :ptv-excited:
20-09-2018T22:00:04,Deciem,nice!
20-09-2018T22:00:08,Desirnee,Gonna draw on it tonight lmao
20-09-2018T22:00:23,Mihari,"I am mostly teasing Fluff, he's well aware. Otherwise I'd probably getting chewed out."
20-09-2018T22:03:20,Deciem,Anything new on Spotify today?

20-09-2018T22:18:19,Grip,Can't forget the tail.
20-09-2018T22:18:20,NuwaNightstone,:cnuwanightstone-lewdpanda2:
20-09-2018T22:18:50,unsteddyphoenix,YESSSS
20-09-2018T22:18:55,unsteddyphoenix,Big fan!

20-09-2018T22:19:29,Mihari,Not a D&D night T_T
20-09-2018T22:19:40,NuwaNightstone,I wouldn't mind taking her out for walkies :cnuwanightstone-ahegaopanda2:
20-09-2018T22:19:44,Deciem,no game night? wtf
20-09-2018T22:19:53,Deciem,Fluff what the hell
20-09-2018T22:19:59,NuwaNightstone,I'm running a D&D game right now
20-09-2018T22:20:03,NuwaNightstone,Pathfinder to be more specific!
20-09-2018T22:20:05,Bgrmystr2,"Tom's on vacation, of course not, Deciem xD"
20-09-2018T22:20:11,unsteddyphoenix,its...the 22nd now for me whats happening
20-09-2018T22:20:22,unsteddyphoenix,should I be doing something
20-09-2018T22:20:37,ZoieFalcona,*peeks in*
20-09-2018T22:20:38,NuwaNightstone,Also this Crypt of the Necrodancer music is poppin &lt;3
20-09-2018T22:20:52,Deciem,Korea? Is he getting the animation job of his dreams
20-09-2018T22:21:05,Bgrmystr2,no he's  visiting family
20-09-2018T22:21:11,NuwaNightstone,Panda-ra? :cnuwanightstone-panda-laugh:
20-09-2018T22:22:24,unsteddyphoenix,"oh oktoberfest, right"
20-09-2018T22:22:25,Grip,"Been recently watching the old Dungeons and Dragons cartoon. Good show, and finally saw the ending of it."
20-09-2018T22:23:15,ZoieFalcona,Beers and brats
20-09-2018T22:23:29,Bgrmystr2,I thought that was a european thing?
20-09-2018T22:23:29,Deciem,I love oktoberfest. Marzen beer is so good
20-09-2018T22:24:06,NuwaNightstone,I love the female oktoberfest clothes
20-09-2018T22:24:08,NuwaNightstone,They're so cute &lt;3
20-09-2018T22:24:09,ZoieFalcona,"Largely it's a German thing. The US having a very large community of Germans in various states like Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and others"
20-09-2018T22:24:11,Mihari,Not being able to drink throws a bit of a skew on my opinion of Oktoberfest.
20-09-2018T22:24:11,NuwaNightstone,:cnuwanightstone-ahegaopanda2:
20-09-2018T22:24:27,Mihari,No.
20-09-2018T22:24:30,Bgrmystr2,I thought so Zoie
20-09-2018T22:24:35,Deciem,What about warm pretzels?
20-09-2018T22:24:42,Deciem,those are still good
20-09-2018T22:24:43,Mihari,Seriously? You've known me how many years?
20-09-2018T22:25:25,Deciem,"not everyone can drink alcohol. It is a poison, after all"
20-09-2018T22:25:27,unsteddyphoenix,How many times have you gone out on the town together though
20-09-2018T22:26:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,How many midnight trains to any where is a better question
20-09-2018T22:26:45,Deciem,spaten is good. they supply it for the local Oktoberfest
20-09-2018T22:26:58,ZoieFalcona,"Mihari, there is more to Oktoberfest than brews.  The food, events, and the crowd!  Kinda like the Bavarian version of a state fair."
20-09-2018T22:27:00,Deciem,omg
20-09-2018T22:27:16,unsteddyphoenix,niiiice haul
20-09-2018T22:27:19,Deciem,did you raid bevmo?
20-09-2018T22:27:34,Bgrmystr2,"lol one of them is named ""Harpoon"""
20-09-2018T22:27:36,Mihari,"Yes, Zoie, I'm very aware, but try goign wit ha bunch friends who want to do that, and they know you can't, it's a huge mood kill."
20-09-2018T22:28:44,unsteddyphoenix,SOMEone needs to be the sober driver
20-09-2018T22:28:55,Mihari,"These days? Not really.,"
20-09-2018T22:29:01,Mihari,"Uber, Taxis, etc."
20-09-2018T22:29:01,ZoieFalcona,yeah..  -.-  sorry
20-09-2018T22:29:13,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt uber illegal in some states?
20-09-2018T22:29:15,Bgrmystr2,well.. yeah but someone's driving the Uber / Taxi right? :o
20-09-2018T22:29:22,ReccaSenLi,yo
20-09-2018T22:29:27,Mihari,I have no idea.
20-09-2018T22:29:30,Bgrmystr2,unless you're goin with driverless cars xD
20-09-2018T22:29:37,ReccaSenLi,drive to my house
20-09-2018T22:29:57,Deciem,Are we all invited?
20-09-2018T22:30:40,ReccaSenLi,sure why not
20-09-2018T22:30:49,unsteddyphoenix,\o/
20-09-2018T22:32:01,NuwaNightstone,Zofie is such a cute lady :cnuwanightstone-ahegaopanda2::cnuwanightstone-lewdpanda2:
20-09-2018T22:32:06,Deciem,"Yeah, that was bad news"
20-09-2018T22:32:40,unsteddyphoenix,Best Fluffgurl~
20-09-2018T22:32:40,NuwaNightstone,"Yeah that was some interesting news, kind of out of left field, I thought their games were selling well"
20-09-2018T22:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd try Oktoberfest
20-09-2018T22:33:04,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs so far
20-09-2018T22:33:23,Deciem,"The Kotaku article said they had several games that bombed, and they had so many people working that they had razor thin margins"
20-09-2018T22:33:33,ZoieFalcona,That is something I can't do anymore.
20-09-2018T22:33:56,Deciem,The Batman and Game of Thrones titles did
20-09-2018T22:34:05,unsteddyphoenix,Thatd make sense
20-09-2018T22:34:08,Mippy,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
20-09-2018T22:34:10,Deciem,and those licenses are not cheap
20-09-2018T22:34:13,unsteddyphoenix,"I played a lot of their games, but I couldnt finish those ones"
20-09-2018T22:34:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Actually I did finish GoT, but I really didnt like it"
20-09-2018T22:34:53,HeresyArtStream,I think Telltale's problem is that they kind of got too comfortable in terms of gameplay.
20-09-2018T22:34:58,ZoieFalcona,"From what I read, it was basically management and lawsuits that hurt the company"
20-09-2018T22:35:03,Deciem,"All the artists were fired without severance, too. They were screwed."
20-09-2018T22:35:14,HeresyArtStream,When it came to that kind of interactive fiction genre they're the best but not a lot seems to change in terms of gameplay.
20-09-2018T22:35:25,ZoieFalcona,lawsuits against the management for extreme hours under threat of termination
20-09-2018T22:35:48,HeresyArtStream,"I used to get mad hype every time a Telltale game got announced but lately I have been more like ""oh, that's neat."" and then I forget to ever play it."
20-09-2018T22:36:10,ZoieFalcona,let alone the former founder suing the company for money
20-09-2018T22:36:25,Deciem,"Another thing is that people were not buying their games at full price, if they were buying them at all"
20-09-2018T22:36:42,HeresyArtStream,yeah
20-09-2018T22:36:46,HeresyArtStream,that's a good point
20-09-2018T22:37:40,HeresyArtStream,"One things I've often complained about in Telltale games is that their games seem to focus a lot more on branching conversations, and in recent years have lacked the interesting logic puzzles of 90s adventure games."
20-09-2018T22:37:49,unsteddyphoenix,I almots feel like they released games too quickly
20-09-2018T22:38:08,unsteddyphoenix,A lot fell by the wayside without gaining enough hype-momentum
20-09-2018T22:38:19,Deciem,"Mostly, it sounded like poor management, and them not reading the market well enough to spend their resources wisely"
20-09-2018T22:38:23,HeresyArtStream,"Like, my dream was always that someday we'd see adventure games where puzzles have multiple solutions, but instead puzzles kind of got abandoned altogether."
20-09-2018T22:38:56,Deciem,"Not because of bad games, but just spreading themselves too thin for their output"
20-09-2018T22:39:02,HeresyArtStream,that too
20-09-2018T22:39:36,HeresyArtStream,"I think instead of releasing so many games with different licenses, they should have focused on a smaller selection of games that have new innovations for the genre."
20-09-2018T22:39:40,Deciem,"I haven't played all their games, but that was a complaint I was hearing"
20-09-2018T22:39:57,Deciem,too much cookie cutter gameplay
20-09-2018T22:40:02,HeresyArtStream,yep
20-09-2018T22:40:05,FluffKevlar,my friend Ash loved TTG
20-09-2018T22:40:22,FluffKevlar,but he was also notorious for waiting til everything was cheap as possible
20-09-2018T22:40:30,FluffKevlar,so i told him he killed his own fav studio
20-09-2018T22:40:37,HeresyArtStream,lol
20-09-2018T22:40:43,unsteddyphoenix,Ruthless
20-09-2018T22:40:59,Deciem,"dang, you are savage, Fluff"
20-09-2018T22:41:03,Deciem,savage birb
20-09-2018T22:41:10,HeresyArtStream,"Like, imagine if Telltale had made a game with a more opened up play area, where there are things like physics puzzles and stuff."
20-09-2018T22:41:14,NuwaNightstone,:cnuwanightstone-gaspingpanda2:
20-09-2018T22:41:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Same Ash, enjoyed most of the games, dont think I ever bought one full price lol"
20-09-2018T22:41:18,HeresyArtStream,"Remember how huge Portal was, after all."
20-09-2018T22:41:28,savageshark,"btw sry ive been so quiet, been working on my comms"
20-09-2018T22:41:35,HeresyArtStream,Portal was in some ways a successor to the point and click adventure game format.
20-09-2018T22:41:40,savageshark,"also I couldnt help have my ears perk when I saw ""savage'"
20-09-2018T22:41:42,savageshark,XD
20-09-2018T22:41:53,Deciem,Portal was good. Too good. They haven't made any more
20-09-2018T22:42:19,Deciem,if you don't count mod levels
20-09-2018T22:42:23,SageSaga,brb
20-09-2018T22:42:26,Bgrmystr2,Portal.. 2..? :ptv-wondering:
20-09-2018T22:42:29,HeresyArtStream,"I mean, basically what I'm saying is that Telltale needed and still probably needs some outside the box thinking in terms of gameplay."
20-09-2018T22:42:54,HeresyArtStream,Their character interaction systems are great but they need to mix things up with the gameplay instead of being so predictable.
20-09-2018T22:43:17,Deciem,What was the other game studio that closed?
20-09-2018T22:43:36,Deciem,I heard two studios closed today
20-09-2018T22:43:41,SageSaga,back
20-09-2018T22:43:52,Deciem,and a thing about how game devs need to organize
20-09-2018T22:44:14,Deciem,so they don't wind up on the street if their studio shuts down
20-09-2018T22:44:48,ZRO4825,wb~
20-09-2018T22:45:25,Bgrmystr2,"oh damn, this song is awesome fluff"
20-09-2018T22:45:27,HeresyArtStream,Another thing is that I think people's expectations for production values today are higher than what Telltale regularly delivers.
20-09-2018T22:45:27,Bgrmystr2,what is it?
20-09-2018T22:45:44,Deciem,wow
20-09-2018T22:46:06,Deciem,"well, you are on the furry path now"
20-09-2018T22:46:09,ZRO4825,"Well look at it this way, Fluff. You didn't get in there, but you get to keep your job you have now while they shut down. =D"
20-09-2018T22:46:14,HeresyArtStream,"Their animations have generally been pretty low quality due to time constraints, which I think was fine early on but after 10 years I think there is a kind of unspoken expectation that they are going to start improving things a bit."
20-09-2018T22:46:28,Bgrmystr2,Rip song ded
20-09-2018T22:46:37,Mihari,Technically not true.
20-09-2018T22:46:49,HeresyArtStream,If it sounds like I am coming down hard on Telltale I don't mean to. I am just pondering out loud reasons for why their games are declining in sales.
20-09-2018T22:46:58,Deciem,farts
20-09-2018T22:47:29,unsteddyphoenix,I bet a telltale furry game would sell
20-09-2018T22:47:39,unsteddyphoenix,Last ditch effort Telltale: talltails
20-09-2018T22:47:42,HeresyArtStream,"I am sad to see them having trouble, since they were really carrying the torch for one of my favorite genres that had basically gone through extinction as soon as FPS games got popular. :&lt;"
20-09-2018T22:47:48,ZRO4825,I honestly haven't bought a Telltale game yet myself. Got a couple through Humble Monthly I think though.
20-09-2018T22:47:50,Bgrmystr2,I wish fluff's song title thing was workin lol
20-09-2018T22:48:24,HeresyArtStream,You probably need to update Snip
20-09-2018T22:48:37,HeresyArtStream,Every time it stops working for me I go check for an update.
20-09-2018T22:49:00,HeresyArtStream,It does that to me too. X3
20-09-2018T22:49:32,Mippy,Stuff is looking great Fluff and Sage.  Getting tired so I'm gonna go for the night. By bye
20-09-2018T22:50:27,Busterdrag,hoi
20-09-2018T22:50:29,Domino,"you put out the alpha version for $20, and then never leave alpha testing phase"
20-09-2018T22:50:38,Busterdrag,is dat Zofie?
20-09-2018T22:50:48,ZRO4825,Looks like some Zofie to me
20-09-2018T22:50:50,HeresyArtStream,I think Telltale played things a little too safe. They had a formula that worked but they haven't really changed it in a long time.
20-09-2018T22:50:59,Busterdrag,sounds like some Zofie to me too
20-09-2018T22:51:06,Busterdrag,considering she is german
20-09-2018T22:51:18,Deciem,She's not a German Shepard
20-09-2018T22:51:25,unsteddyphoenix,I can agree with that. The barest of innovation would've been all that they needed.
20-09-2018T22:51:32,HeresyArtStream,"Like, imagine if Telltale made a game that was more like an RPG and had action elements? Even if it were controversial the feedback from it could give them a sense of what direction to move in with their next game."
20-09-2018T22:51:36,Obsidianwolf117,"""voof!"""
20-09-2018T22:51:37,Deciem,shepherd?
20-09-2018T22:51:56,Busterdrag,"no Deciem, I mean"
20-09-2018T22:52:01,Busterdrag,she SPEAKS german
20-09-2018T22:54:21,unsteddyphoenix,You mean action elements that ARENT quicktime events
20-09-2018T22:54:37,HeresyArtStream,"yes, exactly."
20-09-2018T22:54:51,HeresyArtStream,"Like, I know it's an old game, but think back to Senmue."
20-09-2018T22:55:17,HeresyArtStream,"It has a lot of elements that a Telltale game has but it experimented with a lot of ideas, even if some of them were stupid."
20-09-2018T22:55:27,ZRO4825,"I actually enjoy quicktime events on big huge cinematic boss fights and such, but not like, the entire game or anything."
20-09-2018T22:55:53,Domino,"nah, I'm sure that the execs at EA love quicktime events"
20-09-2018T22:56:01,HeresyArtStream,Quicktime events can add a little bit of flavor but imo they are no substitute for real gameplay.
20-09-2018T22:56:04,unsteddyphoenix,Whaaat? thats my exact LEAST favourite time for QTEs
20-09-2018T22:56:25,Deciem,"Maybe try it just once, to see what it's like"
20-09-2018T22:56:27,unsteddyphoenix,I played a Space Marine game once and the final boss was QTEs
20-09-2018T22:56:43,unsteddyphoenix,"It was a huge let down, seriously."
20-09-2018T22:56:57,HeresyArtStream,"Like, if there's a cutscene and then there's a button prompt that can be neat. If I am fighting a 100 foot tall monster thoguh, I want to actually do it with the skills I've learned in the game, not my mashing a few button prompts."
20-09-2018T22:57:17,HeresyArtStream,"I like the sense of ""oh crap how am I going to fight that thing?"""
20-09-2018T22:58:07,HeresyArtStream,"But like, Shenmue basically pioneered QTEs but it also had a really solid player-controlled combat system."
20-09-2018T22:58:20,HeresyArtStream,It also had a large play area that players could freely explore.
20-09-2018T22:59:02,HeresyArtStream,"Telltale games tend to be kind of claustrophobic and operate on a fairly strict ""schedule."" Even if you could explore areas at your leisure there wouldn't be much to find."
20-09-2018T22:59:33,unsteddyphoenix,"A lot of the ""choices"" were only feigned too. More than you'd realise if you played one a second time around"
20-09-2018T22:59:51,HeresyArtStream,"I know some people would groan if they did a walking dead game with shooting and survival mechanics, but if the conversation system and writing was still there, would that really be so bad in hindsight?"
20-09-2018T23:00:19,SageSaga,all choice is feigned
20-09-2018T23:00:29,HeresyArtStream,Any good dungeon master knows that :V
20-09-2018T23:00:35,unsteddyphoenix,Deep~
20-09-2018T23:00:35,SageSaga,free will is an illusion
20-09-2018T23:01:25,HeresyArtStream,"""I will give you three doors to walk through. All three will lead to the same place but if you go back to the other doors I will make up something menial for you to find."""
20-09-2018T23:01:32,SageSaga,"you dont choose to do anything, you are programmed by your experiences to act a certain way - even the choice not to make a choice is choosing"
20-09-2018T23:01:33,unsteddyphoenix,"I swear a slogan was ""your choices matter"""
20-09-2018T23:01:42,unsteddyphoenix,Or maybe im so used to seeing that everywhere I assumed
20-09-2018T23:02:16,HeresyArtStream,"It was Bioware who hyped up that every choice mattered, which turned out to be a lie. :V"
20-09-2018T23:02:17,ZRO4825,"Isn't that Fable that said that, unsteddy?"
20-09-2018T23:02:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Probably, to both"
20-09-2018T23:02:50,ZRO4825,"And then Fable's only choice that made an actual difference was like, the very last one at the end? lol"
20-09-2018T23:03:29,SageSaga,take the end of ME3 for example- you had 3 choices- but they were all the same... Disapointing
20-09-2018T23:03:45,SageSaga,disappointing*
20-09-2018T23:03:52,HeresyArtStream,yep :&lt;
20-09-2018T23:04:15,unsteddyphoenix,Bringing up ME3 in this context is basically like bringing up Hitler in a politics debate lol
20-09-2018T23:04:22,HeresyArtStream,lmao
20-09-2018T23:04:37,HeresyArtStream,"Yeah, maybe we're veering a bit off topic there. X3"
20-09-2018T23:04:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sage, how the üê¨üê¨üê¨ are ya"
20-09-2018T23:05:14,HeresyArtStream,"But I think if Telltale was like ""we're gonna do something different with this next game because we can't really keep doing the same thing forever, but we hope you'll give it a chance. If it's not good we'll try something else."""
20-09-2018T23:05:17,SageSaga,how the dolphin am i?
20-09-2018T23:05:22,BadFoMo,Dolphins?
20-09-2018T23:05:39,ZRO4825,porpoise
20-09-2018T23:05:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone hasn‚Äôt seen spongebob
20-09-2018T23:05:54,ZRO4825,I feel that not seeing SpongeBob is a positive thing.
20-09-2018T23:05:55,BadFoMo,Yep.
20-09-2018T23:06:01,ZRO4825,I have seen enough of it to know that I wish I hadn't.
20-09-2018T23:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,In other words: how art thou faring today?
20-09-2018T23:06:25,unsteddyphoenix,Zro.
20-09-2018T23:06:26,SageSaga,"why not say ""How are you?"""
20-09-2018T23:06:35,ZRO4825,Unsteddy.
20-09-2018T23:06:45,HeresyArtStream,"They didn't need to start making big mile-wide-inch-deep Ubisoft open world games, but I do think more open experiences with more ways to interact with the world would have been refreshing, especially if they started doing action stuff instead of just QTE"
20-09-2018T23:06:51,unsteddyphoenix,Spongebob was a masterpiece
20-09-2018T23:06:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Because it was a spongebob reference
20-09-2018T23:06:53,unsteddyphoenix,how DARE
20-09-2018T23:06:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And supposed to be fun
20-09-2018T23:07:10,HeresyArtStream,I think I am kind of talking in circles now. X3
20-09-2018T23:07:24,SpazztasticKiwi,The earlier episodes were pretty decent
20-09-2018T23:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,The new ones are üóë
20-09-2018T23:08:22,SageSaga,well now i hate spongebob more than I hate bad anatomy
20-09-2018T23:09:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,anatomy? who needs that
20-09-2018T23:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,For some reason I thought you were talking about another show. Sitting here trying to think ‚Äúwhat show is Bad Anato-oh‚Äù
20-09-2018T23:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Have they fixed your fridge yet or do I have the wrong date
20-09-2018T23:10:53,SageSaga,Fridge has been replaced

20-09-2018T23:36:02,ZRO4825,Hiyas Accelo!
20-09-2018T23:36:12,Accelo,Hey. o/
20-09-2018T23:36:18,ZRO4825,....I had something I was gonna mention to you like...a week or two ago and I have completely forgotten what it was now.
20-09-2018T23:36:46,ZRO4825,Well that's just annoying now. &gt;:(
20-09-2018T23:36:57,Accelo,:caccelo-acceloemote:
20-09-2018T23:37:13,SageSaga,Fluff still hasnt read it has he?
20-09-2018T23:37:26,Bgrmystr2,Fluff? Read comics?
20-09-2018T23:37:28,Bgrmystr2,haha
20-09-2018T23:37:28,ZRO4825,Probably not. Fluff just kinda does Fluff things.
20-09-2018T23:37:30,Bgrmystr2,silly sage
20-09-2018T23:37:41,ZRO4825,We can't even get him to make his OWN comics. :P
20-09-2018T23:37:48,ZRO4825,":thinking: Only partially true, actually."
20-09-2018T23:37:51,SageSaga,he said he'd read it!
20-09-2018T23:37:54,ZRO4825,Cuz he does do Predators.
20-09-2018T23:38:01,ZRO4825,"Find more time, Fluff! :P"
20-09-2018T23:38:12,unsteddyphoenix,Read it to him sage
20-09-2018T23:38:17,unsteddyphoenix,That might work
20-09-2018T23:38:26,Deciem,he's drawing puppy girls in underwear
20-09-2018T23:38:33,Deciem,"he's busy, in other words"
20-09-2018T23:38:51,unsteddyphoenix,More Zofie is always important
20-09-2018T23:38:52,ZRO4825,That's just another day for Fluff. :P
20-09-2018T23:39:37,Accelo,Time to find the one stray pixel.
20-09-2018T23:39:40,SageSaga,yall need to remind Fluff to read it- So he can then be motivated to draw Kaylin and Nyna
20-09-2018T23:40:18,Mihari,I can't even motivate him to work on his own site.
20-09-2018T23:40:25,ZRO4825,:joy:
20-09-2018T23:40:34,ZRO4825,Wait...Fluff has a site? Not just a patreon? :thinking:
20-09-2018T23:40:39,Grip,Night all
20-09-2018T23:40:43,ZRO4825,G'night Grip!

20-09-2018T23:40:46,Accelo,Hey Mihari. Good to see you around. c:
20-09-2018T23:41:08,Deciem,"Is it a web comic site, or something more?"
20-09-2018T23:41:45,Mihari,Let you know once it's made.
20-09-2018T23:42:33,Mihari,"Hello Accelo, I'm always here on Fridays, Fluff is just the exception XD"
20-09-2018T23:42:55,SpartaLazerz,Hey Accelo! Nice to see ya!
20-09-2018T23:43:14,SageSaga,Accelo doesnt know who i am
20-09-2018T23:43:19,Accelo,Hey Sparta
20-09-2018T23:43:52,Mihari,You're not a furry artist Sage XD
20-09-2018T23:44:03,unsteddyphoenix,Sage: Dont you know who I AM
20-09-2018T23:44:14,Accelo,I'm on board with catgirls though so does that count? D:
20-09-2018T23:44:22,Mihari,Yes
20-09-2018T23:44:23,ZRO4825,Catgirls are definitely &lt;3
20-09-2018T23:44:24,SageSaga,it does count
20-09-2018T23:44:50,unsteddyphoenix,catgirls are the furry gateway drug
20-09-2018T23:44:52,unsteddyphoenix,So...kinda?
20-09-2018T23:44:57,unsteddyphoenix,Sorta?
20-09-2018T23:45:09,SageSaga,how do you feel about Dark Elves?
20-09-2018T23:45:15,Mihari,You'd a stellar job drawing Nyna his nekomata with itty bitties
20-09-2018T23:45:19,ZRO4825,"I look at catgirls as the best of both worlds. Best fuzzy parts of anthros, combined with the nice smooth awesome points of humans. &lt;3"
20-09-2018T23:45:21,unsteddyphoenix,Have you heard of the high elves?
20-09-2018T23:45:39,skimike,Succubelfdemonkitty.
20-09-2018T23:45:39,Accelo,Elves are fine too.
20-09-2018T23:45:42,skimike,It's a thing.
20-09-2018T23:46:01,unsteddyphoenix,That dude kills me lmao
20-09-2018T23:46:12,unsteddyphoenix,I wish he did more of those
20-09-2018T23:46:14,SageSaga,Now how about Catgirl x Dark Elf?
20-09-2018T23:46:32,Deciem,where's that furry-ness meter of anime?
20-09-2018T23:46:37,Accelo,:ptv-shipit:

20-09-2018T23:47:18,unsteddyphoenix,Youre streaming sunday right?
20-09-2018T23:47:58,SageSaga,((Of course im gonna plug stuff on my own stream))
20-09-2018T23:50:06,skimike,Catgirl + darkelf sounds like win to me.  It's fine even when they have both sets of ears.
20-09-2018T23:50:19,unsteddyphoenix,Cool~ good to hear
20-09-2018T23:50:42,SageSaga,not catgirl/Darkelf - Catgirl x Darkelf
20-09-2018T23:51:09,sunblaze,^sexy plot incoming :D
20-09-2018T23:51:11,skimike,I'm not sure I can do that kind of math.
20-09-2018T23:51:28,skimike,The product of catgirl x dark elf is the inverse of demon dog.
20-09-2018T23:51:50,unsteddyphoenix,Well she does look like a snacc
20-09-2018T23:51:55,ZRO4825,The product of catgirl x Dark Elf is sexy fun times that don't produce children.
20-09-2018T23:52:06,ZRO4825,:thinking: Unless the magic in that game got weird.
20-09-2018T23:52:14,sunblaze,but MAGIC!
20-09-2018T23:52:17,SageSaga,ah- i should refine the equation
20-09-2018T23:52:24,SageSaga,Catgirl x Darkelf Girl
20-09-2018T23:52:47,unsteddyphoenix,Good good...we're getting closer.
