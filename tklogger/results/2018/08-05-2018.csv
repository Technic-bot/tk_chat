08-05-2018T00:17:30,Vatruvius,:ptv-sleepy: I am so tired. Both physically and mentally. I think all this finals studying and projects are catching up with me.
08-05-2018T00:44:56,Vatruvius,Good night to anyone still on and checking the chat
08-05-2018T00:45:00,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
08-05-2018T10:24:27,Vatruvius,I am just not getting any good sleep...:ptv-sleepy:
08-05-2018T10:24:53,Vatruvius,E-gasp...Bgr is not online! :ptv-shock:
08-05-2018T10:24:56,Vatruvius,:P
08-05-2018T11:45:18,Bgrmystr2,Just got woken up by the streamer going live sound
08-05-2018T11:45:29,Bgrmystr2,and yeah the chat disconnected on me
08-05-2018T11:45:38,Bgrmystr2,perma-reconnecting loop as usual
08-05-2018T11:46:07,Bgrmystr2,"Damn, the new design is trash, isn't it?"
08-05-2018T11:46:10,Bgrmystr2,such a downgrade
08-05-2018T11:46:16,BadFoMo,Yep.
08-05-2018T11:46:33,Bgrmystr2,Pity
08-05-2018T11:47:00,Bgrmystr2,the old one was sleek and stylish.. this one looks like it never even finished beta
08-05-2018T11:50:27,BadFoMo,"Why do they feel like they need to change ALL the things? Just fix the bugs and maybe split options into more refined options/add more options, and that's it."
08-05-2018T11:51:12,Bgrmystr2,Like we needed more garbage bars in front of the stream window
08-05-2018T11:51:16,Bgrmystr2,-_-
08-05-2018T11:53:13,Bgrmystr2,"anycase, gonna grab somethin to drink and go back to sleep"
08-05-2018T11:53:46,Bgrmystr2,RIP site:ptv-unimpressed:
08-05-2018T12:21:02,Vatruvius,"I kinda like it, looks like Tom's offline image is working now."
08-05-2018T12:21:18,Vatruvius,"Going to make some breakfast, be back later."
08-05-2018T14:57:34,Bgrmystr2,"The colors and stuff seem okay, but it's overall bad. If this was the original design and always had been, it's not.. bad.. but it's worse than what we had"
08-05-2018T14:58:20,Bgrmystr2,"the whole point of a UI is to be minimalistic. Drag user focus to the main reason why they're here, the stream and the chat :/"
08-05-2018T14:59:09,Bgrmystr2,they've just added two bars that take away from the stream size itself that which do not add to the experience in any way
08-05-2018T14:59:49,Bgrmystr2,"We already had all the buttons that existed besides the go live button, which isn't even on the new bar they added.."
08-05-2018T15:00:32,Bgrmystr2,The only thing they've done is moved a bunch of things to two bars above and below the stream to make the stream size smaller.
08-05-2018T15:00:41,Bgrmystr2,"and that's bad, not good"
08-05-2018T15:01:02,Bgrmystr2,increasing clutter is never a good thing :/
08-05-2018T15:03:49,Bgrmystr2,:rolling_eyes: Makes me wonder if they have a QA department for UI
08-05-2018T15:04:24,Bgrmystr2,"I guess most companies don't, considering how bad UIs are getting for so many programs"
08-05-2018T15:09:41,Bgrmystr2,"also, the bar below the stream which has nothing of value on it.. is actually in front of the stream window. You can see it cover up the bottom when zooming in/out the page"
08-05-2018T15:45:24,zolstarym,The character limit seems to be gone and the past videos popup thing is gone so at least it is better than yesterday
08-05-2018T15:46:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I found $20 on the roadside :ctwokinds-adiracoin:
08-05-2018T15:50:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"But with the update, it’s just made everything smaller. They finally fixed so the chat doesn’t sit on the userlist when you swap menus"
08-05-2018T15:51:02,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Did it ever do that?
08-05-2018T15:51:05,SpazztasticKiwi,And all the menus are actually visible and usable
08-05-2018T15:51:10,SpazztasticKiwi,It did for me
08-05-2018T15:51:19,Bgrmystr2,"Never happened to be, that's strange"
08-05-2018T15:51:24,Bgrmystr2,me* ffs
08-05-2018T15:52:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Made whispering and checking who was available hard
08-05-2018T15:52:29,Bgrmystr2,I just clicked the person's name who I was whispering in the chat
08-05-2018T15:52:40,Bgrmystr2,cuz they didn't bother to save the name you were whispering after you pressed enter..
08-05-2018T15:53:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"And for me the usernames are a bit larger, and in bold"
08-05-2018T15:53:28,Bgrmystr2,"yeh they're a bit harder to read now, the letters blend into themselves and others"
08-05-2018T15:53:37,Bgrmystr2,Not a fan
08-05-2018T16:21:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And there’s also no more time stamps and it takes forever to reload when you leave
08-05-2018T16:42:02,Bgrmystr2,eh? not for me
08-05-2018T16:42:06,Bgrmystr2,I have timestamps still
08-05-2018T16:42:23,Bgrmystr2,they're still fuckin wrong as hell :ptv-unimpressed:
08-05-2018T16:42:33,Bgrmystr2,nice to see nothing ever changes
08-05-2018T17:08:08,Vatruvius,"The user list being covered by chat is on the mobile app Bgr, so that is fixed. And I have timestamps enabled on the app so check your settings Kiwi."
08-05-2018T17:10:13,Vatruvius,It is nice that most of the things on tge mobile app are in working order. Before it was barely operable.
08-05-2018T17:10:22,Vatruvius,the
08-05-2018T17:11:50,Vatruvius,And after my 45 minute commute I have turned in my assignments and get to commute back home after just 20 minutes. :ptv-unimpressed:
08-05-2018T17:18:36,Bgrmystr2,"I doubt the fixes for the app needed the UI change, though"
08-05-2018T17:18:42,Bgrmystr2,but it's good that the app is working
08-05-2018T17:18:51,Bgrmystr2,"well, moreso than it was"
08-05-2018T17:25:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Why is that a thing you have to enable
08-05-2018T17:26:12,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: not everyone likes timestamps
08-05-2018T17:26:38,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I'd rather them on, but giving the option is always the best"
08-05-2018T17:27:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe the streams will actually work on the app now
08-05-2018T17:28:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Doubt it, but there’s hope"
08-05-2018T18:01:23,Vatruvius,^We can only hope Kiwi.
08-05-2018T18:06:03,Vatruvius,Is Tom going to stream on Mother's Day?
08-05-2018T18:33:00,SpazztasticKiwi,That depends on if his mom suckers him into something
08-05-2018T18:33:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Well maybe not “suckers”
08-05-2018T18:34:00,Vatruvius,I see.
08-05-2018T18:37:00,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ll just have to see. Or ask next time he’s on
08-05-2018T18:39:33,Vatruvius,"Yeah, he has been off for a while."
08-05-2018T18:46:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Only about a day so far. Probably finishing those hedges
08-05-2018T18:57:29,Vatruvius,Is he hedge trimming?
08-05-2018T19:02:34,SpazztasticKiwi,He mentioned that was what he was doing earlier the other day and that’s why he didn’t do the makeup stream
08-05-2018T19:03:33,Vatruvius,I see.
08-05-2018T19:03:48,Vatruvius,"A reasonable excuse, I will let it pass this one time..."
08-05-2018T19:04:01,Vatruvius,:ptv-hearts:
08-05-2018T19:24:56,CrRAR,"Oh nice, Flora's back."
08-05-2018T19:25:18,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, she is. Unfortunately, the bottom of the image is covered"
08-05-2018T19:31:35,Vatruvius,"I think the image may have to be rescaled, but I am not sure."
08-05-2018T19:37:45,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, though it depends on the window size."
08-05-2018T19:38:01,CrRAR,Damn picarto
08-05-2018T19:40:23,Vatruvius,Let my check my browser.
08-05-2018T19:41:30,Vatruvius,The image loads normally for me on my main browser. Looks just as it did before.
08-05-2018T19:41:45,Vatruvius,But I think it depends on how big your chat window is.
08-05-2018T19:41:57,CrRAR,"yeah, the borders adapt funkily now."
08-05-2018T19:42:18,Bgrmystr2,"I am running the chat at the smallest size, which was default when I reloaded the page"
08-05-2018T19:42:23,Bgrmystr2,at a standard 1080p resolution
08-05-2018T19:42:31,Bgrmystr2,and her foot is cut off at the bottom
08-05-2018T19:42:39,Bgrmystr2,so they definitely fucked it up
08-05-2018T19:42:51,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, no question"
08-05-2018T19:43:06,CrRAR,If I have it full screen her foot is cut off.
08-05-2018T19:43:18,CrRAR,and her knee
08-05-2018T19:43:27,Bgrmystr2,yeah
08-05-2018T19:43:51,Bgrmystr2,"her knee is just above the cutoff for me, slightly"
08-05-2018T19:44:21,CrRAR,"If I have it windowed and more square she's all there... but the narrower the more the left/right gets squashed,"
08-05-2018T19:44:26,CrRAR,yeah
08-05-2018T19:44:53,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, it's only because they put these stupid bars at the top and bottom of the screen and squish the stream window itself"
08-05-2018T19:45:02,Bgrmystr2,making it smaller
08-05-2018T19:45:07,Bgrmystr2,which fucks with the resolution sizes
08-05-2018T19:45:31,CrRAR,PRAISE BARS
08-05-2018T19:45:39,CrRAR,(that's totally what we're here to see)
08-05-2018T19:45:52,Bgrmystr2,I will not. :ptv-unimpressed:
08-05-2018T19:45:56,Bgrmystr2,Bars can die
08-05-2018T19:46:02,Bgrmystr2,"these two, anyway"
08-05-2018T19:46:32,CrRAR,I know what happened to GUI's becoming more... out of the way.
08-05-2018T19:47:08,Bgrmystr2,That's the purpose of them. To be as minimal as possible while providing all the necessary information and tools
08-05-2018T19:47:17,CrRAR,"Web 1.0 is fighting back it seems,"
08-05-2018T19:47:19,Bgrmystr2,so your focus is the content and not on the UI itself :/
08-05-2018T19:47:30,CrRAR,yeah
08-05-2018T19:47:50,Bgrmystr2,This was a big step backwards
08-05-2018T19:48:02,Bgrmystr2,:/
08-05-2018T19:48:23,CrRAR,"At least the Videos button today isn's ""Hey! Listen!""ing constantly."
08-05-2018T19:49:05,CrRAR,"Also, the recordings history went further back before right?"
08-05-2018T19:49:05,Bgrmystr2,by the time the chat forced my client to disconnect permanantly from the chat and die.. that wasn't an issue
08-05-2018T19:49:13,CrRAR,haha
08-05-2018T19:49:19,CrRAR,it was inevitable
08-05-2018T19:49:21,Bgrmystr2,"so I missed that, thankfully :v"
08-05-2018T19:49:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah it was
08-05-2018T19:49:34,Vatruvius,So much chat!
08-05-2018T19:49:37,Vatruvius,Agh!
08-05-2018T19:49:41,Vatruvius,Must...catch...up!
08-05-2018T19:49:42,Bgrmystr2,I was gonna have to restart my browswer by Friday night anyway..
08-05-2018T19:49:51,Bgrmystr2,"Wb Vatru, take your time :)"
08-05-2018T19:53:25,unsteddyphoenix,Did they make the text brighter?
08-05-2018T19:53:56,Bgrmystr2,"from.. last night when they implemented it? By the look of the screenshot I was given, it does seem like it"
08-05-2018T19:54:18,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. That was fast.
08-05-2018T19:54:21,Vatruvius,"Yeah, it is brighter."
08-05-2018T19:54:29,Vatruvius,And caught up at last.
08-05-2018T19:54:35,CrRAR,whooptiidoo
08-05-2018T19:54:39,Bgrmystr2,xD
08-05-2018T19:54:42,unsteddyphoenix,Well that was my main annoyance tbh lol
08-05-2018T19:54:50,CrRAR,Oh
08-05-2018T19:54:50,unsteddyphoenix,That and the videos popup thing
08-05-2018T19:54:59,CrRAR,They killed the character counter
08-05-2018T19:55:06,CrRAR,yeah
08-05-2018T19:55:16,Bgrmystr2,my biggest annoyance was the addition of empty space that block tom's stream
08-05-2018T19:55:30,Bgrmystr2,Everything else eh
08-05-2018T19:56:09,Bgrmystr2,"I actually tried to see what it would look like if I used Ublock to block some of the elements, but the UI functions in such a way that it doesn't make the streaming window any bigger.."
08-05-2018T19:56:45,Bgrmystr2,they're coded specifically to block part of the window and automatically adjust to do so
08-05-2018T19:56:52,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:T
08-05-2018T20:15:03,Vatruvius,For mine I am not getting any of this reduced or blocked stream window...so I do not know what your guys are talking about.
08-05-2018T20:16:29,CrRAR,It just depends on your screen res/aspect ratio
08-05-2018T20:16:55,Bgrmystr2,Probably because you don't have a before/after comparison Vatru.
08-05-2018T20:16:59,Bgrmystr2,Here sec
08-05-2018T20:17:22,Bgrmystr2,This is what it looked like for me before. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/443565684362838036/firefox_2018-05-08_19-11-29.png
08-05-2018T20:17:36,Bgrmystr2,And this is after https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/443944436976582666/firefox_2018-05-09_20-16-18.png
08-05-2018T20:18:22,Bgrmystr2,There's a huge bar above and below the stream image on the new one that blocks the streaming window
08-05-2018T20:18:36,Bgrmystr2,you can see the difference
08-05-2018T20:19:28,CrRAR,"yeah the wider aspect your screen the more the bottom gets cut off. That's why mine's missing the knee too, I have a 21:9."
08-05-2018T20:19:48,CrRAR,If I keep it windowed at 2/3s the screen it's okay.
08-05-2018T20:20:05,Bgrmystr2,"1080p is 16:9, so yeh, that's why the foot is cut off for me but her knee isn't"
08-05-2018T20:20:08,CrRAR,"I wonder how it looks on a 16:10, that might be a sweet spot."
08-05-2018T20:20:26,Bgrmystr2,"dunno, but that's not a very widespread resolution"
08-05-2018T20:20:36,Bgrmystr2,so I'm not sure why they would pick that as a sweet spot
08-05-2018T20:20:36,CrRAR,Yeah just a tad taller.
08-05-2018T20:20:45,CrRAR,1920x1200
08-05-2018T20:20:54,Bgrmystr2,probably
08-05-2018T20:20:57,CrRAR,Might actually be perfect.
08-05-2018T20:21:05,Vatruvius,More chat! Agh!
08-05-2018T20:21:08,Bgrmystr2,can't test it myself lol
08-05-2018T20:21:13,CrRAR,I wonder if the devs are developing exclusively on 16:10 XD
08-05-2018T20:21:23,CrRAR,"""Hey! Works for us!"""
08-05-2018T20:21:24,Bgrmystr2,"it might be, Cr"
08-05-2018T20:21:26,CrRAR,XD
08-05-2018T20:21:43,Bgrmystr2,"anything that works for them won't possibly look fucking horribad for anyone else, right? Right? :V"
08-05-2018T20:21:51,CrRAR,indeed
08-05-2018T20:22:02,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's how anything works...
08-05-2018T20:22:37,CrRAR,I'll hook up my 16:10 to see how it looks
08-05-2018T20:23:25,Bgrmystr2,everything I have is 16:9 or 4:3 I believe
08-05-2018T20:25:30,Vatruvius,"Try enlarging the chat window, you can resize it now. Works fine for me. If you resize it the resolution will adjust showing more or less depending on how you resize the chat window."
08-05-2018T20:25:56,Bgrmystr2,"actually, it may be 5:4 that I have, 1280x1024"
08-05-2018T20:26:09,Bgrmystr2,for a couple monitors I don't use
08-05-2018T20:26:20,Bgrmystr2,"also, I'm not trying to make the stream window smaller, Vatru"
08-05-2018T20:26:26,Bgrmystr2,that's going backwards
08-05-2018T20:26:32,Bgrmystr2,I'm trying to make the stream window bigger
08-05-2018T20:26:48,Bgrmystr2,which is the whole point I'm trying to make xD
08-05-2018T20:27:03,Bgrmystr2,"also, you could always resize the chat window"
08-05-2018T20:27:19,Bgrmystr2,"ever since I joined, if I recall correctly, like two years ago"
08-05-2018T20:27:26,Bgrmystr2,so probably before that as well
08-05-2018T20:28:59,CrRAR,We may have cracked the code boys:
08-05-2018T20:29:05,CrRAR,https://i.imgur.com/z4WRv2e.jpg
08-05-2018T20:29:08,CrRAR,on a 1920x1200
08-05-2018T20:29:19,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
08-05-2018T20:29:27,Bgrmystr2,"yup, looks about right then"
08-05-2018T20:30:00,Bgrmystr2,they're designing the UI around a specific resolution instead of around variable resolution which it used to be
08-05-2018T20:30:15,Bgrmystr2,"pity, that. Only moving backwards."
08-05-2018T20:30:23,CrRAR,yeah lol
08-05-2018T20:30:41,CrRAR,If I do a full screen on that res still looks good too.
08-05-2018T20:31:33,CrRAR,"I'm pissed though too because on my 21:9 it used to fit fantastically if I fullscreened the browser and adjusted the chat just right,"
08-05-2018T20:32:21,CrRAR,I can kinda sill do that but the chat has to be like 1/3rd the screen. pfhh
08-05-2018T20:32:39,Bgrmystr2,It's never not fit no matter what size I had because Picarto never had anything blocking the stream video
08-05-2018T20:32:56,Bgrmystr2,"if I made it smaller, the video just resized and everything resized around it"
08-05-2018T20:33:49,Bgrmystr2,"the video was the focus point, there wasn't anything that changed the size of the video or blocked it beyond the chat window which you could close or open to many different widths"
08-05-2018T20:34:46,Bgrmystr2,"I can't scroll down the entire screen below the bar above the stream, or I'd do so"
08-05-2018T20:35:04,Bgrmystr2,and it wouldn't matter cuz the bar under the stream blocks part of it cuz of the ui implementation
08-05-2018T20:35:19,Bgrmystr2,Super sad
08-05-2018T20:35:20,CrRAR,yeah
08-05-2018T20:35:40,CrRAR,They shouldn't have bezeled it like they did.
08-05-2018T20:37:12,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad: I need to get somethin to eat
08-05-2018T20:37:16,Bgrmystr2,but I don't wanna.
08-05-2018T20:43:52,Vatruvius,I feel like when the redesigned the UI the used a new application to remake the webpage or something so they are still learning it and did not realize that the way they did it has this issue.
08-05-2018T20:43:59,Vatruvius,Best case scenario.
08-05-2018T20:51:48,Bgrmystr2,hmmm? I would consider that a problem if it passed QA
08-05-2018T20:51:58,Bgrmystr2,Though I don't know if they /have/ QA
08-05-2018T20:52:05,Bgrmystr2,..which is a problem in and of itself xD
08-05-2018T20:53:40,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah if all they have are 16:10 resolutions, they could possibly not have any issue, but they can't be that bad off to not realize how the site would react to different resolutions.."
08-05-2018T20:53:53,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
08-05-2018T20:56:35,Vatruvius,I am sure they are working to resolve any issues with the new UI.
08-05-2018T20:56:43,Vatruvius,I bet their email is flooded right now.
