25-03-2018T00:21:23,Bigboi182,"Yeah, not gonna bathe you in praise bro."
25-03-2018T00:21:35,DarthRexKing,&gt;w&gt;
25-03-2018T00:21:39,Bigboi182,Especially since you already had a shower.
25-03-2018T00:21:54,Bigboi182,"Hey, DRK."
25-03-2018T00:22:04,Bigboi182,Glad to see you're still here.
25-03-2018T00:22:22,Bigboi182,"Wait, Vat, what time is it where you are."

25-03-2018T00:25:04,Vatruvius,Are you in Copenhagen @Terramaster20209?
25-03-2018T00:25:17,Terramaster20209,Żywiec in poland
25-03-2018T00:25:20,Bigboi182,"damn, pretty early for you Terra..."

25-03-2018T00:25:32,Bigboi182,Plus you don't have Easter break...
25-03-2018T00:25:47,Vatruvius,"Curse you Google, you failed me! :ptv-angry:"
25-03-2018T00:25:54,Terramaster20209,XD
25-03-2018T00:26:15,Bigboi182,I guess vat's in Cali or something...
25-03-2018T00:26:25,Vatruvius,Yup! :ptv-excited:
25-03-2018T00:26:26,Terramaster20209,ugh coffee without milk is horrible
25-03-2018T00:26:52,Vatruvius,I don't drink coffee...because I am AWESOME!
25-03-2018T00:26:53,Bigboi182,It's 1:26 AM here...
25-03-2018T00:27:09,Bigboi182,I just had sugary cornflakes...
25-03-2018T00:27:10,Vatruvius,You in the east Bigboi
25-03-2018T00:27:16,Bigboi182,yep
25-03-2018T00:27:26,Terramaster20209,im in i think it's 8tg grade in america ?
25-03-2018T00:27:26,Bigboi182,in the Caribbean.
25-03-2018T00:27:35,Terramaster20209,8th
25-03-2018T00:27:46,Bigboi182,And I'm fighting off sleep.
25-03-2018T00:27:48,Vatruvius,I rather like living here in the west...Tom's streams never go super late for me. :D
25-03-2018T00:27:55,Terramaster20209,"oh nice Bigboy, how is it there ?"
25-03-2018T00:28:04,Bigboi182,Hot.
25-03-2018T00:28:06,Bigboi182,Hot.
25-03-2018T00:28:11,Bigboi182,and Still hot.
25-03-2018T00:28:18,Bigboi182,So Fine.
25-03-2018T00:29:00,Bigboi182,Basically everything's fine here
25-03-2018T00:29:41,Terramaster20209,"well in poland there pollution in winter, not that cold but it tends to be hot in the summer"
25-03-2018T00:29:56,Bigboi182,We're just hoping to god the US doesn't do anything stupid...
25-03-2018T00:30:05,Bigboi182,cause we're RIGHT THERE.
25-03-2018T00:30:35,Vatruvius,"Speak for yourself @Bigboi182, I am in the US!"
25-03-2018T00:30:39,Terramaster20209,my town has the biggest air pollution in europe :ptv-angry:
25-03-2018T00:30:44,Vatruvius,I am hoping we don't do anything stupid!
25-03-2018T00:31:09,Terramaster20209,well gotta go cya o/
25-03-2018T00:31:15,Vatruvius,I bet there are a fair amount of cities here in the US that beat you Terra
25-03-2018T00:31:17,Bigboi182,"I know Vat, but you're not in the part where all the crazy sh*t happens..."
25-03-2018T00:31:37,Terramaster20209,"trust me vat, no"
25-03-2018T00:32:05,Bigboi182,"Besides, If a nuclear warhead happens, It'll be worse for us than you (as it stands...)"
25-03-2018T00:32:20,Vatruvius,Yeah...but that does not make me feel better. At least here in Cali even Trump hates how nice we are! :D
25-03-2018T00:32:22,Terramaster20209,depends if russia will attack us
25-03-2018T00:32:29,Bigboi182,Damn.
25-03-2018T00:32:49,Vatruvius,Nay...North Korea will fire first.
25-03-2018T00:32:51,Terramaster20209,"vat, you know the pollution scale, right ?"
25-03-2018T00:33:11,Vatruvius,Not really...that or it has been too long for me to recall.
25-03-2018T00:33:28,Terramaster20209,above 100 is polluted
25-03-2018T00:33:39,Terramaster20209,well we had 1600 something
25-03-2018T00:34:22,Bigboi182,My internet's on the frince again..
25-03-2018T00:34:39,Bigboi182,And Idk why...
25-03-2018T00:34:49,Terramaster20209,well the cya o/ have a nice day
25-03-2018T00:35:19,Vatruvius,Bye...I do not know how that is possible Terra...you should be growing a third limb or something.
25-03-2018T00:37:02,Vatruvius,Still...the US is #2 most polluted country in the world so. Pollution sucks but I don't see why we have to be 2nd...just stop you multi-trillion dollar gas corps!
25-03-2018T00:39:47,Bgrmystr2,"probably polluted physically, with trash"
25-03-2018T00:39:51,Bgrmystr2,but not by air
25-03-2018T00:40:11,Bgrmystr2,"If China doesn't have us beat for the #1 spot, I'd be severely disappoint"
25-03-2018T00:40:25,Bgrmystr2,cuz that study has no fucking idea
25-03-2018T00:40:56,Bigboi182,"Well gee, Bgr came back..."
25-03-2018T00:41:07,Bgrmystr2,I never left? :thinking:
25-03-2018T00:41:17,TheBeckoner,I however have come back.
25-03-2018T00:41:25,Bgrmystr2,welcome beck :v
25-03-2018T00:41:38,TheBeckoner,Hullo beejee
25-03-2018T00:41:49,TorqueEmUp,#2 most polluted? I don't even think we are even close to #2 tbh
25-03-2018T00:41:52,Bgrmystr2,are you glad to be beck? :P
25-03-2018T00:41:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah would agree w/ you on that Torque
25-03-2018T00:42:14,Bgrmystr2,there's some seriously polluted countries out there
25-03-2018T00:42:15,TheBeckoner,bean beck is gud
25-03-2018T00:42:17,TorqueEmUp,Definitely not saying we are anywhere near the cleanest either
25-03-2018T00:42:23,Bgrmystr2,well course not
25-03-2018T00:42:29,Bigboi182,So everyone decides to show up at 1:42 AM?
25-03-2018T00:42:31,Bgrmystr2,some of our cities are terribl
25-03-2018T00:42:32,Bgrmystr2,e
25-03-2018T00:42:38,Bigboi182,Or whatever time...
25-03-2018T00:42:44,Bgrmystr2,not really everyone just showing up now
25-03-2018T00:42:52,Bgrmystr2,it's just ppl showing up cuz there's conversation
25-03-2018T00:43:10,Bgrmystr2,"the people you see at this time, for the most part, are the people that live here."
25-03-2018T00:43:12,Bgrmystr2,People like me.
25-03-2018T00:43:17,Bigboi182,So you were just lurking in the shadows?
25-03-2018T00:43:32,Bigboi182,Like I did a couple hours back?
25-03-2018T00:43:34,TorqueEmUp,Even Tom is still lurking lol
25-03-2018T00:43:40,Bgrmystr2,That's my not-secret. I'm always lurking. :ptv-condescending:
25-03-2018T00:43:45,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
25-03-2018T00:43:51,Bgrmystr2,ayy
25-03-2018T00:44:02,Bigboi182,God dammnit I knew he was here.
25-03-2018T00:44:10,Bgrmystr2,He is always there.
25-03-2018T00:44:25,Bigboi182,Not Always.
25-03-2018T00:44:35,Bgrmystr2,"always watching, Wazowski..."
25-03-2018T00:45:30,Vatruvius,"The US is the 2nd largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. That is what I meant by polluted, we were talking about air quality. China takes #1 in this category."
25-03-2018T00:46:03,Bigboi182,But quite often.
25-03-2018T00:46:06,Vatruvius,"As for trash, chemicals, physical pollutants, etc. I am sure we are much lower."
25-03-2018T00:46:23,Bigboi182,China?
25-03-2018T00:46:37,Bigboi182,I didn't know that...
25-03-2018T00:46:43,Bgrmystr2,oooh yeah okay Vatru yeah that makes sense
25-03-2018T00:46:44,TorqueEmUp,I still wonder how people measure this crap
25-03-2018T00:46:56,Bigboi182,"Then again, I don't take Ecology so..."
25-03-2018T00:47:24,Bgrmystr2,"air quality is measured by particles of contaminates in the atmosphere, far as I recall"
25-03-2018T00:47:46,Bgrmystr2,"the denser it is, the more likely that life will die :c"
25-03-2018T00:48:10,Bgrmystr2,or at least severely suffer
25-03-2018T00:50:16,Bigboi182,The more you know.
25-03-2018T00:50:26,TorqueEmUp,"Still don't buy it, for all we know they could have taken those readings near a coal burning powerplant for all we know. :P"
25-03-2018T00:50:43,Bigboi182,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD6qtc2_AQA
25-03-2018T00:50:57,TorqueEmUp,Country is more than just a few spots to pull data from
25-03-2018T00:51:14,Bgrmystr2,"naw, it's pretty obvious what cities are polluted just by being there"
25-03-2018T00:51:57,TorqueEmUp,City =/= Country
25-03-2018T00:52:13,Vatruvius,This is true...unfiltered contaminates from activities like coal burning has severe effects on living organisms.
25-03-2018T00:52:28,TorqueEmUp,"Yes there are polluted cities in the states, I don't deny that"
25-03-2018T00:52:50,TorqueEmUp,But you can't say India by scale doesn't pollute more than we do.
25-03-2018T00:52:55,Bgrmystr2,"you have to survey many cities, Torque.. many of them. And compare them on an average to cities of other countries"
25-03-2018T00:53:03,Bgrmystr2,the US is absolutely huge
25-03-2018T00:53:03,TorqueEmUp,We are a massive country
25-03-2018T00:53:07,Bgrmystr2,so yeah
25-03-2018T00:53:33,Vatruvius,"The data I am talking about takes the average of the entire country including production sites, coal burning, cities, everything. This information is provided to the UN to make decisions that is best for everyone."
25-03-2018T00:54:11,Bgrmystr2,'best for everyone' in b4 they just kill everyone but themselves in nuclear war
25-03-2018T00:54:18,Bgrmystr2,and then all problems are solved.
25-03-2018T00:54:19,TorqueEmUp,"Yet all our best efforts with advancing pollution control on cars, it hasn't done a damn thing"
25-03-2018T00:54:48,Bgrmystr2,"electric cars do not pollute the atmosphere from combustion engines, Torque"
25-03-2018T00:54:57,Vatruvius,It is sad really that we one of if not the world power and still produce almost as much pollution as China which is just now ramping up its production like we did during the industrial revolution.
25-03-2018T00:54:58,Bgrmystr2,I'd consider that pretty successful
25-03-2018T00:55:23,Bgrmystr2,Electric cars are expanding rapidly too
25-03-2018T00:55:29,TorqueEmUp,Mining needed to create the batteries in turn make electric cars more harmful to the enviroment.
25-03-2018T00:55:37,Vatruvius,We still burn too much coal to get power...
25-03-2018T00:55:44,TorqueEmUp,plus the added strain on coal power plants
25-03-2018T00:55:57,Bgrmystr2,That's questionable at best Torque
25-03-2018T00:56:18,Bgrmystr2,"the batteries are not nuclear, man"
25-03-2018T00:56:49,TorqueEmUp,Also look at those unregulated barges used to ship around all that material to different countries before the batteries are all put together
25-03-2018T00:57:17,Bgrmystr2,"and you can recycle batteries by taking their components, melting them down, and making new batteries with them"
25-03-2018T00:57:24,Bgrmystr2,instead of needing to mine more resources
25-03-2018T00:57:26,Vatruvius,I do not think the process of mining the materials necessary to make the batteries and actually make them is equal to that of combustion vehicles. It is a net loss in air pollution per vehical.
25-03-2018T00:57:33,Vatruvius,vehicle*
25-03-2018T00:58:27,TorqueEmUp,We'll see
25-03-2018T00:59:03,Vatruvius,"In the US, there is a huge push for companies to get the materials from good/clean sources. Meaning...not from child labor places, from more restricted countries, etc."
25-03-2018T00:59:18,TorqueEmUp,"I am not saying don't try, I am just saying atm, our best efforts are barely scratching the surface."
25-03-2018T00:59:26,Vatruvius,Countries with more restrictions I should say...
25-03-2018T00:59:54,Vatruvius,I will admit our best effects are way below sub-par. We can do so much better.
25-03-2018T01:00:13,TorqueEmUp,"I am not just saying us, the whole world"
25-03-2018T01:00:21,Vatruvius,We can do so much more.* What has happened to my grammer?
25-03-2018T01:00:29,Vatruvius,Yup...I agree.
25-03-2018T01:01:12,TorqueEmUp,We've already set us up for something that we will be never able to reverse.
25-03-2018T01:01:18,TorqueEmUp,it's only going to get worse and worse
25-03-2018T01:01:26,TorqueEmUp,all we can do is slow it down a little
25-03-2018T01:01:32,Vatruvius,"This is why I am upset Trump pulled us out of the Paris thing. ""America First,"" because that is not at all selfish."
25-03-2018T01:02:57,Vatruvius,"We have not yet reached that threshold of no return, but we are close. We have a good 10-20 years before the world gets caught up in resolving disaster after disaster."
25-03-2018T01:03:29,Vatruvius,At that point we are lost...each economy will fall and the world will be in a very low place.
25-03-2018T01:03:50,TorqueEmUp,There will be a tipping point where shit will eventually get done.
25-03-2018T01:03:55,Bgrmystr2,"from what I saw of that paris deal thing, we'd get shit on by that anyway"
25-03-2018T01:04:01,Vatruvius,But I prefer to be optimistic and hope that there is still time to do something and make it right.
25-03-2018T01:04:04,Bgrmystr2,so it wasn't even remotely good for u
25-03-2018T01:04:08,Bgrmystr2,us*
25-03-2018T01:05:16,Vatruvius,"All the Paris deal did was motivate each country to meet goals of reducing air pollution. There were no requirements, no punishments, nothing. Just a unified motivator saying that we will all work together to reducing air pollution."
25-03-2018T01:05:32,Bgrmystr2,definitely not what I've read about it
25-03-2018T01:05:51,Vatruvius,Depends...what were your sources/where did you read about it?
25-03-2018T01:06:25,Bgrmystr2,"It was way back, when it was really big, drudge report had it all up big text and shit"
25-03-2018T01:07:02,Bgrmystr2,"lotta sites were throwing shit back and forth, both good and bad, lotta legal mumbo jumbo"
25-03-2018T01:07:23,TorqueEmUp,"Basically can't believe anything any news agency has to say, someone is always going to twist it in their favor."
25-03-2018T01:07:29,Bgrmystr2,unfortunately I don't have the links for that since it was so long ago
25-03-2018T01:07:31,Bigboi182,Ok.. Remember when I said I was Fighting sleep Vat?
25-03-2018T01:07:58,Bigboi182,I'm thiiis close to giving up...
25-03-2018T01:08:09,Bgrmystr2,"normal humans do that too, Torque. Does that mean we shouldn't trust anyone? There's gotta be a line somewhere lol"
25-03-2018T01:08:27,Bigboi182,"I just neesd one more comment from Tom, and I'll be good."
25-03-2018T01:08:32,Vatruvius,"Drudge Report's description of itself is that it is a right wing, conservative news website. In other words, heavy bias. I prefer the New York Times and the Washington Post. Both provide good information and tend to keep most biases out."
25-03-2018T01:08:47,Bigboi182,TOOOOOM! Where you at?
25-03-2018T01:08:48,Vatruvius,"If not, they do not leave out the other side in their posts/articles."
25-03-2018T01:09:39,Bigboi182,"Also, Pollution sucks, We've tried to fix it, nothing's working,  and we're somehow back to the same place."
25-03-2018T01:09:48,Bigboi182,That's my contribution.
25-03-2018T01:10:01,Bigboi182,In other news...
25-03-2018T01:10:15,Bigboi182,"TOOOOM! seriously, where is he?"
25-03-2018T01:10:19,Bgrmystr2,He's hiding
25-03-2018T01:10:21,Vatruvius,It does work...we just did a shit job of trying. Another plus to living in California...the air is the best here even in our huge cities. I still like the forest without the SMOG though.
25-03-2018T01:10:24,Bigboi182,I know what to do.
25-03-2018T01:10:32,Bgrmystr2,"when people need him most, he vanished"
25-03-2018T01:10:35,TheBeckoner,blah blah blah politics. lol. I'm tired. Night y'all.
25-03-2018T01:10:52,Vatruvius,Goodnight Beckoner!
25-03-2018T01:10:55,Bigboi182,"Yo Tom, I still hate White Chocolate!"
25-03-2018T01:11:00,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
25-03-2018T01:11:04,Vatruvius,LoL
25-03-2018T01:11:05,Bgrmystr2,"NYT and Washington post couldn't be more bias if you tried, Vatru."
25-03-2018T01:11:10,Bgrmystr2,just sayin xD
25-03-2018T01:11:17,Bgrmystr2,at least Drudge is honest about it
25-03-2018T01:11:21,Bgrmystr2,give em that
25-03-2018T01:11:30,Bigboi182,That was foolproof.
25-03-2018T01:11:31,Vatruvius,"I could debate you on that Bgr, but I won't right now."
25-03-2018T01:11:44,Bigboi182,It still is foolproof.
25-03-2018T01:11:51,Bgrmystr2,xD Big that was undeniably impressive.
25-03-2018T01:12:02,Bigboi182,"I'mma end on that, that was golden."
25-03-2018T01:12:16,TorqueEmUp,Did your news come from a news agency? Then there is bias
25-03-2018T01:12:33,Vatruvius,"So...if we say ""I hate white chocolate"" in every sentence we are guaranteed a response?"
25-03-2018T01:12:38,Twokinds,I get all my news first hand.
25-03-2018T01:12:48,Bgrmystr2,prolly not vatru
25-03-2018T01:12:53,Twokinds,"If I didn't see it, it doesn't exist."
25-03-2018T01:13:04,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
25-03-2018T01:13:06,Bgrmystr2,Ideal logic
25-03-2018T01:13:14,TorqueEmUp,Good logic to live by
25-03-2018T01:13:16,Bgrmystr2,"sounds legit, I'll buy it"
25-03-2018T01:13:20,Bigboi182,When is the next stream? this week or the coming week?
25-03-2018T01:13:37,Bgrmystr2,"Streams are Fri and sunday, like it says on the chat banner"
25-03-2018T01:13:41,Bgrmystr2,at the top of the chat
25-03-2018T01:13:48,TorqueEmUp,^
25-03-2018T01:13:53,Bigboi182,In terms of the comic stream.
25-03-2018T01:14:01,Bgrmystr2,the comic stream has no scheduled date
25-03-2018T01:14:04,Bigboi182,Actually all of them.
25-03-2018T01:14:06,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-03-2018T01:14:15,Bgrmystr2,"not anymore, anyway"
25-03-2018T01:14:15,TorqueEmUp,Those will be whenever Tom feels like it now. No set date
25-03-2018T01:14:16,Bigboi182,Because this is Holy Week.
25-03-2018T01:14:23,Vatruvius,I have been meaning to ask...iliar account says he is a bot but he is a person because he donates and response some times? Can anyone clarify what a bot account here on Picarto is like in iliar's case?
25-03-2018T01:14:34,Bigboi182,"And you know, Christianism and stuff..."
25-03-2018T01:14:58,Bgrmystr2,"a bot account is an account that picarto recognises that does code shenaniganry, I believe"
25-03-2018T01:15:13,Bgrmystr2,since he automatically gets the streams when they go into recording
25-03-2018T01:15:17,Bgrmystr2,so he can upload them to youtube
25-03-2018T01:15:22,Bigboi182,"So I ask again, Any streams?"
25-03-2018T01:15:39,Bgrmystr2,"that question was already answered, Big"
25-03-2018T01:15:44,Bgrmystr2,"literally, just above"
25-03-2018T01:15:54,Bigboi182,Because it's holy week
25-03-2018T01:16:02,Vatruvius,I see...that makes sense. A bot account Picarto says is okay...that is a good way of handling it.
25-03-2018T01:16:17,Bgrmystr2,"well, it's not saying ok or not ok"
25-03-2018T01:16:20,Bgrmystr2,it's just identifying one
25-03-2018T01:16:21,Bigboi182,Friday and sunday is both Good Friday and Easter Sunday/
25-03-2018T01:16:26,Bigboi182,So...
25-03-2018T01:16:37,Bgrmystr2,Tom's streamed on christmas day before
25-03-2018T01:16:45,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
25-03-2018T01:16:54,Vatruvius,Not everyone is christian or minds the holy dates. They do what they do.
25-03-2018T01:16:58,Bigboi182,Well that killed all my explanations...
25-03-2018T01:17:08,Bgrmystr2,I don't see why either of those days make any significance
25-03-2018T01:17:32,Bigboi182,"Anyway, I'm tired, I have practice at 9, I'm out."
25-03-2018T01:17:35,Bgrmystr2,"neither of those days say ""Thou shalt not stream"" so I mean"
25-03-2018T01:17:37,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-03-2018T01:17:49,Bigboi182,Bye Tom and Co!
25-03-2018T01:17:57,Bgrmystr2,seeya big :v
25-03-2018T01:18:03,Vatruvius,Bye Bigboi!
25-03-2018T01:18:08,Bigboi182,I STILL hate White Chocolate.
25-03-2018T01:18:15,Bgrmystr2,You're STILL not human
25-03-2018T01:18:32,Bigboi182,Damn. Thought it would work.
25-03-2018T01:18:34,unsteddyphoenix,"And the lord said ""thou shall not drawn cute catgirls on this day, for they are the lords days."""
25-03-2018T01:18:42,Bigboi182,Bye anyway.
25-03-2018T01:18:45,Vatruvius,"I am not much of a white chocolate fan either. I neither love nor hate it, I just prefer milk chocolate."
25-03-2018T01:18:49,Bgrmystr2,"If the lord didn't like them, phoenix, they wouldn't exist."
25-03-2018T01:19:13,unsteddyphoenix,"""but Flora is mai waifu"" claimed st. Peter"
25-03-2018T01:19:20,unsteddyphoenix,Then he went to hell the end
25-03-2018T01:19:21,Vatruvius,lol
25-03-2018T01:19:42,TorqueEmUp,"Still got a while but I should start looking into a cheap hotel for Anthrocon, obviously one not on their Hotel listings on the site. :P"
25-03-2018T01:19:52,TorqueEmUp,Since those will be overpriced regardless
25-03-2018T01:20:49,Vatruvius,I have never been to any major event like ComicCon or PAX.
25-03-2018T01:21:10,Vatruvius,If I were to go to one I would want to see Acquisitions Incorporate live.
25-03-2018T01:21:11,TorqueEmUp,"I've been to one con, and that was IndyPopCon"
25-03-2018T01:21:44,Vatruvius,An AI fans here?
25-03-2018T01:21:45,TorqueEmUp,"and the hotel we stay in only had probably 1 other group that was attending the con, and they were vendors. lol"
25-03-2018T01:21:54,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-greetings: @Vatro Yo
25-03-2018T01:22:19,Vatruvius,Nice...I will disregard your comment about NYT and WP being biased... :D
25-03-2018T01:22:40,Bgrmystr2,Good. I will also disregard your disregardance.
25-03-2018T01:22:44,TorqueEmUp,^
25-03-2018T01:23:41,Vatruvius,I had a friend  in Hawaii I met online. He went to some sort of ComicCon there years ago...with he's girlfriend he failed to mention that he got one. How rude of him...he has to tell me these things.
25-03-2018T01:23:58,TorqueEmUp,Can't imagine hotels will be anymore costly in Pittsburgh compared to Indianapolis.
25-03-2018T01:24:23,Vatruvius,Anyway...we were playing online together and he and his girlfriend were playing side by side taking turns. He was young...but she told me that night she would make him a man. Never heard from him since...
25-03-2018T01:24:36,TorqueEmUp,The hotel we stayed in wasn't too far from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
25-03-2018T01:25:07,Vatruvius,I am talking here Torque...shut up! :P
25-03-2018T01:25:23,Bgrmystr2,I WANNA YELL TOO
25-03-2018T01:25:27,Bgrmystr2,I mean
25-03-2018T01:25:28,Bgrmystr2,what
25-03-2018T01:25:29,TorqueEmUp,Sorry don't care about your friends girlfriend.
25-03-2018T01:25:31,TorqueEmUp,:P
25-03-2018T01:25:46,TorqueEmUp,So I am not sorry
25-03-2018T01:26:20,Bgrmystr2,then why u say sorry in the first place
25-03-2018T01:26:26,TorqueEmUp,*shrug*
25-03-2018T01:26:30,Bgrmystr2,don't apologize and then take it back
25-03-2018T01:26:36,Vatruvius,Lol...we were just typing together so he later read that comment and freaked out. Total nerd...he was lucky she thought that was cute otherwise he would have no one.
25-03-2018T01:26:41,TorqueEmUp,It makes it sting more
25-03-2018T01:26:58,Bgrmystr2,"if anything, I'd rather someone not be sorry"
25-03-2018T01:27:10,Bgrmystr2,cuz it just looks bad on them to do that
25-03-2018T01:27:17,Bgrmystr2,"to say sorry, but not mean it"
25-03-2018T01:27:24,Bgrmystr2,that's just lies
25-03-2018T01:27:28,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:v
25-03-2018T01:27:37,TorqueEmUp,People do it all the time
25-03-2018T01:27:44,Bgrmystr2,and those people are lies.
25-03-2018T01:27:46,Bgrmystr2,all of them
25-03-2018T01:27:48,Bgrmystr2,every single one.
25-03-2018T01:27:56,Bgrmystr2,and they're all terrible.
25-03-2018T01:28:09,Vatruvius,I get what you mean Bgr...but I have been burned by people on the internet that I though were close friends so many times that I just do not care about small things like that anymore. To each their own.
25-03-2018T01:28:30,Bgrmystr2,nah vatru. it's the little things that do matter
25-03-2018T01:28:34,Bgrmystr2,they're the only things that do matter
25-03-2018T01:28:44,Vatruvius,In real life though is something entirely different.
25-03-2018T01:28:47,Bgrmystr2,because that's how you find out what kind of person they are
25-03-2018T01:28:54,Bgrmystr2,"and no, it's true there too"
25-03-2018T01:29:06,Bgrmystr2,it just requires a different approach
25-03-2018T01:29:45,Vatruvius,I do care here on the internet too...but I do not know Torque at all beside this little conversation we just had and whatever conversation we had during a stream that I already forgot about.
25-03-2018T01:30:25,Vatruvius,It is the people that I really start to know and like that I take notice. That is how I avoid getting burned again.
25-03-2018T01:30:43,Bgrmystr2,it still happens vatru
25-03-2018T01:30:47,Bgrmystr2,I'm living proof of that.
25-03-2018T01:30:59,Vatruvius,Do you fall into the sincere friend category or the shitty friend category?
25-03-2018T01:31:11,Vatruvius,That is my assessment.
25-03-2018T01:31:20,Bgrmystr2,"I'd like to say I fall in my sincere friend category, but"
25-03-2018T01:31:37,TorqueEmUp,anyone can say anything about themselves
25-03-2018T01:31:39,Bgrmystr2,"I'm also the asshole friend category, cuz I don't mince words"
25-03-2018T01:31:46,Bgrmystr2,I don't play nice :u
25-03-2018T01:31:59,Bgrmystr2,"I tell people what they need to hear, even if they don't like it"
25-03-2018T01:32:05,Bgrmystr2,and prefer they do the same to me
25-03-2018T01:32:15,Bgrmystr2,"some ppl don't like it, and I totally respect that"
25-03-2018T01:32:22,Bgrmystr2,I just let them go and find other people
25-03-2018T01:32:27,Bgrmystr2,don't get in their hair.
25-03-2018T01:32:57,Bgrmystr2,"I ain't worried about it, I don't lose any sleep over it"
25-03-2018T01:33:04,Vatruvius,The latest group of friends I left could not respect my wishes. I just did not want them to a certain thing to me the rest of them were enjoying with each other and they did it anyway. I called them out on it and they were all assholes so I left.
25-03-2018T01:33:14,Vatruvius,"Not worth my time, energy, or emotions."
25-03-2018T01:33:20,TorqueEmUp,Also what allows you to dictate what people need to hear? That's just looking down on everyone and saying you are better than them regardless if you are right or wrong.
25-03-2018T01:33:45,Bgrmystr2,"That's not really how it works, torque."
25-03-2018T01:34:30,Vatruvius,"So you give the the raw truth, blunt and to the point. No sugar coating it?"
25-03-2018T01:34:42,Bgrmystr2,exactly vatru. I tell them how I see it.
25-03-2018T01:34:46,Bgrmystr2,I'm not always right
25-03-2018T01:34:49,Bgrmystr2,and I'll fully admit it
25-03-2018T01:34:57,Bgrmystr2,I ain't perfect
25-03-2018T01:35:29,Bgrmystr2,but some ppl need a 3rd party to tell them what happened
25-03-2018T01:35:31,Vatruvius,That makes sense...it is better to have a friend that tells you that you look like shit before going out in public instead of saying the opposite to save pain.
25-03-2018T01:35:36,TorqueEmUp,"Then technically you are not really telling them what they ""need"" to hear, you are telling them what you want them to hear. :P"
25-03-2018T01:36:07,TorqueEmUp,You are just telling them straight up how you feel about it.
25-03-2018T01:36:08,Bgrmystr2,"Also not true, torque, because it's entirely based on actions, not emotions"
25-03-2018T01:36:20,Vatruvius,I want to know if I look like shit damn it...it will be way wish if I found out later out in the world!
25-03-2018T01:36:35,Vatruvius,worse* not wish
25-03-2018T01:38:44,Vatruvius,I always prefer honest people...you can really judge who they are and know they are okay with you being honest as well because they see it the same way.
25-03-2018T01:39:06,Bgrmystr2,"Knowing someone who was taking advantage of someone else, having them buy all this stuff,  thousands of dollars worth, having them visit, and then a month later when he finds out she's like 1400 miles away and pregnant.."
25-03-2018T01:39:13,Bgrmystr2,then tells her he doesn't want to be a father and cuts all ties
25-03-2018T01:39:23,Bgrmystr2,you tell me you don't think that guy's an assface?
25-03-2018T01:39:34,Vatruvius,Plus...being honest people means that even if there are differences it will not matter because you were honest about it.
25-03-2018T01:39:54,Bgrmystr2,And that's just one example
25-03-2018T01:40:04,TorqueEmUp,Honestly the world would collapse if everyone was honest with eachother. :P
25-03-2018T01:40:18,TorqueEmUp,100% of the time
25-03-2018T01:40:27,Bgrmystr2,"yeah because people can't handle it. Given time, people would be able to"
25-03-2018T01:40:33,Bgrmystr2,and it'd grow back stronger
25-03-2018T01:40:38,Bgrmystr2,faster
25-03-2018T01:40:41,Bgrmystr2,more intelligent
25-03-2018T01:40:44,Vatruvius,Yes and no...you have to know when to be honest and when not to be. There is certainly some things you should be honest about up front.
25-03-2018T01:41:18,Bgrmystr2,I don't see any reason to not be honest about something
25-03-2018T01:41:20,TorqueEmUp,Nobody is completely honest
25-03-2018T01:41:32,TorqueEmUp,everyone hide something
25-03-2018T01:41:36,Vatruvius,Jesus is the only one 100% honest.
25-03-2018T01:41:38,TorqueEmUp,hides*
25-03-2018T01:41:54,Vatruvius,According to the bible.
25-03-2018T01:41:56,Bgrmystr2,hiding something is not the same as not being honest.
25-03-2018T01:42:52,TorqueEmUp,Not being honest though means you are hiding your emotions
25-03-2018T01:42:52,Bgrmystr2,"Everyone has secrets. That's understandable. But as soon as one lies about it, that's where the dishonesty starts"
25-03-2018T01:43:16,Bgrmystr2,that's not the same honesty I was talkin about xD
25-03-2018T01:44:12,Bgrmystr2,ITT talkin about two different things which are described with the same word
25-03-2018T01:44:27,Bgrmystr2,English language y u so.. &gt;:C
25-03-2018T01:44:58,Vatruvius,A good example to what Bgr means...I would like to know if someone I was beginning to really like hanging out with and become close friends was gay. If they lied and they were...that would make me feel partially sad and upset.
25-03-2018T01:45:43,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Goodnight.
25-03-2018T01:45:52,Vatruvius,Goodnight Darth!
25-03-2018T01:46:00,Bgrmystr2,"well, people tell lies sometimes, gotta forgive some of em. Some ppl have their reasons. Not always good reasons, but understandable reasons nonetheless"
25-03-2018T01:46:02,Bgrmystr2,gnight Rex
25-03-2018T01:46:36,Bgrmystr2,"Basically Vatru, I would say.. if they SAID they were not, and they are, then I would see that as lie."
25-03-2018T01:46:37,Bgrmystr2,but
25-03-2018T01:46:55,Bgrmystr2,"if they did not say they were, like not directly"
25-03-2018T01:47:35,Bgrmystr2,"then it's not really a lie, it's just improper implications I guess would be the best way to say it"
25-03-2018T01:47:44,Vatruvius,"If they told me honestly that they were afraid I would not be their friend if I knew then that is fine, but if they had ""plans"" for me...then no."
25-03-2018T01:48:00,Bgrmystr2,totally understand vatru ;u
25-03-2018T01:48:17,Bgrmystr2,would agree w/ that
25-03-2018T01:49:25,Vatruvius,"Finding this community has been great...not just because it is awesome...but since my keyboard is broken preventing my from playing the majority of my games, I would have nothing else to do."
25-03-2018T01:49:37,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-03-2018T01:49:53,Bgrmystr2,I've found some pretty good people in this community. Some not so good
25-03-2018T01:49:59,Bgrmystr2,some questionable
25-03-2018T01:50:23,Bgrmystr2,"but for the most part, just ordinary people who like a certain type of art"
25-03-2018T01:50:36,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
25-03-2018T01:50:41,Bgrmystr2,"iunno, seems kinda normal to me"
25-03-2018T01:50:44,Bgrmystr2,for the most part
25-03-2018T01:51:32,DarthRexKing,"Lies and weak willed people infest this world. That is my opinion about it. It will become worse if we do not have more honest and strong willed people, like Bgr."
25-03-2018T01:51:47,DarthRexKing,That is just my opinion on this though. This topic is interesting.
25-03-2018T01:52:14,Vatruvius,So far...everyone has been pretty cool. But...without a question...the stream trolls are awful. Luckily they do not become a part of this community. Just brief nuisances.
25-03-2018T01:52:57,DarthRexKing,"Some people need their lives extinguished so the rest of humanity can prosper, just as these lowly trolls."
25-03-2018T01:53:26,Vatruvius,I have to say...this has been one of the best communities I have found. Maybe because the comic really attracts good people.
25-03-2018T01:53:31,DarthRexKing,"To be honest myself, some need to be destroyed."
25-03-2018T01:53:41,Vatruvius,Like Hitler!
25-03-2018T01:53:44,DarthRexKing,"and yes, I like the people here too."
25-03-2018T01:53:53,DarthRexKing,He is already gone.
25-03-2018T01:54:11,Vatruvius,Who knows...is there another one on his/her way?
25-03-2018T01:54:52,Vatruvius,Would have save a lot of people if he was taken care of earlier.
25-03-2018T01:55:04,DarthRexKing,"I do not know. Anyway, I am going to become a psychologist. the better we further our understanding of the human mind, we will be able to better manage our actions, thoughts, intelligence, and will."
25-03-2018T01:55:32,Vatruvius,"There will always be bad people, we just have to hope there are enough good people out there to balance them out and keep them from gaining positions of power."
25-03-2018T01:55:36,DarthRexKing,Then maybe humanity as a whole can get its act together and not ruin itself over petty things and actually learn from past mistakes.
25-03-2018T01:55:45,DarthRexKing,"There is Vatru, other wise we would not be here."
25-03-2018T01:56:19,DarthRexKing,"As long as there are bad people, we will either reform or terminate them."
25-03-2018T01:56:31,Vatruvius,I am an advocate for world peace and cooperation...I would like to see that happen in my life time.
25-03-2018T01:56:56,DarthRexKing,"If not, we will lay the foundation for future generations to do so. We must seize power in order to do so."
25-03-2018T01:58:05,Vatruvius,I have to say...sometimes I feel that people are so stupid or corrupt that I should just force myself to be king and ensure good things happen. Of course...it is just a momentary thought that makes me feel better about a bad situation.
25-03-2018T01:58:49,Vatruvius,"I would never want to actually force rule over people or be king, even though it seems so simple and would solve so many problems."
25-03-2018T01:59:42,Bgrmystr2,just FYI the trolls are likely a select few people or the same one person
25-03-2018T01:59:54,Bgrmystr2,because they all do basically the same thing
25-03-2018T01:59:57,Bgrmystr2,and they do it for attention
25-03-2018T01:59:58,DarthRexKing,"Yes, I do believe force is needed, but knowing how to solve the problem and why and how it was caused, and there are a lot of them, is also important. Knowledge is power."
25-03-2018T02:00:07,Bgrmystr2,"and have done it for years, longer than picarto has existed"
25-03-2018T02:00:15,DarthRexKing,We know that.
25-03-2018T02:00:20,Bgrmystr2,"for a very long time, all the way back to 4ch days"
25-03-2018T02:00:20,Vatruvius,I have Tom's old streams playing in the background on youtube and just alt+tabbed to find Tom sketching the Natani and Keith Play Twister sketch.
25-03-2018T02:00:23,Bgrmystr2,so they won't be going anywhere
25-03-2018T02:00:37,Bgrmystr2,"best to ignore, ban, and not talk about em"
25-03-2018T02:00:42,Bgrmystr2,"but basically, that's them"
25-03-2018T02:00:52,DarthRexKing,We know that.
25-03-2018T02:01:10,DarthRexKing,But I wonder if there is a way to track trolls and give them a computer virus. Wishful thinking. XD
25-03-2018T02:01:23,Vatruvius,I mean...look at Tom. He is an old Troll of us lowly chatters.
25-03-2018T02:01:35,Bgrmystr2,"it was mostly for Vatru, Rex"
25-03-2018T02:01:42,Bgrmystr2,also weren't you supposed to be going to bed?
25-03-2018T02:01:42,DarthRexKing,Ah.
25-03-2018T02:01:48,Bgrmystr2,or something
25-03-2018T02:01:52,Vatruvius,There is...if you are good enough with computers and code. I however would not use my skills for that if I had those skills.
25-03-2018T02:01:57,DarthRexKing,"This conversation grabbed my interest, but I will soon."
25-03-2018T02:02:07,DarthRexKing,Tom is far from a troll.
25-03-2018T02:02:07,Vatruvius,lol
25-03-2018T02:02:19,Bgrmystr2,"tom does troll, but he's not malicious"
25-03-2018T02:02:22,Vatruvius,I am teasing him...but he does troll us from time to time.
25-03-2018T02:02:26,Bgrmystr2,he just enjoys messing with the community
25-03-2018T02:02:36,Bgrmystr2,whom are at large sometimes gullible
25-03-2018T02:02:44,Bgrmystr2,and overreact
25-03-2018T02:02:49,Vatruvius,As does anyone...messing with people to a certain degree is all in good fun.
25-03-2018T02:02:54,Bgrmystr2,either on purpose or by accident
25-03-2018T02:02:56,DarthRexKing,"If tom were a troll, he would be malicious. Trolls are malicious and he is far from that."
25-03-2018T02:03:00,Bgrmystr2,it's like a game
25-03-2018T02:03:11,Bgrmystr2,"some ppl like it, some ppl hate it"
25-03-2018T02:03:13,Bgrmystr2,but everyone plays
25-03-2018T02:03:20,DarthRexKing,Though I understand if he pranks others if they are gullible. That is their fault.
25-03-2018T02:04:05,DarthRexKing,The weak and the gullible will always be taken advantage of by the strong and quick witted.
25-03-2018T02:04:05,Vatruvius,Like this guy...he is a troll! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTSA_sWGM44
25-03-2018T02:04:25,Bgrmystr2,"no, he's a singer"
25-03-2018T02:04:28,Vatruvius,:ptv-dealwithit:
25-03-2018T02:04:47,Bgrmystr2,not a bad voice either
25-03-2018T02:05:31,DarthRexKing,"He is not actually saying troll, it just sounds like it."
25-03-2018T02:06:05,Vatruvius,"He has to be dead though...right? It looks like the video is very old. If he is alive...I feel sorry for what he must think of his performance and what is caused on the internet. But he did get popular though, that one song anyway."
25-03-2018T02:06:14,DarthRexKing,"I used to not like pranksters. Always thought they were overgrown children who screwed around too much. I still believe that, but now I realize that if people are gullible, it is their fault for being pranked in the first place."
25-03-2018T02:06:36,DarthRexKing,"He was alive some time ago, but died. I forgot what year but it was not too long aog."
25-03-2018T02:06:38,DarthRexKing,ago
25-03-2018T02:07:14,Vatruvius,"I hate pranksters who think it is cool to take someones close, put shaving cream in their car, or otherwise actually destroy property or seriously hurt someone. Those are not pranks."
25-03-2018T02:07:14,Bgrmystr2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Khil
25-03-2018T02:07:18,Bgrmystr2,died in 2012
25-03-2018T02:07:33,Vatruvius,cloths*
25-03-2018T02:07:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"When pulling pranks, confuse - don’t abuse"
25-03-2018T02:08:35,Bgrmystr2,"I would disagree with that, Rex. People that are gullible do not know any better. They need to be taught stuff. Not everyone knows everything, and it is by NO means anyone's fault for not knowing something"
25-03-2018T02:08:52,DarthRexKing,That is human nature Vat. Someone else's pain is someone else's pleasure. Some people call it mean and others call them pansies. Some say it is funny and others call them mean. I just laugh at both sides and watch the fireworks and butt hurt.
25-03-2018T02:09:12,DarthRexKing,"Interesting take on that, Bgr."
25-03-2018T02:09:27,Bgrmystr2,it's unfair to blame someone's lack of knowledge as their own fault if they hadn't any idea they didn't know it in the first place.
25-03-2018T02:09:46,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, children don't know fire hurts, do they? It's just red and orange and pretty"
25-03-2018T02:09:48,Bgrmystr2,and they wanna touch it
25-03-2018T02:09:54,SpazztasticKiwi,How acceptable is the “asking you out as a prank” jokes?
25-03-2018T02:09:55,Bgrmystr2,burns like a right bastard
25-03-2018T02:09:56,Vatruvius,All fun and games until it is your car or you that is being vandalized. Witty pranks are good though and they usually involve a group of close friends.
25-03-2018T02:10:39,DarthRexKing,"That is where the phrase *It is only funny if it is someone else.* comes in, Vat. Every person for themselves."
25-03-2018T02:10:46,DarthRexKing,"And I see your point, Bgr."
25-03-2018T02:10:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Because that’s a common one used in bullying
25-03-2018T02:10:58,Vatruvius,"Great if it is just stupid, but if you actually made a person's day and it was a prank. You actually traumatized that person."
25-03-2018T02:11:16,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, a lot of ""pranks"" are used to bully people, and a lot of those out there get kicks out of that"
25-03-2018T02:11:29,Bgrmystr2,so it's not all great :u
25-03-2018T02:11:44,DarthRexKing,These conversations prove one thing. Humanity is a complicated and messed up species. XD
25-03-2018T02:11:54,Bgrmystr2,"true, Rex"
25-03-2018T02:12:09,Vatruvius,Bullying is at an all time high now with the internet and stuff...something that is really going to have to be addressed and changed in the years to come.
25-03-2018T02:12:12,Bgrmystr2,but we haven't devolved into stabbing each other yet ! :knife:
25-03-2018T02:12:12,SpazztasticKiwi,That one happened to me a bit in high school. One reason why I’m suspicious of a compliment
25-03-2018T02:12:39,Vatruvius,I think you are a great person Kiwi...no strings attached...I promise! :D
25-03-2018T02:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"And often question thoroughly someone’s attitude towards me “ is he interested, being nice, or messing with me?”"
25-03-2018T02:13:20,DarthRexKing,"That is why I envision one day, we stand together and truly reshape humanity. Realize that our history is not so much black and white. There is a lot of grey."
25-03-2018T02:13:23,Vatruvius,Shit...that sentence is literally a string bytes creating the letters in the sentence! Agh...I am so sorry! :P
25-03-2018T02:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"And :ptv-snicker: stop it, you"
25-03-2018T02:13:39,DarthRexKing,string bytes?
25-03-2018T02:13:42,DarthRexKing,sorry about what?
25-03-2018T02:14:09,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: Damnit Vatru
25-03-2018T02:14:12,Bgrmystr2,hahah
25-03-2018T02:14:23,Vatruvius,"It is a nerd pun...this sentence literally forms what is called a ""string"" of bytes in binary."
25-03-2018T02:14:35,Bgrmystr2,Fuckin.. take my +1 and getouttahere x'D
25-03-2018T02:14:41,Bgrmystr2,don't actually leave tho
25-03-2018T02:15:05,Vatruvius,:ptv-hearts:
25-03-2018T02:15:07,DarthRexKing,"So in other words, computer data forming into the words we are typing?"
25-03-2018T02:15:12,Bgrmystr2,yeh Rex
25-03-2018T02:15:15,Vatruvius,Yes.
25-03-2018T02:15:22,Bgrmystr2,"See Vatru, it's a good thing I'm here"
25-03-2018T02:15:28,Bgrmystr2,cuz noone else would have got your pun :v
25-03-2018T02:15:31,DarthRexKing,"Okay, that is nothing new. Is spazz just now figuring that out?"
25-03-2018T02:15:35,DarthRexKing,Also sorry for what?
25-03-2018T02:15:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew a guy that didn’t tolerate bullying around him. Probably because he knew what it could be like
25-03-2018T02:15:48,Bgrmystr2,that was part of the joke Rex lol
25-03-2018T02:16:00,DarthRexKing,What joke?
25-03-2018T02:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Figuring out what
25-03-2018T02:16:18,Bgrmystr2,Oh no Vatru he's one of those
25-03-2018T02:16:21,Bgrmystr2,aaaaaaa
25-03-2018T02:16:31,Vatruvius,*sigh*...not a nerd. I feel for you Darth...I real do.
25-03-2018T02:16:34,DarthRexKing,You just now figured out that computer data is forming the words we type. I was also asking what you were saying sorry for.
25-03-2018T02:16:59,DarthRexKing,"What is wrong with being a nerd, Vat? Nerds are smarter in certain subjects than others. XD"
25-03-2018T02:17:12,DarthRexKing,Power to the nerd.
25-03-2018T02:17:30,DarthRexKing,Also you feel what for me?
25-03-2018T02:17:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Aren’t we all technically nerds here
25-03-2018T02:17:48,DarthRexKing,Yep.
25-03-2018T02:17:58,Vatruvius,"I told Kiwi that there was no strings attached to my compliment but I then apologized because that sentence was a string of data which meant I lied. A good nerd joke. And nothing is wrong with nerds, I identify as one."
25-03-2018T02:18:01,Bgrmystr2,"lol Rex, Vatru said ""sorry"" because the statement was ""No strings attached"" when the statement is a literal string of binary code sent over the internet"
25-03-2018T02:18:11,Bgrmystr2,so it would be a lie :u
25-03-2018T02:18:14,Bgrmystr2,hence the joke
25-03-2018T02:18:21,DarthRexKing,Okay?
25-03-2018T02:18:30,Bgrmystr2,"there, I've explained the joke"
25-03-2018T02:18:32,Bgrmystr2,I've ruined it
25-03-2018T02:18:45,Vatruvius,No problem...I got my life. :D
25-03-2018T02:18:50,DarthRexKing,How is it ruined if you explained it so it can be understood?
25-03-2018T02:18:51,Vatruvius,laugh*
25-03-2018T02:19:00,Bgrmystr2,because then the joke isn't funny anymore
25-03-2018T02:19:11,DarthRexKing,How?
25-03-2018T02:19:21,Bgrmystr2,cuz it becomes all awkward and stuff :U
25-03-2018T02:19:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Too early for strange jokes
25-03-2018T02:19:29,Vatruvius,It is typical that if you have to explain a joke it takes the fun out of it.
25-03-2018T02:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Needs too much brain power
25-03-2018T02:19:39,Bgrmystr2,what vatru said
25-03-2018T02:19:58,DarthRexKing,I do not understand why a joke is not funny if explained.
25-03-2018T02:20:13,Vatruvius,"Nothing wrong if you do not understand it, jokes are created for certain types of people to get."
25-03-2018T02:20:24,DarthRexKing,In jokes.
25-03-2018T02:20:33,Bgrmystr2,"you know what, Rex reminds me of that guy from Guardians of the Galaxy"
25-03-2018T02:20:44,Bgrmystr2,don't recall his name though
25-03-2018T02:20:47,DarthRexKing,"Thrax, right?"
25-03-2018T02:20:50,Bgrmystr2,the super serious one
25-03-2018T02:20:53,Vatruvius,Yes!
25-03-2018T02:20:54,DarthRexKing,I am terrible at remembering names.
25-03-2018T02:21:01,Vatruvius,He took everything seriously.
25-03-2018T02:21:02,DarthRexKing,Ah. I was right.
25-03-2018T02:21:33,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, and they were like, the joke flew over his head.. and he replied with somethin to the sort of ""My reflexes are too fast, I would catch it"""
25-03-2018T02:21:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s “Drax”
25-03-2018T02:21:43,DarthRexKing,That is why I like Thrax. The serious ones always get things done. He was sort of a simpleton though.
25-03-2018T02:21:45,Vatruvius,"It is Drax actually, but yeah."
25-03-2018T02:21:48,Bgrmystr2,"which, not only did he not get the joke, but he made one without knowing"
25-03-2018T02:21:53,DarthRexKing,Ah Drax.
25-03-2018T02:22:03,Bgrmystr2,DarthDraxKing
25-03-2018T02:22:12,DarthRexKing,Darth Rex King. XD
25-03-2018T02:22:13,Bgrmystr2,we have identified you.
25-03-2018T02:22:22,DarthRexKing,"It's rex, not Drax."
25-03-2018T02:22:26,Bgrmystr2,Too late
25-03-2018T02:22:26,DarthRexKing,Typo there.
25-03-2018T02:22:32,DarthRexKing,too late for what?
25-03-2018T02:22:32,Bgrmystr2,"not a typo, you are now Drax"
25-03-2018T02:22:42,DarthRexKing,"No, it's rex. Look at my name."
25-03-2018T02:22:46,Vatruvius,Drax will be your nickname.
25-03-2018T02:22:52,Bgrmystr2,"Aaand woosh, over his head"
25-03-2018T02:22:54,DarthRexKing,Why?
25-03-2018T02:23:00,Bgrmystr2,just like drax xD
25-03-2018T02:23:05,Vatruvius,When you join the chat...we will welcome Drax.
25-03-2018T02:23:15,Bgrmystr2,I have witnesses!
25-03-2018T02:23:19,DarthRexKing,Why? I already chose my picarto name.
25-03-2018T02:23:45,Vatruvius,Because it is amusing and will forever remind us of this moment.
25-03-2018T02:23:55,DarthRexKing,I am already lost.
25-03-2018T02:24:09,Vatruvius,Don't worry Drax...just be you.
25-03-2018T02:24:14,Vatruvius,:D
25-03-2018T02:24:51,Bgrmystr2,"I'mma let you guys handle this, I gotta get somethin to eat xD"
25-03-2018T02:25:04,DarthRexKing,"I am not an oblivious blue man. I like t-rex, and I like the Sith because they are violent psychopaths and sociopaths who kill people out of spite."
25-03-2018T02:25:08,Vatruvius,Sgr...here is another one. 10+01=3
25-03-2018T02:25:28,DarthRexKing,10 + 1 equals 11
25-03-2018T02:25:33,Vatruvius,"Drax, I mean you, are not blue. :D"
25-03-2018T02:25:35,DarthRexKing,What are you on about?
25-03-2018T02:26:00,DarthRexKing,I feel like I am missing something.
25-03-2018T02:26:01,Vatruvius,"No, 10+01=3"
25-03-2018T02:26:32,Vatruvius,"This is really not that good of one, but you do not get it so...yes!"
25-03-2018T02:26:33,DarthRexKing,Is this some math code riddle or you speaking nonsense?
25-03-2018T02:26:38,DarthRexKing,Okay.
25-03-2018T02:26:58,Vatruvius,Let's see if I can think of another one...
25-03-2018T02:28:00,DarthRexKing,Another what?
25-03-2018T02:28:48,Vatruvius,101+011=8
25-03-2018T02:29:20,Vatruvius,It would be more proper if it were like this: 0101+0011=8
25-03-2018T02:29:53,DarthRexKing,I am going to guess it is binary code.
25-03-2018T02:30:42,DarthRexKing,I may not going into computer sciences but the subject still fascinates me.
25-03-2018T02:31:29,Vatruvius,Yeah...simple binary code. Learned in 2 hours at class the beginning of the semester.
25-03-2018T02:32:07,Vatruvius,For instance: 1111 1101 = -3
25-03-2018T02:33:48,DarthRexKing,"Would it be nice if every single person knew how to code. Think of all the potential computer whizzes we could have. All the potential troll hackers, stalker hackers, people hacking just to screw around and then getting arrested for hacking something they"
25-03-2018T02:33:52,DarthRexKing,should not have.
25-03-2018T02:34:05,Vatruvius,Which is also equal to fd
25-03-2018T02:34:20,DarthRexKing,fd as in fucked? XD
25-03-2018T02:34:39,Vatruvius,"It would be nice, it would mean my pay check would be significantly less."
25-03-2018T02:34:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom go to bed or is he still creepin
25-03-2018T02:35:00,Vatruvius,"fd as in -3, that was the hexadecimal form of -3"
25-03-2018T02:35:18,Vatruvius,"Yo Tom, did you get my string joke earlier?"
25-03-2018T02:35:21,DarthRexKing,"Okay. I figured it was going to be that, but I was hoping for fucked. XD"
25-03-2018T02:36:04,DarthRexKing,"Tell me vat, you always tell people ignorant of binary code binary jokes just to make them look stupid? If so, good on you. XD"
25-03-2018T02:37:03,Vatruvius,"No, I don't. I once was the ignorant one in high school and did not understand the binary joke on someones T-shirt...I get it now of course but I am not like that."
25-03-2018T02:37:27,Vatruvius,It was just very fitting in this case since we were on the subject.
25-03-2018T02:37:43,DarthRexKing,Ah. Nothing wrong with a little bit of cruelty now and then. Keeps people on their toes. XD
25-03-2018T02:38:17,Vatruvius,That is why we call you Drax...I kinda like it actually.
25-03-2018T02:38:53,DarthRexKing,Because Drax liked being cruel to people to keep them aware? I do not recall that.
25-03-2018T02:39:55,Bgrmystr2,"I would consider everything cruelty like that a bad thing, Rex"
25-03-2018T02:40:17,Vatruvius,Because jokes went over his head...and that one joke went over yours so it just feels right. All in good fun. Don't worry though...if people ask why we call you Drax I will no humiliate you/not tell. That would kill the reason why anyway.
25-03-2018T02:40:39,Bgrmystr2,but that's boring :u
25-03-2018T02:40:42,Vatruvius,Bgr...you should look at my other nerd joke up above.
25-03-2018T02:40:56,Bgrmystr2,the one with the binary
25-03-2018T02:41:01,Vatruvius,Yeah
25-03-2018T02:41:05,Bgrmystr2,"I don't actually know binary, so you're talking to a rock here"
25-03-2018T02:41:09,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-03-2018T02:41:12,Vatruvius,Darn!
25-03-2018T02:41:16,Bgrmystr2,apologies lol
25-03-2018T02:41:27,Bgrmystr2,"come at me with that computer hardware jokes, tho"
25-03-2018T02:41:29,Bgrmystr2,and you'll have me
25-03-2018T02:41:33,Bgrmystr2,or stuff like that
25-03-2018T02:41:41,Bgrmystr2,I'm not super big on the coding side
25-03-2018T02:41:49,Bgrmystr2,more on hardware and stuff :u
25-03-2018T02:42:03,Bgrmystr2,sec brb again
25-03-2018T02:42:25,DarthRexKing,Those who humiliate me have to die! XD
25-03-2018T02:42:52,Bgrmystr2,back
25-03-2018T02:42:56,DarthRexKing,Ello.
25-03-2018T02:43:24,Vatruvius,I am not someone who has jokes in a bag and can just pull from them whenever. I am more of a in the moment type of jokester. Like that string joke. I wrote that comment with no strings attached and then it hit me right after I posted it.
25-03-2018T02:44:05,DarthRexKing,Though my humor is not too bad. I got some good ones. Where can you commonly find ground beef other than a super market?
25-03-2018T02:44:27,Vatruvius,Hmm...
25-03-2018T02:44:42,Vatruvius,At a farm?
25-03-2018T02:44:47,DarthRexKing,At a car accident. XD
25-03-2018T02:45:35,Vatruvius,That seems dark...that or now I am the one who does not get it. I was think of ground beef as in cows on the ground so at a farm.
25-03-2018T02:45:59,DarthRexKing,I like dark humor.
25-03-2018T02:46:01,DarthRexKing,Xd
25-03-2018T02:46:03,DarthRexKing,X3
25-03-2018T02:46:39,DarthRexKing,"Some accidents are so bad well, let's just say the ground gets painted red."
25-03-2018T02:47:13,Vatruvius,Yup...definitely dark. I liked my connection a farm better. I like witty jokes.
25-03-2018T02:47:37,Vatruvius,Do you get what I meant when I said a farm?
25-03-2018T02:48:11,DarthRexKing,"Yeah, because you were trying to figure out my ground beef joke. I got another. Zombies do exist in real life, but not the way you think. How?"
25-03-2018T02:48:35,DarthRexKing,Go find a lobotomized person. XD
25-03-2018T02:49:39,Vatruvius,Okay okay okay...enough of that.
25-03-2018T02:49:50,DarthRexKing,Also puns. I like puns. If you saw my puns made off of some of the streamers names here. I make puns.
25-03-2018T02:49:53,DarthRexKing,Enough of what?
25-03-2018T02:50:43,Vatruvius,Enough of the dark jokes.
25-03-2018T02:51:38,DarthRexKing,"Okay? Anyway, I really must go. I have college at 11 in the morning. I want to be at my best, since fools in my class are either failing or not showing up. More education for me."
25-03-2018T02:51:39,Vatruvius,I like puns too...that is my specialty. But again...they are in the moment and limited to what I know.
25-03-2018T02:51:49,DarthRexKing,Of course.
25-03-2018T02:52:00,Vatruvius,Goodnight Drax!
25-03-2018T02:52:03,Vatruvius,:D
25-03-2018T02:52:20,DarthRexKing,Have a good night Vatruvius. May the nightmares haunt your dreams tonight!
25-03-2018T02:52:32,Vatruvius,Noooooo!
25-03-2018T02:52:38,Vatruvius,:P
25-03-2018T02:52:44,DarthRexKing,"Seriously, I hope they do. XD Also I it is Rex, not Drax."
25-03-2018T02:52:50,DarthRexKing,Later!
25-03-2018T02:52:59,Vatruvius,May the bedbugs feast on your flesh tonight.
25-03-2018T02:53:22,DarthRexKing,That will happen when we die and become corpses.
25-03-2018T02:53:42,Vatruvius,"No, bedbugs like their victims alive."
25-03-2018T02:54:05,Bgrmystr2,gnight Drax :v
25-03-2018T02:54:09,Vatruvius,The suck your blood then hide in your mattress during the day.
25-03-2018T02:54:15,Vatruvius,"Yes, Bgr gets it!"
25-03-2018T02:54:35,DarthRexKing,"I was making a comparison to when people are buried in a coffin, the bugs feast on your rotting flesh until you are bone."
25-03-2018T02:54:37,Bgrmystr2,well of course I do. I'm the one that brought it up lol
25-03-2018T02:54:51,DarthRexKing,Brought what up?
25-03-2018T02:55:01,Bgrmystr2,you being like Drax
25-03-2018T02:55:06,Vatruvius,"Besides, we really are just rearranging the letters in your name to something simpler like Drax...but only Drax."
25-03-2018T02:55:06,DarthRexKing,How?
25-03-2018T02:55:28,Bgrmystr2,"because you don't always get jokes and puns, and they fly over your head"
25-03-2018T02:55:36,Vatruvius,There is a D an A an R and an x in your name.
25-03-2018T02:55:38,Bgrmystr2,"or they would, if your reflexes weren't fast enough to catch them :v"
25-03-2018T02:55:39,DarthRexKing,"That is not rearranging, you took out some letters to shorten it to Drax."
25-03-2018T02:55:54,DarthRexKing,"That is a common trait in everyone, Bgr."
25-03-2018T02:55:54,Vatruvius,Yup!
25-03-2018T02:56:02,DarthRexKing,Not just me.
25-03-2018T02:56:05,Bgrmystr2,"not SUPER common, though"
25-03-2018T02:56:12,Bgrmystr2,not to that degree lol
25-03-2018T02:56:42,Vatruvius,Alright...alright...we do not mean anything by it Darth...just having fun. But it would really make me happy if you let us call you Drax.
25-03-2018T02:56:45,Bgrmystr2,though not getting jokes and stuff is fairly common by itself yeah
25-03-2018T02:57:02,DarthRexKing,"You people must not get out much. Later. Seriously though, I hope someone gets a nightmare and has a heart attack. That would be so silly, it would be righteous! XD"
25-03-2018T02:57:05,Bgrmystr2,I'll prolly do it tonight then completely forget by tomorrow
25-03-2018T02:57:38,Bgrmystr2,At this point.. maybe  we should just call him Drex? xD
25-03-2018T02:57:48,Bgrmystr2,cuz that was a Draxism if I ever heard one.
25-03-2018T02:57:52,Vatruvius,I have not had a nightmare in a very long time. I guess I have outgrown them.
25-03-2018T02:58:01,DarthRexKing,"Can you explain what your sentence means, Vatruvious?"
25-03-2018T02:58:04,Bgrmystr2,you never outgrow nightmares
25-03-2018T02:58:19,Bgrmystr2,they're likely based on stress
25-03-2018T02:58:21,DarthRexKing,"The one that said not meaning anything by it, and having fun, and being happy about me being called Drax?"
25-03-2018T02:58:23,Bgrmystr2,and things that bother you
25-03-2018T02:59:35,Vatruvius,It just seems like you really do not want us to call you Drax so I will respect that...but we really are just having fun and do not mean to hurt your feelings. It just is fun and will forever remind me of this conversation/jokes that happened today.
25-03-2018T03:00:13,Vatruvius,That is where all nicknames come from...funny events that those involved will only know.
25-03-2018T03:00:13,DarthRexKing,My name is Darth Rex King. I do not know how you are confusing it with Drax. Just read. Simple as that.
25-03-2018T03:00:20,DarthRexKing,Also when did I say my feelings were hurt?
25-03-2018T03:00:29,Vatruvius,Definitely Drax.
25-03-2018T03:00:33,DarthRexKing,You are having fun with what? You are not making sense.
25-03-2018T03:00:37,DarthRexKing,"No, it is rex."
25-03-2018T03:00:38,Bgrmystr2,XD right? Vatru
25-03-2018T03:00:58,Vatruvius,Don't worry...if it is not hurting your feeling do not worry.
25-03-2018T03:01:14,DarthRexKing,I was worried about what?
25-03-2018T03:01:19,DarthRexKing,Now I am lost.
25-03-2018T03:01:25,Bgrmystr2,lost and confused..
25-03-2018T03:01:31,Bgrmystr2,terrible way to live life
25-03-2018T03:01:32,DarthRexKing,"Start from the beginning, what are you talking about?"
25-03-2018T03:01:33,Vatruvius,Shit...that gave me a really good sketch idea.
25-03-2018T03:01:38,Bgrmystr2,nice
25-03-2018T03:01:40,Bgrmystr2,don't tell me
25-03-2018T03:01:42,Bgrmystr2,write it down
25-03-2018T03:01:49,Bgrmystr2,or something
25-03-2018T03:01:54,Vatruvius,"I won't, it will be in the next vote."
25-03-2018T03:01:58,Bgrmystr2,make a note of it and suggest it later
25-03-2018T03:02:05,Bgrmystr2,I hope I know it when I see it
25-03-2018T03:02:10,Bgrmystr2,but I don't wanna be spoiled
25-03-2018T03:02:12,Vatruvius,I just have to think about characters and stuff...but it will be very good.
25-03-2018T03:02:34,Vatruvius,You will know it for sure...no other reason this idea will be suggested when you see it.
25-03-2018T03:02:36,Bgrmystr2,:ok_hand:
25-03-2018T03:03:00,DarthRexKing,"Anyway, I do not believe in worrying or having hurt feelings anymore. Though it is amusing to see other people's feelings hurt now that I realize how trivial it is. XD"
25-03-2018T03:03:41,Bgrmystr2,"pretty sure that makes you a bully, Rex :P"
25-03-2018T03:03:49,DarthRexKing,"And do not bother remembering this chat, vat. There will be so many more, it is simpler to forget them."
25-03-2018T03:03:50,Vatruvius,Yea...I look at my past and just think why. I think innocent people get hurt the most...they grew up the fastest and tend to avoid people at first until the grow older.
25-03-2018T03:04:02,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
25-03-2018T03:04:14,Bgrmystr2,you goin to sleep already tom?
25-03-2018T03:04:17,Vatruvius,Bgr gets what I mean about remembering this specific chat.
25-03-2018T03:04:19,Twokinds,yup
25-03-2018T03:04:24,Bgrmystr2,s'only 4am for you tho
25-03-2018T03:04:24,Twokinds,night
25-03-2018T03:04:27,Vatruvius,Hey Tom...bed warm yet?
25-03-2018T03:04:28,Bgrmystr2,alright
25-03-2018T03:04:34,Bgrmystr2,goodnight then :)
25-03-2018T03:04:36,Vatruvius,lol...only 4am
25-03-2018T03:04:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah only 4
25-03-2018T03:04:42,DarthRexKing,Put a pillow over his mouth and that will stop him from snoring. Also stop him from breathing. XD
25-03-2018T03:04:46,Vatruvius,Yeah...Goodnight Tom!
25-03-2018T03:05:06,Bgrmystr2,"prolly not breathing, Rex"
25-03-2018T03:05:17,Bgrmystr2,unless you've got bad pillows
25-03-2018T03:05:30,DarthRexKing,Why did the boyfriend not respond to his girlfriend after she put a pillow over him to stop from snoring?
25-03-2018T03:05:36,DarthRexKing,Because he was dead! XD
25-03-2018T03:05:48,Vatruvius,Yeah...hahahahaha?!?
25-03-2018T03:06:08,DarthRexKing,"I was looking for a way to make a dead joke......well one can dream, Bgr!"
25-03-2018T03:06:21,DarthRexKing,"Anyway, night!"
25-03-2018T03:07:56,Vatruvius,Go to 1:20 in this video...if you do not laugh...you are heartless. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMI03_veyxw
25-03-2018T03:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder how pale Tom is since he apparently doesn’t go out
25-03-2018T03:16:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably as pale as the rest of us
25-03-2018T03:16:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
25-03-2018T03:17:21,Vatruvius,Goodnight Tom! I though I said that already but apparently not.
25-03-2018T03:18:04,Vatruvius,"I am not that pale, but I do go out. Partially because I have to but also because I could not stay inside forever. Even Tom likes nature so I am sure if he lived in the middle of it he would go out quite a bit."
25-03-2018T03:19:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I think I’m tan. Then I socialize and I’m like “no I’m not”
25-03-2018T03:20:49,Vatruvius,"I get what you mean. I have seen people in Tempe when I use to go to college there that I was like, ""this is embarrassing I am so white."" Then the net day I see someone more pale then I and my mine is blown..."
25-03-2018T03:21:18,Vatruvius,next*
25-03-2018T03:22:38,Vatruvius,I never really thought about it...but Kat is too attractive in some of the colors/pages/sketches. Why Tom...why you do dis? :ptv-uneasy:
25-03-2018T03:24:56,Twokinds,:ptv-snicker:
25-03-2018T03:25:42,Vatruvius,Don't act all innocent...cause you're not Tom!
25-03-2018T03:26:43,Vatruvius,:P
25-03-2018T03:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,You know you’re a fan when you get a crush on a character
25-03-2018T03:36:22,Bgrmystr2,hold the fucking phone
25-03-2018T03:36:22,Vatruvius,"Well...looks like everyone is getting off. Goodnight everyone, I will check back tomor...later today."
25-03-2018T03:36:28,Bgrmystr2,why is tom STILL UP
25-03-2018T03:36:31,Vatruvius,Welp...spoke to soon.
25-03-2018T03:36:37,Bgrmystr2,INSTERT VIBRATING FLORA HERE
25-03-2018T03:36:47,Bgrmystr2,supposed to go to bed xD
25-03-2018T03:37:01,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna be up for another several hours
25-03-2018T03:37:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I have to get up in like four hours
25-03-2018T03:37:10,Vatruvius,I think he is warming his bed still.
25-03-2018T03:37:14,Bgrmystr2,for 20 mins?
25-03-2018T03:37:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m still up
25-03-2018T03:37:48,Vatruvius,I am on spring break so...home made baked goods from breakfast whenever I wake up and no responsibilities for the most part. Yay!
25-03-2018T03:37:56,SpazztasticKiwi,My bed heater’s going too. Main issue is I can’t get comfortable
25-03-2018T03:38:17,Vatruvius,Maybe Tom likes his bed to be really warm?
25-03-2018T03:38:31,Bgrmystr2,maybe
25-03-2018T03:38:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Not warm enough until it’s like being in a toaster
25-03-2018T03:38:53,Bgrmystr2,I don't have normal bedsheets myself
25-03-2018T03:38:59,Bgrmystr2,I have some fuzzy blankets
25-03-2018T03:39:10,Vatruvius,I like toasty beds...they are the best beds. Especially when it is cold in your room.
25-03-2018T03:39:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a rainbow shag comforter
25-03-2018T03:39:39,Bgrmystr2,"when I was younger, my mother gave me a red blanket, not exactly velvet but"
25-03-2018T03:39:43,Vatruvius,I have fleece sheets...winter and all. But during the summer and fall I have to change them out.
25-03-2018T03:39:47,Bgrmystr2,it's the same kinda small furry style
25-03-2018T03:40:14,Bgrmystr2,and several years back she got me a new one cuz the old one was kinda not great anymore
25-03-2018T03:40:22,Bgrmystr2,but what I didn't know is that she got me FOUR of them
25-03-2018T03:40:23,Vatruvius,I assume you are a fan Kiwi...so who is your character crush?
25-03-2018T03:40:32,Bgrmystr2,and stitched them together into one monster blanket
25-03-2018T03:40:45,SpazztasticKiwi,None of them are terribly attractive to me
25-03-2018T03:40:45,Vatruvius,Nice Bgr
25-03-2018T03:40:57,Bgrmystr2,"the thing is so fucking big it can cover a California King bed end to end, floor to floor"
25-03-2018T03:41:07,Bgrmystr2,from the head all the way down to the end
25-03-2018T03:41:08,Bgrmystr2,both sides.
25-03-2018T03:41:13,Bgrmystr2,the blanket is huge
25-03-2018T03:41:14,Vatruvius,Okay...any side characters/sketches/colors that are not in the comic?
25-03-2018T03:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again I haven’t really looked close enough to judge attraction
25-03-2018T03:41:38,Bgrmystr2,"and I sleep with that every night, multi-layer fuzzy"
25-03-2018T03:41:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I like Trace’s attitude and personal
25-03-2018T03:41:40,Vatruvius,Why not?
25-03-2018T03:41:51,SpazztasticKiwi,personality pretty well
25-03-2018T03:41:52,Bgrmystr2,it's the warmest thing ever within like.. 30 seconds
25-03-2018T03:42:03,Bgrmystr2,not even heated
25-03-2018T03:42:11,Bgrmystr2,&lt;3 it so much
25-03-2018T03:42:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"but since he’s considered taken, I’m not terribly interested"
25-03-2018T03:42:21,Vatruvius,I know Bgr's crush.
25-03-2018T03:42:38,Bgrmystr2,do you though?
25-03-2018T03:42:42,Bgrmystr2,do you really?
25-03-2018T03:42:52,Bgrmystr2,Try me then
25-03-2018T03:42:55,Vatruvius,It is your blanket Bgr
25-03-2018T03:43:05,Vatruvius,You just stated it
25-03-2018T03:43:09,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
25-03-2018T03:43:12,Bgrmystr2,oh no
25-03-2018T03:43:14,Bgrmystr2,you got me
25-03-2018T03:43:23,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
25-03-2018T03:43:31,Vatruvius,:heart: and all
25-03-2018T03:43:37,Bgrmystr2,I love lots of things though
25-03-2018T03:43:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Eric’s pretty cool too, but he’d be someone I’d prefer to get to know better before saying I like them"
25-03-2018T03:43:43,Bgrmystr2,I love ppl too
25-03-2018T03:44:52,Vatruvius,I would agree with you there Kiwi...I do like Natani in her own way. But I think I like Kat the most for the fact that she is intelligent/like to read and innocent to a lot.
25-03-2018T03:45:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Now that you’ve really asked, I haven’t paid a lot of attention to characters’ attractiveness, let alone having a crush"
25-03-2018T03:45:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Other people are on my mind
25-03-2018T03:45:41,Vatruvius,I would not say I have a crush per say but I guess you could call it that. I am most attracted to Ket physically and phsychologically.
25-03-2018T03:45:54,Vatruvius,Kat*
25-03-2018T03:46:00,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s definitely a sweetheart
25-03-2018T03:46:08,Bgrmystr2,Honestly..  I dunno who I like the most
25-03-2018T03:46:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Definitely someone I’d get along with
25-03-2018T03:46:27,Vatruvius,And her heart is broken...and I am a sap so that just makes me want to make her feel better.
25-03-2018T03:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again so’s Flora
25-03-2018T03:46:46,Bgrmystr2,"Kat's got a lot of sex appeal, but we don't know a whole lot about her personality, though I do think she's decent at standing up for herself, and that's something I can respect"
25-03-2018T03:46:59,Vatruvius,Flora pounces her way out of anything...which would work on me.
25-03-2018T03:47:02,Bgrmystr2,but I think Flora is really the one I'd hug all day erry day cuz she's just adorable
25-03-2018T03:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a terrible thing when you fall in love but the other person just doesn’t feel it
25-03-2018T03:47:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Bonus points if it’s been a long crush
25-03-2018T03:48:00,Bgrmystr2,"though Nat's awesome, she's tomboyish as hell and for good reason"
25-03-2018T03:48:02,Vatruvius,I know that feeling...it really sucks. Hurts the most when they don't just tell it to you and play hard to get because they do not want to hurt your feelings.
25-03-2018T03:48:14,Bgrmystr2,"though she has a lot of insecurities, also completely understandable"
25-03-2018T03:48:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll fall in love with a smile and a laugh faster than a person’s appearance
25-03-2018T03:48:40,Vatruvius,Someone who is genuine...absolutely.
25-03-2018T03:48:42,Bgrmystr2,"also, Kiwi, I can best you on that terrible thing"
25-03-2018T03:49:11,Bgrmystr2,"not personally, but as a 3rd party and being in the middle of t"
25-03-2018T03:49:12,Bgrmystr2,it*
25-03-2018T03:49:52,Vatruvius,"I would say I am attracted to Natani, Kat, and Flora for all different reasons. But if I took the part that I liked in each and put it in one person I could not do it. They only work on their own."
25-03-2018T03:49:58,Bgrmystr2,"cuz loving someone and them not loving you back, whether or not they tell you, both are bad"
25-03-2018T03:50:33,SpazztasticKiwi,And then there’s the liking someone and them not even knowing you exist...
25-03-2018T03:50:37,Bgrmystr2,"but that's not nearly as bad as having fell in love with someone, then down the years fall OUT of love with them.. and watch the connection between the two slowly and utterly destroyed.."
25-03-2018T03:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Deep
25-03-2018T03:51:07,Bgrmystr2,and the worst place to be in is when they were your parents :ptv-sad:
25-03-2018T03:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully that didn’t sound sarcastic
25-03-2018T03:51:14,Vatruvius,Wow...that was my grandparents. For my mom that was hard. They divorced when she was in her early teens.
25-03-2018T03:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh. My parents were on the way to a divorce before my dad died
25-03-2018T03:51:40,Vatruvius,She had to choose which parent to go with.
25-03-2018T03:51:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel
25-03-2018T03:51:58,Vatruvius,At the time...she had to do it in front of the other parent in court.
25-03-2018T03:52:30,Vatruvius,I can only imagine as a parent how much that would hurt.
25-03-2018T03:52:37,Vatruvius,Not being picked.
25-03-2018T03:53:08,Vatruvius,Basically...choose your partner wisely and don't rush it. It is not fair for the kids.
25-03-2018T03:53:32,Bgrmystr2,I consider your mother lucky
25-03-2018T03:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d hate to fall out of love so much it forces a divorce
25-03-2018T03:53:35,Bgrmystr2,I didn't get to choose
25-03-2018T03:53:59,Vatruvius,Luckily...Kat and I won't have kids so...hooray! :ptv-victory:
25-03-2018T03:54:03,Bgrmystr2,I had to literally walk out of my mother's house
25-03-2018T03:54:19,Vatruvius,Sorry to hear that Bgr...that really sucks.
25-03-2018T03:54:21,Bgrmystr2,in order to finally make them see what they were doin
25-03-2018T03:54:33,Bgrmystr2,they were fighting over me without bothering to see what I wanted
25-03-2018T03:54:44,Bgrmystr2,that was back in.. 03 or or 04..?
25-03-2018T03:54:46,Bgrmystr2,ish
25-03-2018T03:54:48,Bgrmystr2,around there
25-03-2018T03:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"My last bf put up with a lot with me. Cliche as it is, I have mood swings"
25-03-2018T03:55:10,SpazztasticKiwi,He was so patient
25-03-2018T03:55:23,Vatruvius,My uncle is getting divorced...the worst thing is he now ex-wife wants custody of all three kids and is turning the kids against him saying he cheated and bullshit like that. Never involve the kids like that...it is just wrong.
25-03-2018T03:56:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Reason number 104 I’m not dating anyone: few people seem to have the patience for me
25-03-2018T03:57:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to joke that anyone dating me didn’t have to worry about impressing a father
25-03-2018T03:57:28,Vatruvius,Patience is over rated...clearly it is your fault the relationship did not work out Kiwi! :ptv-hearts:
25-03-2018T03:57:43,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: I'm single still after all the shit I saw from my parents, their family, my friends and their relationships.. and the drama that unfolded online that I was witness to"
25-03-2018T03:57:46,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom didn’t like him
25-03-2018T03:57:47,Bgrmystr2,I just..
25-03-2018T03:57:53,Bgrmystr2,ehhhhhh relationships.
25-03-2018T03:58:01,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-uneasy:
25-03-2018T03:58:01,SpazztasticKiwi,And his family was a little overprotective of him
25-03-2018T03:58:06,Vatruvius,Relationships are complicated.
25-03-2018T03:58:23,Bgrmystr2,"I need to find someone that'll accept me for me, faults and all"
25-03-2018T03:58:39,Bgrmystr2,"and I also need to find someone I can accept, faults and all"
25-03-2018T03:58:47,Bgrmystr2,somewhere out there in the sea
25-03-2018T03:58:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a few people ask me why I was with him when I could “get someone better”
25-03-2018T03:59:00,Vatruvius,Ohh well...takes time I think. It is good that he was patient though. I would be patient...because I know she would have to be patient for me on a couple of things as well.
25-03-2018T03:59:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I just...”excuse me?”
25-03-2018T03:59:29,Vatruvius,"Wow...how to be defriended 101, do that"
25-03-2018T04:00:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I might like the personality you shallow prick
25-03-2018T04:00:49,Vatruvius,For second I though you were attacking me and it hurt...
25-03-2018T04:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,No :ptv-wondering:
25-03-2018T04:01:18,Bgrmystr2,"can I poke you and make it feel better, Vatru? :v"
25-03-2018T04:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,People here too precious to be mean
25-03-2018T04:01:32,SpazztasticKiwi,People here friend
25-03-2018T04:01:47,Vatruvius,You can try...no guarantee that you will keep your finger. :P
25-03-2018T04:01:54,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-left: I'm gonna do it anyway. Boop
25-03-2018T04:02:04,Vatruvius,*snap*
25-03-2018T04:02:26,Bgrmystr2,booped you tho
25-03-2018T04:02:28,Bgrmystr2,success.
25-03-2018T04:02:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Trust me, I get mad, you’ll know it. I’m not easily offended or annoyed though"
25-03-2018T04:02:44,Vatruvius,*summon Dr. Strange to revert time and un-break finger.
25-03-2018T04:02:59,Bgrmystr2,"Bah, tis but a scratch!"
25-03-2018T04:03:48,Vatruvius,I know...just for a second though I read that as it being pointed at me and it felt bad because it came out of nowhere and I was being nice and...:ptv-sad::ptv-whiny:...but I figured out it was not at me pretty quickly. I had to reread it though.
25-03-2018T04:04:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew a nice guy in school years ago that’d jump on you if you were mean to someone because of their looks
25-03-2018T04:05:59,Vatruvius,A bit aggressive...though over the years I would definitely stand up for someone if I saw it. At least if I could...
25-03-2018T04:06:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"I never asked for sure, but based on what he looked like, he was half Korean or something similar"
25-03-2018T04:06:56,Vatruvius,"""Eric you piece of shit...Kat loves you...can't you see that you good for nothing pervert!"""
25-03-2018T04:07:10,SpazztasticKiwi,People tried bullying him for it. Didn’t end well for them
25-03-2018T04:07:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I and a few others took a liking to him because he wasn’t afraid to push back on another person’s behalf
25-03-2018T04:08:44,Vatruvius,"Yeah...I am not a violent person so when I was bullied I took it hard. Middle school was hell, none of the teachers would help me, the school admins thought I had ""anger issues"" and it was just bad."
25-03-2018T04:08:57,Vatruvius,It all got better after I left but not before I reached the tipping point.
25-03-2018T04:09:27,Vatruvius,Took a long time for me to get over it...but to this day the defenses I created after all of that are still there.
25-03-2018T04:09:50,Vatruvius,Just a part of my subconscious.
25-03-2018T04:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,He did ask me out at one point. I said no because at the time it seemed just a little too good to be true
25-03-2018T04:10:31,Bgrmystr2,"not an easy thing, unlearning the defenses you created to fight children who were probably just as socially awkward as you were"
25-03-2018T04:10:39,Bgrmystr2,know that shit the hard way personally
25-03-2018T04:10:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t think it was a prank though - more that he could find someone better
25-03-2018T04:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,He later did. And has a daughter now - though I don’t think he’s still with the mother
25-03-2018T04:12:23,Vatruvius,Yeah...I tell ya...getting the guts to ask someone you really have a crush on. Hardest thing to do. If it is fake then no but if there are real feelings it is so hard.
25-03-2018T04:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"People did wonder if I’d said no because he was mixed. If it wasn’t assault, I’d slap a lot more people"
25-03-2018T04:13:24,Vatruvius,Wow...people get too involved with ethnicity/race. I can care less...THEY ARE STILL HUMAN YOU PIECE OF SHIT!
25-03-2018T04:13:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"To be honest, he was really hot"
25-03-2018T04:14:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Hence the “thought he could find someone better”
25-03-2018T04:15:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"We are still friends though. Haven’t seen him in years, but that’s because he moved, so..."
25-03-2018T04:15:15,Vatruvius,I had a crush in middle school while all the bullying was going on...really the only thing that kept me there. I asked her out to play tether-ball and we did...but eventually she was always busy at recess so something happened.
25-03-2018T04:15:54,Vatruvius,Then I came back for a vaccine and she was in line like everyone else...first time she approached me. I moved on by then.
25-03-2018T04:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Had a guy I kind of was interested in at one point
25-03-2018T04:17:34,SpazztasticKiwi,He got kind of flirty...
25-03-2018T04:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And then I found out he was married
25-03-2018T04:18:05,Vatruvius,Wow...
25-03-2018T04:18:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Separated, but not officially divorced"
25-03-2018T04:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I noted out of there quick
25-03-2018T04:18:23,SpazztasticKiwi,*noped
25-03-2018T04:18:38,Vatruvius,Hold up...one sec.
25-03-2018T04:19:15,SpazztasticKiwi,He was a little flirty with my friend too as I was told and had a bit of a temper
25-03-2018T04:19:26,Vatruvius,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc
25-03-2018T04:19:46,Vatruvius,Hence the divorce/break up. Too flirty with others all the time and has a temper.
25-03-2018T04:20:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"He implied that it was because they just grew apart. Now, I’m just like “are you sure about that?”"
25-03-2018T04:20:50,Vatruvius,Yeah...that is just wrong.
25-03-2018T04:21:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, got any horror stories, or you already gone to bed"
25-03-2018T04:22:14,Vatruvius,I really do not care about race/ethnicity or a person's quarks but online is really hard. You get to know people and really become friends with name...but seeing them in person has only ended badly for me. It ruins the relationship what it was.
25-03-2018T04:22:45,Vatruvius,You form this idea of who they or what they look like and I hate that what they look like shatters who I thought they were.
25-03-2018T04:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thing with that guy years ago, I’m not sure about the ethnicity. I never asked cause it seemed rude"
25-03-2018T04:23:04,Vatruvius,I hope he has gone to bed...been a long time now.
25-03-2018T04:24:40,Vatruvius,How about this...because it would certainly ease my conscious if I know...what ethnicity do you identify as?
25-03-2018T04:25:34,Bgrmystr2,you can't.. identify as an ethnicity tho
25-03-2018T04:25:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve been told I’m primarily German, with Native American (Cherokee) close behind and Scottish in last place"
25-03-2018T04:25:39,Bgrmystr2,it's literally based on your body
25-03-2018T04:25:54,Bgrmystr2,"I'm white, I can't say I'm anything other than white"
25-03-2018T04:26:03,Bgrmystr2,it would literally be lying
25-03-2018T04:26:05,Bgrmystr2,:/
25-03-2018T04:26:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"But I don’t see features per say of any of those. Unless I have a DNA test telling me what’s in my blood,"
25-03-2018T04:26:39,Vatruvius,I guess that is what I meant...color of your skin/race. Heritage is something different.
25-03-2018T04:26:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah heratage Idunno
25-03-2018T04:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t feel like saying I’m “this, this, and this” is very accurate"
25-03-2018T04:27:18,Bgrmystr2,"I'm like.. german, canadian french, and a little spanish"
25-03-2018T04:27:26,Bgrmystr2,but I have no idea the percentages
25-03-2018T04:27:29,Bgrmystr2,or whatnot
25-03-2018T04:27:54,Vatruvius,I would say about 35-45% of my heritage comes from axis-power country.
25-03-2018T04:27:56,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I never got super into it"
25-03-2018T04:28:26,Bgrmystr2,I know my dad's family is german
25-03-2018T04:28:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"All I really know is I have what some people say is high cheekbones, and red and black in my hair. There’s even a silver hair now and then"
25-03-2018T04:28:34,Bgrmystr2,I believe
25-03-2018T04:28:37,Bgrmystr2,at least for the most part
25-03-2018T04:28:45,Vatruvius,"I am white though, with french and cech thrown in to those axis countries."
25-03-2018T04:28:45,Bgrmystr2,and my mother's side is definitely canadian french
25-03-2018T04:29:07,Bgrmystr2,but I don't know much beyond that
25-03-2018T04:30:04,Vatruvius,My mom's side of the family is actually royalty in Germany I believe. A few times removed and no longer carrying the name but still there. That is kinda cool.
25-03-2018T04:30:25,Vatruvius,Bow before Duke Vatruvius!
25-03-2018T04:30:33,Vatruvius,That sounds pretty good actually.
25-03-2018T04:30:35,SpazztasticKiwi,My Cherokee heritage is supposed to be from a Cherokee chief
25-03-2018T04:31:03,Vatruvius,"*""Neat"" gif here*"
25-03-2018T04:31:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if I was told right, or if any of it’s true, he married the German part of the heritage"
25-03-2018T04:31:50,Vatruvius,So then what color is your skin? I would assume white at this point but just saying that makes me feel like an ass.
25-03-2018T04:32:00,Vatruvius,Interesting.
25-03-2018T04:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Definitely white
25-03-2018T04:33:36,Bgrmystr2,"If I'm any kind of royalty, I've no idea"
25-03-2018T04:33:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s also been hinted that there’s Chinese in me, but when someone says so, I’m like “where? Look at me - do I look like I have a bit of anything remotely Chinese?”"
25-03-2018T04:33:53,Vatruvius,I think it would be cool to take one of those DNA tests...but what if my German sides shows I am a descendant of one of Hitler's cousins or something. That would make me feel horrible!
25-03-2018T04:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Hitler’s sons agreed to never have children
25-03-2018T04:35:00,Bgrmystr2,"Keep in mind, Vatru, that Hitler, while a tyrant, was still extremely smart"
25-03-2018T04:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"So there’s that possibility down. But if you dig far enough in anyone’s history, you’ll find someone like that in it"
25-03-2018T04:35:13,Vatruvius,He son's lived? I thought they were all killed along with Hitler's suicide as to not allow any capture.
25-03-2018T04:35:14,Bgrmystr2,"genious in mental capacity, even"
25-03-2018T04:35:31,Bgrmystr2,but he was unfortunately not a good person when it came down to it
25-03-2018T04:35:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe he had a daughter too
25-03-2018T04:35:52,Vatruvius,He was an excellent speech giver.
25-03-2018T04:37:00,Vatruvius,Though...having him be some of the first TV broadcasts out to space for aliens to see sets a bad example if they decode the German language at all.
25-03-2018T04:37:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Stupid and crazy never die - they just reform
25-03-2018T04:38:29,Bgrmystr2,"unlikely, Vatru"
25-03-2018T04:38:32,Bgrmystr2,they have no reference point
25-03-2018T04:38:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go on to bed. I have little more than two hours before alarm
25-03-2018T04:39:02,Vatruvius,Maybe...unless they are super advanced and German is a very primitive language that is easy for their technology to decode.
25-03-2018T04:39:04,Bgrmystr2,there'd be so little sent to them that they wouldn't have enough to decipher the language
25-03-2018T04:39:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And then a 9 hour shift
25-03-2018T04:39:29,Vatruvius,Yikes...go to bed! I will not allow to stay up any longer! Goodnight ma'am!
25-03-2018T04:40:05,Bgrmystr2,"I doubt it would decode at all.. it's like trying to read a few bubbles of japanese or russian or something and you have no reference, nothing it points at, no nothing"
25-03-2018T04:40:17,Bgrmystr2,they could literally mean anything.
25-03-2018T04:40:22,Vatruvius,"It would be more proper to say ""goodnight to you ma'am,"" but it is too late. It has been said."
25-03-2018T04:40:31,Bgrmystr2,"also, gnight kiwi"
25-03-2018T04:40:35,Bgrmystr2,late but whatever
25-03-2018T04:41:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Not to mention the quality of those messages that were sent out. They may not be terribly legible
25-03-2018T04:41:14,Vatruvius,Hopefully...because that would be a really bad first impression.
25-03-2018T04:41:18,SpazztasticKiwi,But nity nite 💤
25-03-2018T04:41:26,Vatruvius,Goodnight!
25-03-2018T04:41:27,Bgrmystr2,xD right kiwi
25-03-2018T04:41:28,Bgrmystr2,gnight :v
25-03-2018T04:42:22,Vatruvius,"I am getting really tired to. I am still in my chair so I am going to climb into bed, bring the laptop, fiddle around then pass out. Goodnight Bgr!"
25-03-2018T04:44:00,Bgrmystr2,gnight Vatru
25-03-2018T04:44:15,Bgrmystr2,and with you leaving. I am the sole surviver of the night :ptv-victory:
25-03-2018T04:44:32,Bgrmystr2,anyone else lurking shuttup and let me have this one :(
25-03-2018T04:44:36,Bgrmystr2,I know you're there.
25-03-2018T04:44:46,Bgrmystr2,you can have next time
25-03-2018T04:45:17,Vatruvius,Lol...bye!
25-03-2018T04:45:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
25-03-2018T06:46:18,CheeseRS,Ninja
25-03-2018T06:46:31,CheeseRS,Out
25-03-2018T12:11:07,Vatruvius,Goodmorning everyone! :ptv-greetings: Looks like Cheese got the final say last night Bgr.
25-03-2018T13:48:15,Bigboi182,yo!
25-03-2018T13:48:22,Bigboi182,Anyone here?
25-03-2018T13:48:25,Bigboi182,At all?
25-03-2018T13:48:36,Bigboi182,TOOOM!
25-03-2018T13:50:25,Twokinds,I'm always here.
25-03-2018T13:51:58,Vatruvius,lio
25-03-2018T13:52:20,Vatruvius,lol...seriously phone? Why lio?
25-03-2018T13:54:00,Vatruvius,Anyone get a good breakfast today? I made blueberry scones which were great!
25-03-2018T13:55:40,Bigboi182,"Ok, I honestly didn't expect Tom to say anything."
25-03-2018T13:56:01,Bigboi182,"Seriously, have you become a ninja recently?"
25-03-2018T13:56:17,TheBeckoner,"I just made chicken, eggs and rice with some soy sauce. pretty good."
25-03-2018T13:57:56,Bigboi182,I had oats. Very sugary oats.
25-03-2018T13:58:19,Vatruvius,Of course you did Bigboi
25-03-2018T14:00:33,Bigboi182,What can I say? I'm a sucker for sugar.
25-03-2018T14:00:42,Bigboi182,"What did you have, Tom?"
25-03-2018T14:01:03,Vatruvius,Hmm...do you do anything else but lurk during the day Tom? I mean no offense of course.
25-03-2018T14:01:18,Bigboi182,"Yeah, I'm with Vat on this."
25-03-2018T14:01:38,Vatruvius,2 on 1...you have to answer us now.
25-03-2018T14:01:46,Vatruvius,:ptv-hearts:
25-03-2018T14:04:29,Bigboi182,Agreed. Explain yourself!
25-03-2018T14:05:15,Bigboi182,"Sorry man, the silent treatment isn't working here."
25-03-2018T14:06:49,Vatruvius,I can stay at this for hours Tom...I am on spring break...I will do it!
25-03-2018T14:07:18,Bigboi182,Hang on Vat... I got this.
25-03-2018T14:07:23,Bigboi182,I
25-03-2018T14:07:26,Bigboi182,HATE
25-03-2018T14:07:29,Bigboi182,WHITE
25-03-2018T14:07:31,TheBeckoner,I feel there are much more fulfilling activities then waiting for Tom to say what he had for breakfast lol.
25-03-2018T14:07:32,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
25-03-2018T14:07:35,Bigboi182,CHOCOLATE
25-03-2018T14:08:01,Vatruvius,Nah...I live in this chat. I am with Bgr here...he is just sleeping.
25-03-2018T14:08:16,Bigboi182,Blast! It really is dead.
25-03-2018T14:08:29,Bigboi182,"Vat, give me something to work with."
25-03-2018T14:08:33,Vatruvius,I do not want to wake him...the bunks in the chat are uncomfortable and really hard to get a good sleep on.
25-03-2018T14:08:44,Vatruvius,I got nothing...just time.
25-03-2018T14:09:38,Bigboi182,"Honestly, I really need Bgr to help us out on this case."
25-03-2018T14:09:59,Vatruvius,Yeah...but he will hurt me if I wake him... :P
25-03-2018T14:11:04,Bigboi182,*sigh* Fine. We won't wake him.
25-03-2018T14:11:08,Bigboi182,Yet.
25-03-2018T14:12:29,Bigboi182,"So, how do we find out Tom's purpose."
25-03-2018T14:13:58,Vatruvius,Google :D
25-03-2018T14:15:18,Bigboi182,"Google can answer anything, but not EVERYthing."
25-03-2018T14:16:25,Vatruvius,Hmm...I am assuming that because Tom is not in a panic from me saying that that there is nothing Google can tells us that has him worried.
25-03-2018T14:16:59,Vatruvius,Well...time to bring out my coding/hacking skills. *cracks knuckles and gets to work*
25-03-2018T14:17:13,Bigboi182,Cue the montage music!
25-03-2018T14:18:27,Vatruvius,Done...the results are in!
25-03-2018T14:18:45,Vatruvius,And...I need level 500 or higher in hacking to do that.
25-03-2018T14:19:01,Vatruvius,Sorry...got nothing else. *shrug*
25-03-2018T14:20:01,Bigboi182,I was so deep in my montage that I just noticed what you said.
25-03-2018T14:20:21,Bigboi182,Probably cause I put on the Rocky theme.
25-03-2018T14:21:11,Bigboi182,"Well, there is ONE thing we can do..."
25-03-2018T14:22:01,Vatruvius,"We all just need to chant ""White Chocolate is the Worst"" over and over. He has to respond to our demands then."
25-03-2018T14:24:12,Bigboi182,Ready?
25-03-2018T14:25:12,Vatruvius,On 3...
25-03-2018T14:25:14,Vatruvius,1...
25-03-2018T14:25:21,Bigboi182,2...
25-03-2018T14:25:22,Vatruvius,2...
25-03-2018T14:25:25,Vatruvius,3...
25-03-2018T14:25:29,Vatruvius,White Chocolate is the Worst
25-03-2018T14:25:52,Bigboi182,"Welp, that sucks."
25-03-2018T14:26:12,Bigboi182,Guess we'll never know...
25-03-2018T14:26:19,Bigboi182,Sorry Vat...
25-03-2018T14:26:20,Vatruvius,Yeah...guess not.
25-03-2018T14:26:42,Bigboi182,"Wait, I thought you got kicked?"
25-03-2018T14:26:59,TheBeckoner,White chocolate is gud.
25-03-2018T14:27:03,Vatruvius,Just a simple refresh...or he trolling me. No matter...I will not go up against a ban hammer.
25-03-2018T14:27:21,Vatruvius,Not worth it.
25-03-2018T14:27:25,Bigboi182,You know what Beck? I'm not even gonna bother anymore.
25-03-2018T14:27:45,Bigboi182,"If he says white chocolate is cool, let him be."
25-03-2018T14:27:53,Vatruvius,I need to transfer these oldrim mods to SSE anyway.
25-03-2018T14:28:38,Bigboi182,"And if we say white chocolate is the worst thing to happen in years, that's our opinion."
25-03-2018T14:29:08,Bigboi182,Sorry 'bout that Tom.
25-03-2018T14:29:19,Bigboi182,We were just curious.
25-03-2018T14:31:48,Bigboi182,"In other news, are you ready for a comic stream today, or is it later on?"
25-03-2018T14:31:56,Bigboi182,This is for Tom.
25-03-2018T14:33:23,Vatruvius,Doubt it would be today...he just finished the sketch color stream yesterday. I am guessing Thursday probably...maybe Wednesday...but that is shooting high for today Bigboi.
25-03-2018T14:38:18,Bigboi182,Yeah
25-03-2018T14:38:40,Bigboi182,"Besides, I don't expect him to say anything to us."
25-03-2018T14:38:50,Bigboi182,Especially after that.
25-03-2018T14:39:10,Bigboi182,"I mean, I already apologized, but..."
25-03-2018T14:40:11,Vatruvius,He responds sometimes but I doubt he will as the whole point of removing the page stream from the schedule is because it will happen when it happens.
25-03-2018T14:40:38,Bigboi182,Agreed.
25-03-2018T14:41:30,Vatruvius,I am sad now though...:ptv-sad:...he kicked me...:ptv-whiny:
25-03-2018T14:45:56,Bigboi182,At least you didn't get the 'b' word...
25-03-2018T14:46:06,Bigboi182,you know...
25-03-2018T14:46:50,Bigboi182,"Just settle it down, and we'll get around this."
25-03-2018T14:47:30,Vatruvius,Meh...
25-03-2018T14:48:26,Bigboi182,"'Cause I've had it happen before, and I don't want the same to happen to you..."
25-03-2018T14:49:38,Bigboi182,Don't ask how... It's pretty pathetic...
25-03-2018T14:51:30,Vatruvius,Alright...I won't...moving on.
25-03-2018T14:52:01,Bgrmystr2,even though white chocolate is good? lol
25-03-2018T14:52:31,Bgrmystr2,also hi :ptv-greetings:
25-03-2018T14:54:35,Vatruvius,Hey Bgr...cheese took your fame of being the last to speak last night. Literally...time stamped 2 minutes after you last message.
25-03-2018T14:54:49,Bgrmystr2,it was not 2 minutes
25-03-2018T14:54:52,Bgrmystr2,it was 2 hours +
25-03-2018T14:55:09,Vatruvius,Was it?
25-03-2018T14:55:14,Bgrmystr2,I can still see it.
25-03-2018T14:55:15,Bgrmystr2,so yes
25-03-2018T14:55:19,Bgrmystr2,2 hours and 1 min
25-03-2018T14:55:22,Vatruvius,Hmm...
25-03-2018T14:58:52,Bigboi182,"Yeah, I saw cheese make that text this morning..."
25-03-2018T14:59:10,Bigboi182,"Bgr, We were trying to call you earlier..."
25-03-2018T15:02:25,Bgrmystr2,"I was dead to the world, don't bother lol"
25-03-2018T15:02:40,Bgrmystr2,you could ram a semi through my bedroom wall and I'd roll over
25-03-2018T15:02:57,Bgrmystr2,probably.
25-03-2018T15:03:16,Bigboi182,I don't think that your presence would've helped...
25-03-2018T15:03:38,Bigboi182,"We tried to find out Tom's ""Secret"""
25-03-2018T15:03:55,Bigboi182,And it resulted in Vat getting kicked...
25-03-2018T15:04:12,Bigboi182,So Idk how you would've helped...
25-03-2018T15:05:52,Bgrmystr2,Tom's secret is that he has no secret
25-03-2018T15:05:58,Bgrmystr2,"or at least, that's what he wants us to think"
25-03-2018T15:06:11,Bgrmystr2,You can think on that one if you like
25-03-2018T15:07:45,Vatruvius,Is it not true that one's secret is not having a secret is a paradox?
25-03-2018T15:08:13,Bgrmystr2,aaaand there lies the problem
25-03-2018T15:08:21,Bgrmystr2,Tom IS the paradox :v
25-03-2018T15:08:25,Bgrmystr2,the one that resided in the box
25-03-2018T15:12:04,Bigboi182,And the key was another paradox?
25-03-2018T15:21:16,Bigboi182,I guess so...
25-03-2018T15:21:57,Bgrmystr2,you assume there was a key
25-03-2018T15:22:01,Bgrmystr2,why lol
25-03-2018T15:22:12,Bgrmystr2,the box was always open
25-03-2018T15:28:43,Bigboi182,I blame FNAF 4...
25-03-2018T15:30:20,Bigboi182,"Anyway, I'll be back in a bit..."
25-03-2018T15:30:32,Bigboi182,Gotta finish off some things...
25-03-2018T15:40:44,Vatruvius,I will be back later as well. Really need to put all my attention into this one thing.
25-03-2018T16:02:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems like a lot happened while I was gone
25-03-2018T16:08:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I wonder if it would be cool if I requested some of the TK cast dressed as characters from StarCraft.  What do y'all think and who should each TK character be dressed up like?
25-03-2018T16:09:30,Bgrmystr2,"not really a super big starcraft person, so I dunno"
25-03-2018T16:09:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,"For example, maybe Natani as the Queen of Blades (yeah Infested Kerrigan)."
25-03-2018T16:10:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,So....Infested Natani?
25-03-2018T16:11:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,"And I think Keith dressed up as James Raynor and Trace as Zeratul.  I want to dress Flora, Sythe, and Keidran Raine as Protoss!"
25-03-2018T16:13:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think Raine would look cool dressed up as a High Templar.  And maybe Zen as a Dark Templar.  And hm....Redheaded guy dressed up as a Firebat.  or would female Clovis looked good as the Queen of Blades?
25-03-2018T16:13:59,Vatruvius,I do not know anything about Starcraft...so go for it if it is your sketch suggestion.
25-03-2018T16:14:12,Vatruvius,Hey Kiwi...how is the 9 hour shift with the 2 hours of sleep?
25-03-2018T16:14:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, the thing is: making sure I don't dressed up a TK character as the wrong Starcraft character."
25-03-2018T16:14:34,Bgrmystr2,"I'm sure if Kiwi were able to answer, they'd say it was terrible :u"
25-03-2018T16:15:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Still surprised that Hot Tub pic didn't win in the color poll.  Oh well, Fem Clovis with Keith did win so I'm happy.  :)"
25-03-2018T16:16:30,Vatruvius,I feel like the majority of people like to vote for the weird shit...or is that just me?
25-03-2018T16:16:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,No it's not just you.  I sometimes feel the same way too.
25-03-2018T16:17:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,I've been trying to get some crossover requests done (despite the fact that most crossover requests don't do so well in the polls).  Not giving up though!
25-03-2018T16:22:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,One day the crossovers will take over!   MUHAHAHAHA!!
25-03-2018T16:23:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Cough cough cough.  Man, I really need to lay off the evil laughter.  It's not good for my health!"
25-03-2018T16:23:28,Bgrmystr2,"First you need to be good at it, Palm"
25-03-2018T16:24:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah I know.  Depends on the crossover I guess.  I mean Starcraft is very popular, and so is Star Wars and World of Warcraft.  As well as Metroid.  Hm....Natani dressed up as Samus.... Evil grin."
25-03-2018T16:25:17,Bgrmystr2,"you're not good at the evil villain type deal, man"
25-03-2018T16:25:27,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, keep trying, you'll get better"
25-03-2018T16:25:35,Bgrmystr2,but atm nope :c
25-03-2018T16:26:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Nah. I'm more of the hero type actually.  Heck, I can't play as the bad guy in video games.  One reason why I refuse to play any of the Grand Theft Auto games."
25-03-2018T16:28:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,But back to the discussion.  If any of y'all wanted to see the TK cast in a crossover what would it be?
25-03-2018T16:28:06,Bgrmystr2,you don't have to be a bad guy in GTA. Not really. A lot of the games have a campaign on it
25-03-2018T16:28:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,I see.
25-03-2018T16:28:20,Bgrmystr2,and you can just drive around if you like and ignore the campaign
25-03-2018T16:28:45,Bgrmystr2,"but the whole Idea of the game is to become the bad guy, live that fantasy"
25-03-2018T16:29:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,"If I wanted to play the bad guy, I'll find a game where I can play Darth Vader."
25-03-2018T16:29:20,Bgrmystr2,I don't really have any crossover ideas that I wouldn't suggest myself
25-03-2018T16:29:23,Bgrmystr2,"also, why star wars"
25-03-2018T16:29:27,Bgrmystr2,what makes that any better xD
25-03-2018T16:29:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh?  What's wrong with that crossover?
25-03-2018T16:30:19,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed:
25-03-2018T16:30:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,You mad that Disney controls Star Wars now?
25-03-2018T16:30:47,Bgrmystr2,are you an idiot xD
25-03-2018T16:31:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,Nope.  I just like driving you crazy that's all.
25-03-2018T16:31:12,Bgrmystr2,confirmed
25-03-2018T16:31:27,Bgrmystr2,"Playing a game as a bad guy, and picking Vader as the choice"
25-03-2018T16:31:32,Bgrmystr2,has nothing to do with crossovers
25-03-2018T16:31:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Shows that I care about you.  Plus, it's fun to drive you crazy."
25-03-2018T16:31:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,:D
25-03-2018T16:31:41,Bgrmystr2,cuz there is no crossover to begin with
25-03-2018T16:32:21,Bgrmystr2,and I just don't understand why picking vader as a bad guy makes you any better than picking the guys from GTA
25-03-2018T16:32:26,Bgrmystr2,"if anything, Vader is worse"
25-03-2018T16:32:43,Bgrmystr2,that's prettymuch textbook hypocracy
25-03-2018T16:32:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well....Because I love Star Wars that's all.
25-03-2018T16:33:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,"GTA you shoot cops.  I have relatives who are cops.  So, there's that too."
25-03-2018T16:34:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Anyhow, something about the TwoKinds world has me confused about something."
25-03-2018T16:35:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Are there demons in this world?  There has to be as people have sometimes called Trace a demon, and when he summoned that dark dragon construct he said my demon, so there has to be demons in the TK universe.  But my question also asks, are these demons"
25-03-2018T16:35:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,aligned with the Masks or are they opposed to the Masks' rule?
25-03-2018T16:36:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,And what about angels?  Do they also exist in the TK universe?
25-03-2018T16:37:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,"And furthermore, are there laws against slaying a dragon?  I mean, the dragons seem to want the Templar-Keidran War to end, so it makes sense for the Templars to either:"
25-03-2018T16:37:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,"1) abolish anti-dragonslaying laws, and call open season on all dragons or"
25-03-2018T16:38:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,2) trick the dragons into allying with the Templars by framing the Keidran for assassinating a high-ranking dragon.
25-03-2018T16:38:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,"And also, why am I the only person here right now who's asking these questions?"
25-03-2018T16:40:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Okay, think we need an ask the author feature on Tom's Patreon."
25-03-2018T16:42:07,Bgrmystr2,Why would there be laws against or for killing dragons
25-03-2018T16:43:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, we never heard about there being any dragonslayers up to this point, and pretty much humans seem to hold dragons in high regard especially in the Templar Empire.  So it might mean there are anti-dragonslaying laws in effect."
25-03-2018T16:43:30,Bgrmystr2,and I'm fairly sure most of the angels and demons stuff is not really applicable to the TK world
25-03-2018T16:43:36,Bgrmystr2,and no it doesn't
25-03-2018T16:43:56,Bgrmystr2,"dragons are powerful as hell, you don't NEED a law to tell ppl not to fight them"
25-03-2018T16:43:58,Bgrmystr2,that's stupid
25-03-2018T16:44:52,Bgrmystr2,"Nora's already said that humans flee in terror at the sight of her, generally speaking"
25-03-2018T16:44:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hm....Surely there are weaknesses that dragons possess.
25-03-2018T16:45:11,Bgrmystr2,and yeah we've already seen it
25-03-2018T16:45:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, we know of one so far: drain their mana/magical energy and they're pretty much weaklings."
25-03-2018T16:45:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So, don't you think that Evil Trace might have come up with a plan to annihilate the dragons?"
25-03-2018T16:47:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I mean he had come up with a plan to wipe out the Basitins and there's still his plan for the Keidran with towers.  So, the only people who could stop him are the dragons, so it makes sense that he would have a plan to take them down as well."
25-03-2018T16:47:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,Right?
25-03-2018T16:48:11,Bgrmystr2,Why would he need to?
25-03-2018T16:48:32,Bgrmystr2,"We already know that Nora is regarded as one of the most powerful dragons in existance, if not the most"
25-03-2018T16:48:42,Bgrmystr2,and her and trace were very close
25-03-2018T16:48:53,Bgrmystr2,so there's no need for him to even look at any of the other dragons
25-03-2018T16:49:14,Bgrmystr2,"cuz they wouldn't be willing to go toe-to-toe with Nora, nevermind Trace"
25-03-2018T16:49:19,Bgrmystr2,who even Nora respected the power of
25-03-2018T16:49:29,Bgrmystr2,which is telling by itself
25-03-2018T16:49:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yes, but don't you think that eventually his shattered mind would cause him to become paranoid enough to betray his friendship with Nora to destroy the dragons?"
25-03-2018T16:50:01,TheGamePlayer,XD im using the rift core 2.0 to type im messing with the oculus rift its so cool.
25-03-2018T16:50:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,@TheGamePlayer don't mess with the rift!  You'll alter the space time continuum!
25-03-2018T16:50:45,Bgrmystr2,"and no, Palm, I don't,"
25-03-2018T16:50:57,TheGamePlayer,too bad
25-03-2018T16:51:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Lol!
25-03-2018T16:51:36,Twokinds,Targeting dragons would be a bad idea.
25-03-2018T16:51:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Anyhow, @Bgrmystr2, you have to admit that Trace prior to his memory loss was going all Dark Lord."
25-03-2018T16:51:51,TheGamePlayer,im typing via the touch controller so its slow
25-03-2018T16:52:08,TheGamePlayer,HI TOM!
25-03-2018T16:52:16,Twokinds,"Most don't care or even know about human politics. So, all you'd be doing is getting the attention of a bunch of really powerful beings that otherwise had no interest in you before."
25-03-2018T16:52:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,And why is that Tom?  Wouldn't Trace be crazy and evil enough (sooner or later) to attack the dragons?
25-03-2018T16:52:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay that answers my question.
25-03-2018T16:52:45,TheGamePlayer,OH
25-03-2018T16:52:58,TheGamePlayer,caps
25-03-2018T16:53:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Still, wouldn't Trace become so twisted and evil that he would betray Nora?"
25-03-2018T16:53:23,TheGamePlayer,wow i touch flora now XD
25-03-2018T16:53:38,TheGamePlayer,aww
25-03-2018T16:54:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,Crud.  Library is closing.  See y'all later!  Keep up the great work Tom!
25-03-2018T16:54:22,TheGamePlayer,bye
25-03-2018T16:55:26,Twokinds,Byebye
25-03-2018T16:55:55,TheGamePlayer,Tom I have a question
25-03-2018T16:55:57,Twokinds,Not even at his most paranoid would Trace turn against Nora. That's just a really bad idea.
25-03-2018T16:56:17,Bgrmystr2,yeh obviously tom
25-03-2018T16:56:23,Bgrmystr2,Nora's super powerful
25-03-2018T16:56:52,TheGamePlayer,pfff ill take her on.. LETS GO!
25-03-2018T16:56:53,Twokinds,She also can't die. So... yeah. Good luck.
25-03-2018T16:56:59,TheGamePlayer,OH
25-03-2018T16:56:59,Bgrmystr2,xD RIP
25-03-2018T16:57:04,TheGamePlayer,nvm
25-03-2018T16:57:11,BadFoMo,She can't die?
25-03-2018T17:00:01,TheGamePlayer,"XD i just booped Flora's nose, it looks way better in vr"
25-03-2018T17:01:48,TheGamePlayer,well bye everyone have a great night:ptv-hearts::ptv-greetings:
25-03-2018T17:01:55,Twokinds,You didn't ask your question
25-03-2018T17:02:00,TheGamePlayer,oh
25-03-2018T17:02:26,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
25-03-2018T17:02:56,TheGamePlayer,ya what tablet do you use?
25-03-2018T17:03:33,Twokinds,27QHD right now
25-03-2018T17:03:38,Twokinds,Citniq
25-03-2018T17:03:46,TheGamePlayer,ah ok
25-03-2018T17:04:15,TheGamePlayer,bye
25-03-2018T17:04:32,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. I could have answered that xD
25-03-2018T17:05:10,Bgrmystr2,now I double-know
25-03-2018T17:05:13,Bgrmystr2,or whatever
25-03-2018T17:07:11,Twokinds,I'm considering a 24 Pro
25-03-2018T17:07:33,Bgrmystr2,not liking the 27 eh? :o
25-03-2018T17:08:07,Twokinds,It has problems
25-03-2018T17:08:25,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, seems like from what you've said on the streams"
25-03-2018T17:08:35,Twokinds,"I honestly miss my old 24HD. If it weren't for the resolution, and how outdated it is now, I'd just get another one."
25-03-2018T17:09:16,Bgrmystr2,is the one you're using considered a newer model of the one you had before?
25-03-2018T17:10:28,Twokinds,It just came out this year
25-03-2018T17:10:35,Twokinds,It's a 4k tablet
25-03-2018T17:10:50,Twokinds,The old 24HD was 1080
25-03-2018T17:11:16,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno exactly how tablets work, but I figure it's kinda like how GPUs went from the 200 series up to like the 400 and 500 series and stuff.. the newer ones being more powerful but there's always differences"
25-03-2018T17:11:52,Bgrmystr2,"4k is super nice, from what I'm told"
25-03-2018T17:11:59,Bgrmystr2,xD haven't played with it myself
25-03-2018T17:12:12,TheDixieNutjob,I just so happened to pop in here...trying to pick out a new drawing tablet?
25-03-2018T17:12:37,Twokinds,Thinking on it
25-03-2018T17:13:17,Twokinds,Honestly the new tablets are pretty lackluster too
25-03-2018T17:13:29,Twokinds,Other than resolution they don't have anything I want.
25-03-2018T17:14:11,TheDixieNutjob,"I'm personally thinking the opposite approach, I'm thinking of going back to inking things traditionally, I thought of how I can scan 11X17 bristol and I seem to ink better that way...scaling up is going to be weird..."
25-03-2018T17:15:23,TheDixieNutjob,"*better and probably faster, we'll see"
25-03-2018T17:15:29,TheBeckoner,I just got my lil wacom intuos lol. Of course Im not creating  a whole comic and life off of it though.
25-03-2018T17:15:47,Bgrmystr2,scaling traditional art is pretty difficult. They're not drawn in vectors
25-03-2018T17:16:04,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's like.. real life
25-03-2018T17:16:06,Bgrmystr2,yknow
25-03-2018T17:16:34,TheDixieNutjob,I found a method from re-watching Mark Crilley
25-03-2018T17:17:15,TheDixieNutjob,"extremely hi-res, black and white color mode, and a TIFF file before bringing it into photoshop"
25-03-2018T17:24:19,TheDixieNutjob,oh no my plan scared everyone away D:
25-03-2018T17:26:19,Vatruvius,Hey everyone!
25-03-2018T17:26:21,JaydenMozingo,"Heya guys. Has the ""Clovis seducing Keith"" sketch been released on patreon yet? I gotta save it for.... a friend."
25-03-2018T17:26:40,Vatruvius,Sure you do Jayden...I know what you mean.
25-03-2018T17:27:33,JaydenMozingo,"Yeah, definitely not for me or anything... heh."
25-03-2018T17:30:36,Vatruvius,Hey Tom...I would just like to apologize for earlier. I did not mean to push you or anything...seemed like we were all just having fun goofing off.
25-03-2018T17:33:01,Bgrmystr2,"Nuh I'm still lurking, Dixie"
25-03-2018T17:33:47,TheDixieNutjob,"oh good, I was beginning to think I might have to commit Seppoku for jump scaring everyone somehow"
25-03-2018T17:34:28,TheGamePlayer,woah that thing makes you feel sick ima take a break and chat here for a bit
25-03-2018T17:34:29,JaydenMozingo,"Was the ""Flora and Kat in black tights"" ever drawn? Once again, it's for... a friend"
25-03-2018T17:34:33,Bgrmystr2,"if you commit sudoku, you can stimulate your mind as well"
25-03-2018T17:34:41,Bgrmystr2,mhm jay sure
25-03-2018T17:34:46,Bgrmystr2,and no it was not
25-03-2018T17:34:49,Bgrmystr2,it never won
25-03-2018T17:34:53,JaydenMozingo,Aww...
25-03-2018T17:34:53,Bgrmystr2,so it's still up for vote
25-03-2018T17:35:16,JaydenMozingo,"Oh yay! I mean, ok. thats cool"
25-03-2018T17:35:20,Bgrmystr2,needs to be resubmit as always
25-03-2018T17:35:25,Vatruvius,lol
25-03-2018T17:35:30,TheGamePlayer,XD
25-03-2018T17:35:37,Bgrmystr2,"you know if the suggestor doesn't suggest it again, then it's not up for vote"
25-03-2018T17:35:44,Bgrmystr2,"cuz yknow, they didn't suggest it"
25-03-2018T17:35:56,TheDixieNutjob,I do enough dice rolling on Thursdays as a play tester for a mecha tabletop skirmish RPG
25-03-2018T17:35:57,JaydenMozingo,yea...
25-03-2018T17:36:50,TheGamePlayer,oh ya Tom you have the HTCvive right because I saw fallout 4 vr on your wishlist and was ganna get it for you but I wasnt sure
25-03-2018T17:37:12,TheGamePlayer,that was my other question
25-03-2018T17:37:37,Twokinds,lol yeah I've got a vive
25-03-2018T17:37:43,TheGamePlayer,ah ok
25-03-2018T17:37:45,Twokinds,But you don't have to buy it for me XD
25-03-2018T17:37:50,TheGamePlayer,ok
25-03-2018T17:37:54,Twokinds,That's kind of you though
25-03-2018T17:38:01,TheGamePlayer,ya np
25-03-2018T17:38:52,unsteddyphoenix,You have a wishlist?
25-03-2018T17:39:11,Twokinds,It's just my steam wishlist he's talking about.
25-03-2018T17:39:34,iliar,@unsteddyphoenix https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/twokinds/#sort=order
25-03-2018T17:39:34,Twokinds,I use it to keep track of when things go on sale.
25-03-2018T17:39:57,TheGamePlayer,do you ever feel sick when using it?
25-03-2018T17:40:06,Twokinds,"No, not really."
25-03-2018T17:40:08,unsteddyphoenix,AHh right eight
25-03-2018T17:40:10,unsteddyphoenix,I do the same thing
25-03-2018T17:40:17,Twokinds,I don't get motion sickness typically.
25-03-2018T17:40:38,Twokinds,"The thing is uncomfortable, though."
25-03-2018T17:40:52,TheGamePlayer,i had that yestarday it was the first time using the rift and today isnt so bad
25-03-2018T17:40:57,Twokinds,I find myself reluctant to play for long periods of time simply because it's not comfortable to wear.
25-03-2018T17:41:12,Twokinds,I feel like making it lighter and easier to wear is  the #1 they need to work on.
25-03-2018T17:41:45,TheGamePlayer,I find the rift is lighter but still is a litte haeavy after a bit
25-03-2018T17:41:50,TheGamePlayer,bla words
25-03-2018T17:41:58,TheGamePlayer,Mondays am I right?
25-03-2018T17:42:24,Twokinds,"I am in an unfortunate situation right now where, due to only having one hdmi port, I can't have my vive and tablet plugged in at the same time."
25-03-2018T17:42:36,Twokinds,And since the tablet is more important... Vive has to go.
25-03-2018T17:42:45,TheGamePlayer,wait]
25-03-2018T17:42:48,JaydenMozingo,Aw
25-03-2018T17:42:55,TheGamePlayer,do you have a DVI port?
25-03-2018T17:43:00,Twokinds,Yes
25-03-2018T17:43:11,TheGamePlayer,ok you can get a DVI to HDMI
25-03-2018T17:43:14,TheGamePlayer,adapter
25-03-2018T17:43:25,Twokinds,For the vive?
25-03-2018T17:43:34,TheGamePlayer,its like 10-14 dollars
25-03-2018T17:43:38,TheGamePlayer,on your pc
25-03-2018T17:43:43,unsteddyphoenix,No VR drawing? Damn
25-03-2018T17:43:47,Twokinds,I'm not sure if DVI would have the specs necessary
25-03-2018T17:43:54,Twokinds,I don't know a lot about the ports
25-03-2018T17:44:26,TheGamePlayer,use the tablet on the dvi or just unplug the tablet when wanting to play htcv
25-03-2018T17:44:50,TheGamePlayer,the DVI is almost the same to a hdmi port
25-03-2018T17:45:49,Twokinds,I can't do the tablet on the dvi
25-03-2018T17:45:53,Bgrmystr2,DVI can push 1080p just like HDMI can
25-03-2018T17:46:00,Bgrmystr2,but keep in mind DVI does not push 4k
25-03-2018T17:46:15,Bgrmystr2,but HDMI has resolutions higher than 1080p
25-03-2018T17:46:16,Twokinds,"The tablet has dvi cables, but it outputs only HD resolution"
25-03-2018T17:46:18,TheGamePlayer,https://www.walmart.com/ip/DVI-D-24-1-Pin-Male-to-HDMI-Female-M-F-Adapter-Converter-for-HDTV-LCD-Monitor/344584681?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=7098&adid=22222222227068295997&wmlspartner=wmtlabs&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=173689173757&wl4=aud-310687321802:
25-03-2018T17:46:32,Twokinds,The tablet requires hdmi to output 2k
25-03-2018T17:46:49,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, cuz 2k is a bigger res than 1080p"
25-03-2018T17:46:52,Bgrmystr2,"slightly, but still"
25-03-2018T17:46:55,unsteddyphoenix,What DOESNT walmart sell.
25-03-2018T17:47:02,Bgrmystr2,"your face, phoenix :v"
25-03-2018T17:47:07,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
25-03-2018T17:47:08,TheGamePlayer,htcv might be slower but you could use it
25-03-2018T17:47:24,TheGamePlayer,XD
25-03-2018T17:47:56,Vatruvius,I can recommend Everspace Tom...just be prepared to die/lose progress semi-often/on the regular depending on the difficulty.
25-03-2018T17:48:01,TheGamePlayer,waiting for Robo-Recall to download
25-03-2018T17:48:45,Bgrmystr2,"Tom, if your GPU has a display port connection, you can convert that to HDMI"
25-03-2018T17:49:04,TheDixieNutjob,"Walmart does not sell model trains, that's what"
25-03-2018T17:49:08,TheGamePlayer,oh yay
25-03-2018T17:49:14,Bgrmystr2,"yeah they do, Dixie."
25-03-2018T17:49:19,TheGamePlayer,XD
25-03-2018T17:49:20,Bgrmystr2,I'ves seen em
25-03-2018T17:49:26,TheDixieNutjob,I haven't
25-03-2018T17:49:27,TheGamePlayer,they do
25-03-2018T17:49:37,Bgrmystr2,they don't always sell the same thing everywhere
25-03-2018T17:49:53,TheDixieNutjob,I'd believe that
25-03-2018T17:50:02,Bgrmystr2,it's common for most stores
25-03-2018T17:50:08,TheGamePlayer,i wonder if the rift will work with fo4vr
25-03-2018T17:50:21,TheGamePlayer,i know its only for htcv
25-03-2018T17:50:24,TheGamePlayer,but still
25-03-2018T17:50:26,Bgrmystr2,the game will say if it works
25-03-2018T17:50:32,Bgrmystr2,"if it doesn't say, then it likely won't"
25-03-2018T17:50:45,JaydenMozingo,They don't sell life-sized action figures... nevermind just saw a stormtrooper.
25-03-2018T17:50:53,TheGamePlayer,XD
25-03-2018T17:50:56,JaydenMozingo,And Vader
25-03-2018T17:51:15,JaydenMozingo,Damn Wallmart. You really DO have everything
25-03-2018T17:51:40,Bgrmystr2,not quite everything
25-03-2018T17:51:52,Bgrmystr2,but a lot of items you need for day-to-day life
25-03-2018T17:51:57,Bgrmystr2,they'll have most of that
25-03-2018T17:52:02,unsteddyphoenix,like model train sets
25-03-2018T17:52:03,Bgrmystr2,tis kind of the point

25-03-2018T17:54:58,Bgrmystr2,phoenix is being a face. Most people won't live their life in 100% emergency
25-03-2018T17:55:07,Bgrmystr2,"good, big"
25-03-2018T17:55:24,Bgrmystr2,that means you've accepted the fact that tom is always here

25-03-2018T17:55:27,Bgrmystr2,even if he doesn't look it
25-03-2018T17:55:36,TheDixieNutjob,I just realized I'm going to be late with my webcomic again due to having to redraw something and finish the rest of the linework...*sigh*
25-03-2018T17:55:39,Bgrmystr2,"not everyone is you, birb"
25-03-2018T17:55:44,Bigboi182,But I WILL ask what you guys are talking about...

25-03-2018T17:56:31,Bgrmystr2,"'sides tom, but he's a cheating elder god or whatever"

25-03-2018T17:58:27,TheDixieNutjob,hupbupbup you gotta get the joke first
25-03-2018T17:58:45,JaydenMozingo,"Hey I'm trying to paste a link into the chatbar of something I drew but it won't let me copy link, just picture. How can I get the link of it?"

25-03-2018T18:00:22,Bgrmystr2,there's too many things that you could be doing wrong
25-03-2018T18:00:26,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-03-2018T18:01:05,TheGamePlayer,like eating pizza with a fork
25-03-2018T18:01:16,Bgrmystr2,uh.. no
25-03-2018T18:01:19,Bgrmystr2,but
25-03-2018T18:01:21,TheGamePlayer,awe
25-03-2018T18:01:23,JaydenMozingo,"Well do You have any ideas? It doesn't just say ""copy link"" on it like with images from a website"
25-03-2018T18:01:24,Vatruvius,Don't dis it...some times it is necessary.
25-03-2018T18:01:26,Bgrmystr2,"I mean... if he wants to do that, why not"
25-03-2018T18:01:39,TheDixieNutjob,you only do that when the pizza's piping hot
25-03-2018T18:01:55,TheGamePlayer,no you let it sit for a bit
25-03-2018T18:02:14,TheGamePlayer,then and rach dressing
25-03-2018T18:02:21,TheGamePlayer,*ranch
25-03-2018T18:02:52,Bgrmystr2,"I literally do not have enough information to suggest anything to you Jay. xD I don't know if you're on a phone or computer, nor do I know what program you're looking at to copy said link, nor do I know how you're trying to copy it and paste it"
25-03-2018T18:03:10,Bgrmystr2,can't read yer mind
25-03-2018T18:03:40,Bgrmystr2,"I never eat pizza with a fork, Dixie. I just let it cool and eat it warm like a normal person"
25-03-2018T18:04:07,Bgrmystr2,"or hot enough to eat, but not hot enough to burn your mouth"
25-03-2018T18:04:19,Bgrmystr2,somewhere between the two
25-03-2018T18:04:28,TheGamePlayer,ever eat it with ranch?
25-03-2018T18:04:33,Bgrmystr2,I don't like ranch
25-03-2018T18:04:37,TheGamePlayer,oh
25-03-2018T18:04:43,Bgrmystr2,unless it's the lays chips
25-03-2018T18:04:48,Bgrmystr2,then those are fine
25-03-2018T18:04:54,Bgrmystr2,"but everything else, no"
25-03-2018T18:04:56,TheGamePlayer,ok
25-03-2018T18:05:07,Bgrmystr2,more ranch for you :u
25-03-2018T18:05:12,TheGamePlayer,YAY
25-03-2018T18:05:18,Vatruvius,"I had on a few occasions pizza at a restaurant where the pizza was too hot, the crust to limb to hold, and too much toppings/sauce to warrant eating it the normal way."
25-03-2018T18:05:51,Bgrmystr2,sounds pretty garbage :/
25-03-2018T18:06:09,Vatruvius,It was some of the best pizza I ever had.
25-03-2018T18:06:12,Bgrmystr2,I'd be very unhappy if a pizza I ordered came to me like that.
25-03-2018T18:06:27,Bgrmystr2,"tasting good, and being properly cooked are two different things"
25-03-2018T18:06:32,Bgrmystr2,they missed the latter.
25-03-2018T18:06:41,Bgrmystr2,cookie dough tastes good too
25-03-2018T18:06:51,Bgrmystr2,doesn't mean we don't wait till it's cooked to eat it
25-03-2018T18:06:52,Bgrmystr2,:U
25-03-2018T18:07:00,Bgrmystr2,well.. some of us :ptv-uneasy:
25-03-2018T18:07:21,TheDixieNutjob,they don't take long to bake man
25-03-2018T18:07:58,Bgrmystr2,"Oh I know, I make pizza all the time"
25-03-2018T18:08:04,Bgrmystr2,"if you want a soft crust, fine"
25-03-2018T18:08:06,Vatruvius,No...there was just so many toppings that they could not cook the middle of the crust to be crisp and hold-able without burning everything else. I rather liked it...I do not judge a pizza on weather or not I can eat if by holding it.
25-03-2018T18:08:08,Bgrmystr2,"but otherwise, crispy crust"
25-03-2018T18:08:10,TheDixieNutjob,I was talking about the cookies
25-03-2018T18:08:35,Bgrmystr2,"that's a problem with knowing how to bake it, vatru"
25-03-2018T18:08:40,Vatruvius,Soft cookies...
25-03-2018T18:08:52,Bgrmystr2,cook it at a lower temperature for longer rather than a higher temperature for shorter
25-03-2018T18:09:04,Bgrmystr2,higher temps will burn stuff that cooks faster
25-03-2018T18:09:18,Vatruvius,This is entirely subjective Bgr...I will make a note that all pizza that you cannot hold is not pizza according to you.
25-03-2018T18:09:37,Bgrmystr2,not true.
25-03-2018T18:09:47,Bgrmystr2,I did mention soft crust
25-03-2018T18:09:50,Bgrmystr2,did I not?
25-03-2018T18:10:15,Bgrmystr2,Making something bad does not make it cease to be that thing
25-03-2018T18:10:29,Bgrmystr2,"you can make a pizza badly, and it's still a pizza"
25-03-2018T18:10:30,Bgrmystr2,it's just bad
25-03-2018T18:10:36,Bgrmystr2,you can do that with any food
25-03-2018T18:11:08,Vatruvius,I disagree with the pizza i described earlier as being poorly made.
25-03-2018T18:11:42,Bgrmystr2,"If it's a cripy crust, it should be able to hold the weight of the toppings on it imo"
25-03-2018T18:11:52,Bgrmystr2,"if it's soft, it will not"
25-03-2018T18:13:15,Bgrmystr2,"like I said, things that are not fully cooked can still taste good"
25-03-2018T18:13:27,Bgrmystr2,taste isn't really a factor in that
25-03-2018T18:13:33,TheGamePlayer,all this talk about pizza made me start the oven to make a stuffed crust dizzornos
25-03-2018T18:13:39,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-03-2018T18:13:47,Bgrmystr2,enjoy it

25-03-2018T18:32:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Bakery shops should sell it
25-03-2018T18:32:51,TheBeckoner,"it isn't a petroleum based ""paint"" but It is and edible one."

25-03-2018T18:36:55,TheGamePlayer,bye
25-03-2018T18:38:08,Bgrmystr2,xD I don't look at the keyboard when typing
25-03-2018T18:38:19,Bgrmystr2,"half the time, I don't even look at the words I'm typing"
25-03-2018T18:38:32,Bgrmystr2,I just look back and read it after I'm done
25-03-2018T18:39:57,Vatruvius,lol...I don't look either but I do double check sometimes to makes sure I do not have any typos
25-03-2018T18:41:02,Bgrmystr2,"95% of my typos come from not having my keyboard lined up where it should be, so my right hand is one key off to the right or left"
25-03-2018T18:41:53,Bgrmystr2,"long as I'm lined up, I can type just fine"
25-03-2018T18:49:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I use my voice dictation to type if it’s a long enough sentence
25-03-2018T18:50:14,TheBeckoner,laaazzzzy
25-03-2018T18:50:19,TheBeckoner,I do that sometimes though
25-03-2018T18:50:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Also the squirrel my grandma’s dog caught is shaken but seems to have enough potential to recover soon
25-03-2018T18:51:07,Bigboi182,"Wait, you guys are still on about that?"
25-03-2018T18:51:44,Bgrmystr2,still on about what
25-03-2018T18:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,And I heard Tom had a secret that a few of you were trying to guess
25-03-2018T18:52:44,Bigboi182,Yep
25-03-2018T18:52:54,Bigboi182,That's didn't end well...
25-03-2018T18:52:59,Bigboi182,Vat got kicked...
25-03-2018T18:53:16,SpazztasticKiwi,He must have crossed a line
25-03-2018T18:53:20,Bgrmystr2,yup
25-03-2018T18:53:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe Tom just got a vacation trip planned
25-03-2018T18:53:56,Twokinds,"I do, I'm going to Korea this year"
25-03-2018T18:54:07,Bgrmystr2,Vat was talkin shit about white chocolate &gt;:T
25-03-2018T18:54:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m a genius
25-03-2018T18:54:24,Bgrmystr2,was a bad idea
25-03-2018T18:54:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mark mentioned that. July, right?"
25-03-2018T18:54:40,Bgrmystr2,"hope you enjoy it, Tom"
25-03-2018T18:54:51,TheBeckoner,Don't get nuked lel
25-03-2018T18:54:56,Bgrmystr2,beck pls
25-03-2018T18:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like it’s gonna be fun
25-03-2018T18:55:07,TheBeckoner,only sincere concern
25-03-2018T18:55:14,TheBeckoner,he
25-03-2018T18:55:16,TheBeckoner,heh*
25-03-2018T18:55:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark’s currently spamming my Twitter with Chico’s birthday retweets
25-03-2018T18:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,*Chica’s
25-03-2018T18:56:17,TheBeckoner,&gt;blonde doggo #1
25-03-2018T18:56:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ok, I’m turning those off for awhile. Brb"
25-03-2018T18:57:36,Bgrmystr2,so they said white chocolate was terrible or whatnot
25-03-2018T18:57:46,Bigboi182,We know.
25-03-2018T18:57:47,Bgrmystr2,aaand fail :U
25-03-2018T18:57:52,Bgrmystr2,but someone didn't know
25-03-2018T18:57:59,Bgrmystr2,and whisper went to all chat instead of whisper
25-03-2018T18:58:04,Bigboi182,No need to shout to the world.
25-03-2018T18:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I like a good white chocolate
25-03-2018T18:58:15,Bgrmystr2,"same, kiwi"
25-03-2018T18:58:18,Bigboi182,I'm sure you never put it in whisper.
25-03-2018T18:58:24,Bigboi182,Ugghhh...
25-03-2018T18:58:30,Bgrmystr2,"not true, big"
25-03-2018T18:58:31,unsteddyphoenix,I like medium to good white chocolate
25-03-2018T18:58:46,Bigboi182,I'm so tired of fighting for dark chocolate...
25-03-2018T18:58:52,Bgrmystr2,"but yknow, I guess being new to the site has's problems"
25-03-2018T18:58:57,Bgrmystr2,has* xD
25-03-2018T18:59:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m still ill with you unsteddy
25-03-2018T18:59:10,TheBeckoner,I like most chocolate. Dark is fine too
25-03-2018T18:59:14,Bgrmystr2,"nothing is wrong with dark chocolate, big"
25-03-2018T18:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And Dadrobit and Marv
25-03-2018T18:59:26,Bigboi182,I'm not getting banned a second time for dissing white chocolate.
25-03-2018T18:59:28,unsteddyphoenix,Im not ill
25-03-2018T18:59:32,SpazztasticKiwi,All chocolate is good
25-03-2018T18:59:33,unsteddyphoenix,Are you ok?
25-03-2018T18:59:35,TheBeckoner,Gimme dat baking chocolate
25-03-2018T18:59:36,unsteddyphoenix,Get some soup
25-03-2018T18:59:46,Bigboi182,or some hot chocolate.
25-03-2018T18:59:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Still annoyed at your assumption the other day
25-03-2018T19:00:03,Bigboi182,What assunmption?
25-03-2018T19:00:03,unsteddyphoenix,I never make assumptions
25-03-2018T19:00:12,unsteddyphoenix,Makes an ass out of u and mptions
25-03-2018T19:00:13,Bigboi182,*assumption.
25-03-2018T19:00:51,TheBeckoner,mptions?
25-03-2018T19:01:03,SpazztasticKiwi,We were talking about buying some merch an going to cons and I said “I need to go period”
25-03-2018T19:01:19,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah lol.
25-03-2018T19:01:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Three of you took that as something rather different
25-03-2018T19:02:04,unsteddyphoenix,This is why grammar is important kids
25-03-2018T19:02:14,Bigboi182,yeah.
25-03-2018T19:02:19,Bigboi182,Nice to know...
25-03-2018T19:02:33,SpazztasticKiwi,What possessed you to think I’d mention periods on a chat that’s 99% male?
25-03-2018T19:02:43,Bgrmystr2,yeh.. grammar tends to change the meaning of the sentence
25-03-2018T19:02:52,Bgrmystr2,"well Kiwi, you DID, the way you worded it"
25-03-2018T19:03:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially when we were on a totally different subject
25-03-2018T19:03:02,Bgrmystr2,everyone just took it as you typed it
25-03-2018T19:03:04,TheBeckoner,I mean. Anything is possible on the internet Kiwi.
25-03-2018T19:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"I ping pong in conversation, but not that hard"
25-03-2018T19:03:49,Bgrmystr2,everyone on the net is prepared for anything. so I'd definitely recommend you as well xD
25-03-2018T19:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"I keep that stuff to myself, especially with people I’ve never technically met"
25-03-2018T19:05:04,Bgrmystr2,"Always be prepared for anything, and also be prepared for people to take what you say literally, because improper grammar."
25-03-2018T19:05:11,unsteddyphoenix,s'true. People say completely irrelevant things all the time.
25-03-2018T19:05:30,TheBeckoner,Bee milk?
25-03-2018T19:05:34,Bgrmystr2,no beck
25-03-2018T19:05:36,Bgrmystr2,no
25-03-2018T19:05:43,unsteddyphoenix,Often absolutely unprompted
25-03-2018T19:05:44,TheBeckoner,aw...
25-03-2018T19:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Primarily because the chat is 99% male. Not like it’s a subject to bring up and delve into
25-03-2018T19:06:01,Bgrmystr2,Beck is a perfect example
25-03-2018T19:06:12,unsteddyphoenix,In your opinion
25-03-2018T19:06:19,Bgrmystr2,and you know.. it's not like the chat hasn't delved into those topics before
25-03-2018T19:06:20,Bgrmystr2,many times
25-03-2018T19:06:29,Bgrmystr2,and discussion was had
25-03-2018T19:06:34,Bgrmystr2,and learning was done by many
25-03-2018T19:06:47,unsteddyphoenix,Every person has their own reasoning that will lead them to saying very unique dumb things.
25-03-2018T19:07:11,Bigboi182,Yep.
25-03-2018T19:07:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re trying to tell me that having a full conversation about periods is something on this chat, I’d say your cornbread isn’t cooked in the middle"
25-03-2018T19:07:43,unsteddyphoenix,Oh my god lmao youre so southern
25-03-2018T19:07:44,Bigboi182,"I say stupid things, but I do them to be funny."
25-03-2018T19:07:45,unsteddyphoenix,Big fan
25-03-2018T19:07:58,Bigboi182,and that is the best wordplay EVER.
25-03-2018T19:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,You should hear me irl. I don’t always enunciate
25-03-2018T19:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And I talk fast
25-03-2018T19:08:24,unsteddyphoenix,Same
25-03-2018T19:08:31,TheBeckoner,yah sound like a hick?
25-03-2018T19:08:32,unsteddyphoenix,But without a charming southern drawl
25-03-2018T19:08:41,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, honestly, it's very clear you haven't been around for a while so"
25-03-2018T19:08:43,unsteddyphoenix,Im telling you that any conversation could happen and its not special when it does.
25-03-2018T19:08:52,Bgrmystr2,Believe me when I say this kinda shit does happen
25-03-2018T19:09:07,Bgrmystr2,xD Phoenix has been around even longer than I have
25-03-2018T19:09:13,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
25-03-2018T19:09:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Despite every time some chucklescmuck EVERY TIME going ""what a CRAZY WILD conversation XDDDDDD"""
25-03-2018T19:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m saying I wouldn’t bring something like that up unless it was for an educational question
25-03-2018T19:09:49,Bgrmystr2,"well, we don't know that"
25-03-2018T19:09:58,Bgrmystr2,so grammar better next time? :(
25-03-2018T19:10:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"In my experience, guys either don’t care or don’t want to heard (either because they don’t understand and don’t want to or just plain don’t want to)"
25-03-2018T19:10:16,Bgrmystr2,I mean. is just one comma
25-03-2018T19:10:24,unsteddyphoenix,"It also, was obviously a joke."
25-03-2018T19:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,*hear
25-03-2018T19:10:36,unsteddyphoenix,"We didnt actually think you were going to ""period"""
25-03-2018T19:10:42,unsteddyphoenix,didnt think that had to be said but there it is
25-03-2018T19:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Obviously
25-03-2018T19:11:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew that much
25-03-2018T19:11:30,unsteddyphoenix,Then i'd question why youre talking about this
25-03-2018T19:11:49,unsteddyphoenix,Seems very pointless
25-03-2018T19:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"At this point, just never mind - it’s getting more tiring trying to explain it"
25-03-2018T19:12:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I had to leave soon after that anyway - Bagheera started getting sick
25-03-2018T19:13:08,unsteddyphoenix,!!!
25-03-2018T19:13:15,unsteddyphoenix,See THIS is important.
25-03-2018T19:13:20,TheBeckoner,Still sick?
25-03-2018T19:13:30,Bgrmystr2,"If you knew it was a joke, you wouldn't have questioned why people came to that conclusion."
25-03-2018T19:13:38,Bgrmystr2,because obvious joke is obvious
25-03-2018T19:13:50,Bgrmystr2,I'm of the opinion that at the time it was not so obvious xD
25-03-2018T19:14:05,Bigboi182,Sometimes its too obvious.
25-03-2018T19:14:27,Bgrmystr2,some people still miss it
25-03-2018T19:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t take it as a joke. Making a period joke just because the person you’re talking to is female is not amusing
25-03-2018T19:14:51,Bigboi182,"I swear, I can take my eye off the chat for 2 seconds and so much sh*t goes on..."
25-03-2018T19:15:03,Bigboi182,"Well, there's that..."
25-03-2018T19:15:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"But at the same time, my attention was diverted"
25-03-2018T19:15:25,Bigboi182,We have to be capable of knowing who's who.
25-03-2018T19:15:32,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, it wasn't a joke about you being female, it was a joke about you missing a single comma and it changed the entire meaning behind your statement xD"
25-03-2018T19:15:42,Bgrmystr2,and you completely missed it
25-03-2018T19:15:50,Bgrmystr2,so yeh.. not so obvious
25-03-2018T19:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera didn’t get breakfast this morning because I didn’t know if it was food poisoning or virus related
25-03-2018T19:16:16,Bigboi182,"So basically, grammar sorta got you a bit triggered..."
25-03-2018T19:16:20,Bigboi182,Just a bit...
25-03-2018T19:16:25,SpazztasticKiwi,As I said - it’s more tiring to try explain
25-03-2018T19:16:41,Bgrmystr2,no explain needed. You had a Drax moment
25-03-2018T19:16:45,Bgrmystr2,no big deal :v
25-03-2018T19:16:54,Bgrmystr2,happens to everyone
25-03-2018T19:18:00,unsteddyphoenix,this cat update upsets me greatly.
25-03-2018T19:18:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"You’re likely not going to get my side of it, so just. Drop. It"
25-03-2018T19:19:16,Bgrmystr2,¯\_(ツ)_/¯ okay
25-03-2018T19:20:01,unsteddyphoenix,How spazztastic.
25-03-2018T19:20:03,Bigboi182,Fine by me.
25-03-2018T19:20:05,unsteddyphoenix,Oh! I get it!
25-03-2018T19:20:36,Bgrmystr2,xD do you
25-03-2018T19:20:43,Bgrmystr2,"but that's impossible, you're a guy"
25-03-2018T19:20:59,TheBeckoner,haha
25-03-2018T19:21:03,unsteddyphoenix,Ah damn thats true. nvm
25-03-2018T19:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,It is not a guy vs girl thing
25-03-2018T19:21:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Just goodbye
25-03-2018T19:21:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Never mind
25-03-2018T19:21:30,unsteddyphoenix,Lets just go back to talking about boobs it's all we're good at~
25-03-2018T19:21:41,TheBeckoner,Sounds good
25-03-2018T19:21:45,Bigboi182,XD not really...
25-03-2018T19:21:50,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Wouldn't the best topic be the cat?
25-03-2018T19:21:56,Bgrmystr2,and it needs to get better
25-03-2018T19:22:04,TheBeckoner,Catgirl boobs?
25-03-2018T19:22:16,unsteddyphoenix,Im am very nervous about the cat dont get me wrong
25-03-2018T19:22:22,unsteddyphoenix,It must be so hungry :(
25-03-2018T19:23:34,Bgrmystr2,I wonder if tums works for animals :thinking:
25-03-2018T19:23:49,Bgrmystr2,or if there exists something like that for them
25-03-2018T19:24:06,unsteddyphoenix,Surely.
25-03-2018T19:24:29,unsteddyphoenix,The amount some people spoil their pets there's a market for it
25-03-2018T19:26:18,Bgrmystr2,"well, if a pet is sick from food poisoning, their throat has to be in some serious pain due to bing sick"
25-03-2018T19:26:20,TheBeckoner,It's just a basic solution so I would assume something is out there.
25-03-2018T19:26:20,Bgrmystr2,being*
25-03-2018T19:26:39,Bigboi182,You don't mess around with sick household pets.
25-03-2018T19:26:51,Bgrmystr2,of course not big
25-03-2018T19:27:04,Bigboi182,Which is why we're not doing that.
25-03-2018T19:27:15,Bigboi182,We're responsible people.
25-03-2018T19:27:20,Bigboi182,With pets.
25-03-2018T19:27:39,Bigboi182,Who may or may not constantly eat all your plants...
25-03-2018T19:27:41,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: noone's said anything about messing around with sick pets though
25-03-2018T19:28:03,Bgrmystr2,so not sure what you mean by it
25-03-2018T19:29:30,Bigboi182,I was talking about my dog.
25-03-2018T19:29:46,TheBeckoner,My dogs eat a lot of grass sometimes
25-03-2018T19:29:49,TheBeckoner,not sure why
25-03-2018T19:29:50,Bigboi182,He's been eating my plants since we got him.
25-03-2018T19:30:18,Bigboi182,"No beck, I'm talking about legit PLANTS."
25-03-2018T19:30:24,Bigboi182,Big ones
25-03-2018T19:30:35,Bgrmystr2,grass is a plant though :thinking:
25-03-2018T19:30:38,Bgrmystr2,and it can be big
25-03-2018T19:30:57,Bgrmystr2,blades of grass can get super tall
25-03-2018T19:31:01,Bigboi182,Flowers.
25-03-2018T19:31:19,Bgrmystr2,ah yeah those are different :u
25-03-2018T19:31:21,Bigboi182,and other flowering plants.
25-03-2018T19:31:34,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, dogs just kinda eat whatever.."
25-03-2018T19:31:43,Bgrmystr2,kinda bothers me
25-03-2018T19:31:43,Bigboi182,He's been doing that since he was about a month old.
25-03-2018T19:31:55,Bigboi182,He's now 8 months old.
25-03-2018T19:32:04,Bigboi182,See how crazy it is.
25-03-2018T19:32:06,Bigboi182,?
25-03-2018T19:32:20,TheBeckoner,"Well mine will eat most plant like matter, not flowers though"
25-03-2018T19:32:31,TheBeckoner,simple
25-03-2018T19:32:34,TheBeckoner,burn all the plants
25-03-2018T19:32:37,TheBeckoner,easy
25-03-2018T19:33:05,Bigboi182,"My Mom loves gardening, so that isn"
25-03-2018T19:33:12,Bigboi182,'t happening.
25-03-2018T19:33:28,Bigboi182,"Plus, it's a great dane."
25-03-2018T19:33:35,Bigboi182,And I have 2
25-03-2018T19:33:49,Bigboi182,They both fight constantly.
25-03-2018T19:35:55,Bigboi182,"In other news, I wonder if Tom has ever been to Korea before..."
25-03-2018T19:36:26,Bigboi182,Probably not... but still...
25-03-2018T19:37:56,Bigboi182,Really? It just goes silent?
25-03-2018T19:38:31,Bigboi182,I thought you guys would have something to say about the Great Danes...
25-03-2018T19:38:55,Bigboi182,Unless you're looking up what that is...
25-03-2018T19:40:51,Bgrmystr2,I'm playing SimCity 4 bro
25-03-2018T19:40:56,Bgrmystr2,I know what kind of dog that is
25-03-2018T19:41:06,Bgrmystr2,"also, Tom's been to Korea before, I believe"
25-03-2018T19:42:56,Bigboi182,SimCity 4? You mean the Sims 4?
25-03-2018T19:43:16,Bgrmystr2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_4 ._.
25-03-2018T19:44:55,Bgrmystr2,I haven't played anything of the Sims series since the first one
25-03-2018T19:45:08,Bigboi182,Oh. It's a sequel to THAT franchise...
25-03-2018T19:45:11,Bgrmystr2,"I got the jist of it, don't need to play the other sim games"
25-03-2018T19:45:16,Bgrmystr2,duh
25-03-2018T19:45:21,Bgrmystr2,SimCity is the original sim franchise
25-03-2018T19:45:39,Bigboi182,I played the Sims 2: Castaway and the Sims 3.
25-03-2018T19:45:49,Bigboi182,It's not my cup of tea...
25-03-2018T19:46:11,Bgrmystr2,The Sims games are not super great cuz most of it was EA rehashing old ideas over and over
25-03-2018T19:46:25,Bgrmystr2,and expecting ppl to throw money at them for miniscule additions
25-03-2018T19:46:42,Bgrmystr2,"the first one was pretty good, but beyond that, meh"
25-03-2018T19:46:53,Bgrmystr2,it's all more of generally the same
25-03-2018T19:47:09,Bigboi182,Sounds like ALL of their sports franchises...
25-03-2018T19:47:23,Bigboi182,Especially Fifa...
25-03-2018T19:48:01,Bgrmystr2,EA has slowly gone bad ever since they changed their name from Electronic Arts
25-03-2018T19:48:19,Bigboi182,"EA have one mission: release the game, and make little changes for its sequels."
25-03-2018T19:48:35,Bgrmystr2,"not even that. Release game, make as much money as possible"
25-03-2018T19:48:47,Bgrmystr2,do as little as possible to make as much money as possible
25-03-2018T19:48:51,Bigboi182,"They're still Electronic Arts, they just don't say it as often."
25-03-2018T19:49:01,Bgrmystr2,no they're not xD
25-03-2018T19:49:09,Bigboi182,Really?
25-03-2018T19:49:18,Bgrmystr2,"cuz Electronic Arts, as a company released good solid games for the most part"
25-03-2018T19:49:23,Bgrmystr2,they had a reputation
25-03-2018T19:49:24,Bgrmystr2,and respect
25-03-2018T19:49:31,Bgrmystr2,from players
25-03-2018T19:49:48,Bigboi182,And then came Spore...
25-03-2018T19:49:52,Bgrmystr2,"when they changed it to EA, they slowly lost all of that"
25-03-2018T19:50:24,Bigboi182,I remember a time not too long ago when FIFA was fun.
25-03-2018T19:50:30,Bgrmystr2,"so no, EA is not the same company as Electronic Arts. By the books, sure, but realistically, you could change the company name and it wouldn't make any difference"
25-03-2018T19:50:43,Bigboi182,That was 5 or 6 years ago.
25-03-2018T19:52:03,Bigboi182,"FIFA 10, 11, 12 and 13 are all really, really well loved, not because they had some miniscule changes, but because they were FUN."
25-03-2018T19:52:37,Bigboi182,"And even if you din't wanna look there, look at Medal of Honor."
25-03-2018T19:52:56,Bigboi182,What the f*ck happened to MoH?
25-03-2018T19:54:05,Bigboi182,European Assault is arguably better than any Call of Duty game from the past 5 years.
25-03-2018T19:54:31,Bigboi182,WW2 Included.
25-03-2018T19:58:52,Vatruvius,"I just finished watching Mark play Unity SCP Contain Breach, I am pretty sure the chose to implement SCP-650 just for Mark."
25-03-2018T19:59:02,Vatruvius,they*
25-03-2018T19:59:38,Bigboi182,yep
25-03-2018T20:00:08,Vatruvius,That is so cruel.
25-03-2018T20:00:09,Bigboi182,Horror games have something against him...
25-03-2018T20:01:35,Bigboi182,At least they didn't curse Tom...
25-03-2018T20:02:12,Bigboi182,Or DID THEY?
25-03-2018T20:20:25,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
25-03-2018T20:20:34,Bgrmystr2,I return after making food in the kitchen
25-03-2018T20:20:36,Bigboi182,*X Files music*
25-03-2018T20:23:42,Bigboi182,"I was watching one of Mark's videos, and it gives me the question: Tom, do you curse often?"
25-03-2018T20:23:47,Bigboi182,Just asking.
25-03-2018T20:24:13,Bigboi182,'Cause Mark is a true sailor when it comes to that.
25-03-2018T20:24:31,Bigboi182,I guess you can say he's a...
25-03-2018T20:24:38,Bigboi182,Sailor Mark.
25-03-2018T20:24:50,Bigboi182,YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!
25-03-2018T20:24:53,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
25-03-2018T20:26:28,Bigboi182,Get it?
25-03-2018T20:26:55,Bigboi182,Sailor Moon ---&gt; Sailor Mark?
25-03-2018T20:27:08,Bigboi182,It's funny to me.
25-03-2018T20:28:37,Bgrmystr2,"if there were any connection between sailor moon and mark and cursing, it would be funny"
25-03-2018T20:28:42,Bgrmystr2,but there's no correlation
25-03-2018T20:28:44,Bgrmystr2,so..
25-03-2018T20:30:15,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
25-03-2018T20:30:25,Dadrobit,"Just got back from class, feelsgoodman."
25-03-2018T20:30:42,Bigboi182,Of course it does.
25-03-2018T20:31:04,Dadrobit,Accidentally spent 5 hours working on this sill project.
25-03-2018T20:31:08,Bigboi182,"Bgr, I just wanted to put in a csi miami yeah so..."
25-03-2018T20:31:08,Dadrobit,silly*
25-03-2018T20:31:18,Bigboi182,How silly is it?
25-03-2018T20:31:28,Dadrobit,Maximum silly
25-03-2018T20:31:34,Dadrobit,Except super serious
25-03-2018T20:31:43,Bigboi182,On a scale of 1 to 10?
25-03-2018T20:32:00,Dadrobit,It's my capstone project for the sound design courseline
25-03-2018T20:32:17,Dadrobit,Imagine a final test that takes you all semester to complete.
25-03-2018T20:33:15,Dadrobit,So it's silly amounts of serious.
25-03-2018T20:33:26,Dadrobit,It is one through ten
25-03-2018T20:37:38,Bigboi182,Gee.
25-03-2018T20:37:48,Bigboi182,At least you finished it...
25-03-2018T20:37:56,Dadrobit,Hahahahahahahahaha
25-03-2018T20:37:57,Dadrobit,No
25-03-2018T20:38:43,Dadrobit,"Two more weeks before critical review, then two more for final polish."
25-03-2018T20:46:58,Bigboi182,"Jeez, this is one complicated project..."
25-03-2018T20:47:29,Bigboi182,I will never complain about coursework again...
25-03-2018T20:51:45,Bigboi182,and I have 16 different pieces across 2 years.
25-03-2018T21:00:34,Bigboi182,Hello? Anyone still here?
25-03-2018T21:00:49,Bigboi182,"Oh yeah, lurking..."
25-03-2018T21:04:51,Bgrmystr2,noone's here anymore
25-03-2018T21:09:17,Dadrobit,I'm kinda here
25-03-2018T21:10:46,Bigboi182,Kinda.
25-03-2018T21:10:58,Bigboi182,I'm setting myself up to leave...
25-03-2018T21:11:16,Bigboi182,But not without a quote from tom...
25-03-2018T21:11:34,Bigboi182,But not like last time...
25-03-2018T21:11:44,Bigboi182,That was a bit crude...
25-03-2018T21:12:05,Bigboi182,So... yeah...
25-03-2018T21:12:14,Bigboi182,I'll wait for it...
25-03-2018T21:13:50,Bigboi182,Oh! I know how!

25-03-2018T21:22:06,Bigboi182,Wow. That doesn't even work?
25-03-2018T21:22:29,Bigboi182,Tom is very resistant...
25-03-2018T21:28:15,Bgrmystr2,why would you think that would work?
25-03-2018T21:30:18,Bigboi182,Idk...
25-03-2018T21:30:57,Bigboi182,Do you have a better idea?
25-03-2018T21:31:17,Bigboi182,Something that doesn't involve White Chocolate?
25-03-2018T21:33:12,Bgrmystr2,yeh I have an idea. Let's try not bothering tom and let him do what he wants to do. :V
25-03-2018T21:34:59,Bigboi182,That's a good idea...
25-03-2018T21:35:15,Bigboi182,If I wasn't persistent.
25-03-2018T21:35:36,Bigboi182,But I AM bored so I'll go with that.
25-03-2018T21:42:50,TheBeckoner,Just applied for jobs at 4 different places. Hopefully one of them gives me a call :ok_hand:
