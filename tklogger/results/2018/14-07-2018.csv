14-07-2018T11:17:43,Combak,Hi Tom!
14-07-2018T11:20:22,Twokinds,:ptv-greetings:
14-07-2018T11:28:12,Dadrobit,"Howdy, Tom. Just saw the new page, good stuff."
14-07-2018T11:28:37,Dadrobit,Forums have kind of turned on Zen though. Dude is getting some legendary levels of hate from folks.
14-07-2018T11:46:04,Twokinds,Seems like it's just one guy
14-07-2018T11:48:45,iliar,Tom. May I ask. Have dragons special ceremony when new hatching from an egg?
14-07-2018T11:53:51,CrRAR,"Haha, It's not the worst attention Zen has gotten. Back during the Natani revelations the forum discussions made him out to be THE WORST."
14-07-2018T11:53:55,iliar,If I understand correctly dragons are very rare race. So I think the birth of a new dragon may be  is a significant event.
14-07-2018T11:55:40,Twokinds,"I hadn't given it any though, but yeah, probably."
14-07-2018T11:55:45,Twokinds,Dragons are pretty rare.
14-07-2018T11:58:54,CrRAR,Do eggs incubate proportionally to how long a dragon's lifespan is?
14-07-2018T11:59:25,CrRAR,"maybe they're quick bloomer, Reni would be evidence of that I guess."
14-07-2018T11:59:30,CrRAR,*s
14-07-2018T12:01:17,CrRAR,"Though quick bloomer in growth I guess, but not by worldliness, I guess. lol"
14-07-2018T12:06:31,Twokinds,I guess
14-07-2018T12:06:38,BadFoMo,Worldliness?
14-07-2018T12:07:01,CrRAR,"xD My typing went downhill, right quick there."
14-07-2018T12:07:43,CrRAR,"""Worldliness"" ...as in how she's kind of bashful/awkward."
14-07-2018T12:07:47,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
14-07-2018T12:09:31,Combak,"Hey Tom, here's a question: Can Keirdian be Adrakists?"
14-07-2018T12:09:59,CrRAR,If you are worldly you exude confidence and seem to command control. Kinda more like Nora.
14-07-2018T12:10:11,BadFoMo,"Uh, same question but for Basitin."
14-07-2018T12:10:53,CrRAR,Basitin's lose themselves/their mind after using magic for too long.
14-07-2018T12:11:18,Combak,I'd be VERY surprised if Basitin's could be Adrakists... At least in the same way Seraphina was.
14-07-2018T12:11:32,BadFoMo,@CrRAR I don't think I've ever heard 'worldly' used like that before.
14-07-2018T12:11:49,Combak,"Then again, assuming most of it was an illusion it might be possible..."
14-07-2018T12:12:34,CrRAR,@FoMo Really? It means... like sophisticated. In what seance have you experienced it?
14-07-2018T12:12:44,CrRAR,*sense
14-07-2018T12:14:24,BadFoMo,@CrRAR I guess in part of 'worldly posesions' and the like.
14-07-2018T12:14:35,CrRAR,Ohhh
14-07-2018T12:14:39,BadFoMo,...If that makes any sence.
14-07-2018T12:14:43,CrRAR,yeah it does
14-07-2018T12:15:40,CrRAR,"Like, materialistic."
14-07-2018T12:15:51,CrRAR,It can be meant both ways.
14-07-2018T12:17:33,CrRAR,I suppose a Basitin could become a Adrakist by proxy if someone else (non-Basitin) put a curse on 'em.
14-07-2018T12:17:45,CrRAR,"If there's a will, there's a way."
14-07-2018T12:18:13,CrRAR,That'd have to be one blasphemous Basitin though.
14-07-2018T12:18:47,CrRAR,"Going against all those RULES,"
14-07-2018T12:18:56,CrRAR,How scandalous~
14-07-2018T12:20:59,BadFoMo,"Well, they could still cover their paws and the base of their tail. ...They'd just need a lot more binding."
14-07-2018T12:23:54,Twokinds,Of course they can.
14-07-2018T12:24:09,BadFoMo,Both?!

14-07-2018T12:24:49,Twokinds,Why not? That's like asking if they can get piercings.
14-07-2018T12:24:51,Twokinds,Of course they can.
14-07-2018T12:24:59,Dadrobit,"There are a couple that I've noticed at least. Amenon, Jahar, Grumar, and some general distate from others."
14-07-2018T12:25:15,BadFoMo,Yes! My request is still good!

14-07-2018T12:26:51,Combak,"Well, for one thing it seems magical, and all three races interact with magic differently... And I think a few of us are acting about the look, not just the ""worshiping dragons"" aspect."
14-07-2018T12:26:55,Dadrobit,&gt;.&gt; Need to adjust my own suggestion. Or just go back to the book club meeting.

14-07-2018T12:29:31,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit The Keith X Alaric one?
14-07-2018T12:30:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Dunno if you were around, but Tom vetoed my original suggestion..."
14-07-2018T12:30:06,Dadrobit,feelssadman
14-07-2018T12:30:11,BadFoMo,I was.
14-07-2018T12:30:41,Dadrobit,It was such a surefire vote winner too.
14-07-2018T12:35:21,Dadrobit,"Alright, here's one: ""Kat giving Alaric tutelage on massages for Keith, in the style of page 435."""
14-07-2018T12:40:33,Combak,I missed the first one. What was it?
14-07-2018T12:41:29,Dadrobit,"""Keith is sitting at the edge of a bed wearing only his ankle wraps, as Alaric, (similarly undressed) kneels in front of him, removing Keith's ankle wraps, with his teeth."""
14-07-2018T12:41:41,Dadrobit,It was too lewd
14-07-2018T12:42:07,Combak,"... If you mean the ""massaging your body with mine"" part of page 435, that's probably too lewd too."
14-07-2018T12:42:28,Dadrobit,You miss every shot you don't take
14-07-2018T12:43:03,Twokinds,-miss-
14-07-2018T12:43:13,Dadrobit,lol
14-07-2018T12:43:14,Combak,Your first one might fly if they weren't undressed. XD
14-07-2018T12:43:54,Dadrobit,"""""Keith is sitting at the edge of a bed wearing only his full winter gear, as Alaric, (similarly clothed) kneels in front of him, removing Keith's ankle wraps, with his teeth."""

14-07-2018T12:44:17,Twokinds,Nope
14-07-2018T12:44:27,Dadrobit,Hmmmm
14-07-2018T12:44:29,Twokinds,Too Lood
14-07-2018T12:44:45,Combak,"Well, that's three strikes."
14-07-2018T12:44:49,Combak,YOU'RE OUT!
14-07-2018T12:45:07,Dadrobit,Color me surprised actually.
14-07-2018T12:45:14,BadFoMo,What if the sketch has 'well placed' objects hiding the bits.
14-07-2018T12:45:37,BadFoMo,"...Also, Tom is really a Basitin."
14-07-2018T12:45:39,Dadrobit,Don't... actually color me surprised.... That wasn't a suggestion.
14-07-2018T12:45:47,Combak,... I assume that's implied with all suggestions.
14-07-2018T12:46:44,Combak,... Wait.
14-07-2018T12:46:48,Combak,LOL Robit.
14-07-2018T12:48:13,Dadrobit,I feel somewhat relegated to my more abstract #QualitySuggestions
14-07-2018T12:48:36,BadFoMo,Abstract?
14-07-2018T12:49:26,Dadrobit,"Perhaps not the best wording, but you get the idea. Stuff like the assassin kids being adopted by the king."
14-07-2018T12:50:16,Combak,"That one has been done though, right?"
14-07-2018T12:50:18,BadFoMo,"Oh, thoes ones."

14-07-2018T12:50:53,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it eventually got a Tom pick."
14-07-2018T12:51:07,Combak,"Okay, nope, cam't phrase what I want to say correctly."
14-07-2018T12:51:11,Combak,*can't
14-07-2018T12:54:36,Xexanoth,"considering the things Maddie said recently, have you tried: Alaric massaging Keiths earss?"

14-07-2018T12:54:58,Dadrobit,"Oh, and credit due where credit's due. The suggestion of Alaric removing the foot wrappings was actually from Avwolf's fanfic back in 2008."
14-07-2018T12:55:50,Dadrobit,Was hoping I could get it done and post it in his board so he'd be encouraged to actually finish the damned thing.
14-07-2018T12:55:53,Combak,"Oh, neat."
14-07-2018T12:56:09,Combak,... I guess I should go and try to find and read his stuff later. XD
14-07-2018T12:56:49,Dadrobit,"Not gonna link it here, because it's straight up NSFW, but just Bing ""Desire For Orders TwoKinds"" and it'll pop up."
14-07-2018T12:58:45,Dadrobit,"Alas, I feel it may forever more be relegated to intriguingly unfinished purgatory."
14-07-2018T13:01:06,Combak,"Ah yes, unfinished stories..."
14-07-2018T13:01:28,Combak,The stories that are perfect because you can imagine them to contain whatever you want. XD
14-07-2018T13:05:53,Dadrobit,"Huh, speak of the associated Devil. Amenon just posted a new fic an hour ago."
14-07-2018T13:07:44,RimaDraws,heyp

14-07-2018T13:09:34,Dadrobit,"Not a whole lot, debating taking the day off or not. I've already been lazy the last two though..."

14-07-2018T13:10:35,Dadrobit,"Birthday is in a week, so I dunno, I should probably stave off any more laziness until then."
14-07-2018T13:10:56,Dadrobit,Gotta make some fat stacks and keep the lights on ya know?
14-07-2018T13:11:15,CrRAR,lol

14-07-2018T13:11:30,CrRAR,Gotta keep the internet streams flowing~
14-07-2018T13:12:26,Dadrobit,Sometimes I miss having a set work schedule.
14-07-2018T13:12:37,Dadrobit,"Like, guaranteed income is actually dope."
14-07-2018T13:13:56,Combak,Just saw Amenon posted a fic too.
14-07-2018T13:14:07,Combak,Came back to see what had happened in chat to see it mentioned. XD
14-07-2018T13:14:16,RimaDraws,my art is also second job to me so i have to work two to keep extra income
14-07-2018T13:14:39,RimaDraws,no competition of course lol
14-07-2018T13:15:48,Dadrobit,"That's what I did for around two years when I was first getting into VO. Was working 40-60hr weeks in security and doing VO in my ""free"" time."
14-07-2018T13:16:12,Dadrobit,Saved up a bunch of money and finally quit to go full time a bit over a year ago now.
14-07-2018T13:16:49,Dadrobit,"It's been crazy stressful sometimes, but I needed to do it."
14-07-2018T13:17:57,RimaDraws,yee its difficult
14-07-2018T13:20:01,Dadrobit,"My folks were super supportive letting me rent one of their rentals from them on the cheap, $450 a month, so that helps a ton."
14-07-2018T13:21:26,Dadrobit,That and they didn't like how my graveyard hours had turned me into a vampire. But little did they know that working from home I'd be sporting the same hours lol.
14-07-2018T13:21:50,Dadrobit,Less competition to get gigs at night when the rest of the country is asleep!

14-07-2018T13:22:08,SpazztasticKiwi,One day I’ll stop googling stuff out of curiosity
14-07-2018T13:22:39,Dadrobit,"It's worth a read, Spazz. Avwolf is a pretty decent author actually."
14-07-2018T13:23:02,Twokinds,"Difficult? No, easy! It worked for my brother and me! Everyone should quit their jobs and follow their dreams~! :sparkles:"
14-07-2018T13:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
14-07-2018T13:23:28,Dadrobit,Hahahahahahahahahaha
14-07-2018T13:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,But are you two still gonna be at it when you’re 40 or 50
14-07-2018T13:24:07,RimaDraws,i want to make my own  comic and stories and publish them
14-07-2018T13:24:38,Dadrobit,Maybe by the time I'm 40 I can graduate from grinding stone to James Earl Jones.
14-07-2018T13:25:06,RimaDraws,"but first i need concept art done, finish the storyline, and get my art improved on style more."
14-07-2018T13:25:20,Twokinds,I don't see why not.
14-07-2018T13:25:50,RimaDraws,i just think that i can do art without getting a degree work my job i love and do art on the side
14-07-2018T13:26:01,Twokinds,"I'll probably be drawing until I'm 100. The next 100, maybe I'll work on something else then."
14-07-2018T13:26:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I remember when someone asked jack if he’d stay a youtuber till he was 90, and he said “please. If I’m still doing this when I’m 90, please someone come stop me”"
14-07-2018T13:26:29,RimaDraws,amen to that. i want to be arting till the day my time is up
14-07-2018T13:26:31,BadFoMo,I like that.
14-07-2018T13:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean, you don’t have as much insanity tied to you’re drawing so sure - if you can, go for it"
14-07-2018T13:27:25,Dadrobit,"So long as I don't smoke/drink, I should be able to keep along for another 80 or so years."
14-07-2018T13:27:35,RimaDraws,yea i quit drinking excessively and smoking
14-07-2018T13:27:41,RimaDraws,i drink on occassion but not as much

14-07-2018T13:28:48,RimaDraws,i quit smoking four - five years ago picked it up one day last year and i realized why i quit
14-07-2018T13:29:14,Dadrobit,Right on.
14-07-2018T13:29:34,RimaDraws,so i put it down again and said no more. im almost 31 i should live healthy
14-07-2018T13:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Stopping smoking is easy
14-07-2018T13:29:39,RimaDraws,noooo its not
14-07-2018T13:29:41,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad did it 3 times
14-07-2018T13:29:44,TorqueEmUp,"Once my body gives out, just put my brain in a robot or something. :P"
14-07-2018T13:29:58,RimaDraws,its hard to get rid of the feeling of nicotine
14-07-2018T13:30:27,RimaDraws,but back to arting and making dreams come true i plan on doing it. i know i can
14-07-2018T13:30:44,Dadrobit,\o/

14-07-2018T13:31:09,Twokinds,I've never been able to stop smoking.
14-07-2018T13:31:20,Twokinds,Cause I never started.
14-07-2018T13:31:27,RimaDraws,hey there you go
14-07-2018T13:31:29,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the best way
14-07-2018T13:31:33,TorqueEmUp,Ditto
14-07-2018T13:31:41,Dadrobit,"Just second hand smoke gives me a headache, so I'm in no danger of starting lol."
14-07-2018T13:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone lights a cigarette around me and I’m out
14-07-2018T13:32:12,RimaDraws,i wished i never picked it up because after you quit you still have smokers cough
14-07-2018T13:32:15,Twokinds,My dad used to smoke a lot. Camels.
14-07-2018T13:32:20,TorqueEmUp,"Though for some reason I occasionally have a dream where I am smoking, and for some reason it feels amazing. Something seriously weird there."
14-07-2018T13:32:28,TorqueEmUp,even though i
14-07-2018T13:32:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t remember what mine smoked
14-07-2018T13:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Just that he did it too much
14-07-2018T13:32:43,TorqueEmUp,never smoked a single cigarette
14-07-2018T13:32:47,RimaDraws,my papa quit when he had surgery but picked it up.
14-07-2018T13:33:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not what killed him, but everyone expected it to either be that or the drinking"
14-07-2018T13:33:20,TorqueEmUp,My father smokes cigars.
14-07-2018T13:33:22,RimaDraws,but still you never start you wont have the problem i do and have coughing almost every time
14-07-2018T13:33:23,Dadrobit,"That was my grandfather on my step mother's side. Camels for 30 years of his life. Quit for the last 20 he was around, but the cancer/tumors still came around from it."
14-07-2018T13:33:29,RimaDraws,i smoked black and milds
14-07-2018T13:33:37,Twokinds,"I won't lie, I like the smell of Camel cigarettes. To this day it always brings back memories from childhood."
14-07-2018T13:33:37,RimaDraws,loved the smell of them
14-07-2018T13:33:43,RimaDraws,oh yes
14-07-2018T13:33:53,TorqueEmUp,crazy how smells bring back memories
14-07-2018T13:33:59,CrRAR,mmm
14-07-2018T13:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,You familiar with The Fault in Our Stars cigarette analogy?
14-07-2018T13:34:36,Dadrobit,Same kind of. I'm reminded of his ranch in Cali when I smell them.
14-07-2018T13:35:00,RimaDraws,oh yes i am
14-07-2018T13:35:05,TorqueEmUp,My grandmother has smoked everyday since she was like 13 or something.
14-07-2018T13:35:12,RimaDraws,if you put in your mouth but not smoking it
14-07-2018T13:35:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Where Augustus would buy cigarettes but not light them. They can’t kill you unless you light them
14-07-2018T13:35:15,TorqueEmUp,she is like almost 90 now

14-07-2018T13:36:25,RimaDraws,no never
14-07-2018T13:36:27,TorqueEmUp,Indeed

14-07-2018T13:38:36,Twokinds,It'd be nice if I could both draw and excerise.
14-07-2018T13:38:48,Twokinds,That's the biggest issue for me. Art takes so much of my time.
14-07-2018T13:39:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Sketch aerobics

14-07-2018T14:14:17,RimaDraws,i want to do a horror based one not blood and gore but more like toward an incubus and a college girl who practices voodoo for good
14-07-2018T14:14:22,RimaDraws,stupid i know
14-07-2018T14:14:26,Dadrobit,"It's cute, but hasn't netted a whole ton of sales. Not enough for me to agree to royalties lol."

14-07-2018T15:16:55,WereKeidran,"hey y'all, sorry I'm late. Was out spending money"
14-07-2018T15:17:06,BadFoMo,Yo.
14-07-2018T15:17:10,LannAF,Power naps are insanely productive.
14-07-2018T15:17:11,ThingsAreMoving,I miss napping
14-07-2018T15:17:13,Corinthian,Heya
14-07-2018T15:17:13,Bgrmystr2,"nope, I just feel that if you have to take a nap, you don't properly sleep at night, Lann."
14-07-2018T15:17:14,LannAF,Howdy BadFoMo
14-07-2018T15:17:21,FenceEqualizer,(I don't. Just like to fake clovis sympathy)
14-07-2018T15:17:24,Bgrmystr2,"they're not productive, and it's bad for your health"
14-07-2018T15:17:52,Matth3w23,Isn't there something about our body being better tuned for 2 4h naps?
14-07-2018T15:18:03,Matth3w23,Instead of one long sleep?
14-07-2018T15:18:07,ZoopBoopLoop,Not sure if Carver or Brutus is a better Clo-TP.
14-07-2018T15:18:07,Bgrmystr2,"From what I've read, no"
14-07-2018T15:18:09,ThingsAreMoving,"depends on your sleep cycle, bgr. I usually have a 20minute nap during my dinner break at work and I don't have any problems falling asleep at night"
14-07-2018T15:18:13,LannAF,"Actually it's proven that even if you sleep well, taking power naps can help cognitive performance and helps you get through the day with more energy"
14-07-2018T15:18:20,LannAF,Most people think 2 hour sleep is a nap
14-07-2018T15:18:22,LannAF,It is not.
14-07-2018T15:18:23,Matth3w23,What about people from other countries like Spain?
14-07-2018T15:18:32,Bgrmystr2,I've read otherwise Lann
14-07-2018T15:18:32,LannAF,"45 minutes at most, 15-30 minutes is the best."
14-07-2018T15:18:36,Matth3w23,They technically nap all the time.
14-07-2018T15:18:40,LannAF,Then we disagree on it.
14-07-2018T15:18:42,FenceEqualizer,Power naps are amazing
14-07-2018T15:18:52,CrRAR,oh lol Clovy accepts his womanliness?

14-07-2018T15:18:56,BearFlipsTable,i pulled another all nighter so i thought ah heck might as well watch
14-07-2018T15:19:14,FenceEqualizer,Like those rare instances where it feels like you've napped for an hour when only 15 min has passed
14-07-2018T15:19:15,HankTheTank45,i took a nice nap yesterday after i had to get up at like 4:30am
14-07-2018T15:19:18,BearFlipsTable,shouldnt be doing that tho
14-07-2018T15:19:23,LannAF,I've taken naps myself and they work extremely well.
14-07-2018T15:19:24,BadFoMo,@CrRAR He's having a nightmare.
14-07-2018T15:19:30,LannAF,Regardless of getting 7-8 hours of sleep

14-07-2018T15:19:43,Bgrmystr2,Well it's okay Lann. I was up early this morning binging an anime.
14-07-2018T15:19:50,FenceEqualizer,Funny how when you're a kid you never want to nap bit as you get older you appreciate them
14-07-2018T15:19:54,Mippy,This is looking lovely. It was one of the better suggestions this round. IMO
14-07-2018T15:19:58,BearFlipsTable,lmao yes
14-07-2018T15:19:59,Bgrmystr2,so I'll take the blame for not having quite enough sleep as I usually do.
14-07-2018T15:20:00,unsteddyphoenix,the fact that its so happy is what makesit so SCARY
14-07-2018T15:20:03,BearFlipsTable,nap all the time

14-07-2018T15:43:34,Vexd,...that was supposed to be a whisper

14-07-2018T15:54:23,Bgrmystr2,Basically.. think of Patreon as the prude police

14-07-2018T19:16:32,Ordithus,See ya Mvilu
14-07-2018T19:17:16,BluePhantom90,hey Tom quick question. Since Daniels and Therie have like a whole fan backing for a couple. Would you Cannon the couple?
14-07-2018T19:17:24,Dadrobit,Be safe. But not so safe that you don't create memories.
14-07-2018T19:17:29,Twokinds,Everything is canon
14-07-2018T19:17:44,Ordithus,Especially the fanart
14-07-2018T19:18:48,BluePhantom90,Also Tom be careful in Califorina. Pack plenty of Hand sanitizer. Califorina is not what it used to be
14-07-2018T19:19:01,Dadrobit,Are you still on about that?
14-07-2018T19:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Why stop there? Wear a bubble suit
14-07-2018T19:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Go full germaphobe
14-07-2018T19:19:32,RimaDraws,have fun at comic con tom. wish i could go
14-07-2018T19:19:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Rei and Fluff got sick at AC, hand sanitizer and all"
14-07-2018T19:19:50,BluePhantom90,"YES Califorina has a ""Poop app"" to avoid area's with crap on the streets and roads"
14-07-2018T19:19:56,Ordithus,"SDCC means you won't be at the Friday stream, right?"
14-07-2018T19:20:20,RimaDraws,might do a day before stream like before anthrocon
14-07-2018T19:20:24,RimaDraws,maybe
14-07-2018T19:21:02,Dadrobit,It's not like Tom's gonna go around playing in shit dude.
14-07-2018T19:21:26,RimaDraws,exactly so just
14-07-2018T19:21:29,unsteddyphoenix,Gross
14-07-2018T19:22:07,Bgrmystr2,"I'll take 'Things I didn't need to see' for $1200, Alex."
14-07-2018T19:22:07,Dadrobit,"""Ohhh! Is that an open tootsie roll on the ground?"" - Probably not Tom"
14-07-2018T19:22:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“Things I didn’t need in my head” for $1500
14-07-2018T19:22:40,Glassan,That seems... odd.
14-07-2018T19:22:54,Ordithus,:ptv-grossedout: Tootsie rolls are bad enough already
14-07-2018T19:22:59,Glassan,I would assume most of it is from pets or something.
14-07-2018T19:23:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"To me, the scariest thing in Cali is the prices"
14-07-2018T19:23:29,Glassan,"Still, why would people bother reporting it on an app, rather than, IDK, just cleaning it up?"
14-07-2018T19:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve dealt with other stuff
14-07-2018T19:23:50,SpazztasticKiwi,People cleaning up a mess that’s not theirs
14-07-2018T19:23:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Funny
14-07-2018T19:24:01,Glassan,"Agreed, prices in Cali are insane."
14-07-2018T19:24:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Quick and slightly weird question - can you take a taser on a plane at all
14-07-2018T19:24:54,Glassan,"Anyhow, it was a nice stream. Now time to get back to work."
14-07-2018T19:24:59,Glassan,"And no, you can't."
14-07-2018T19:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause idk. They allow vibrators if you take out the batteries
14-07-2018T19:25:22,Glassan,"In theory, you could take it without the battery and probes, but what is the point of that."
14-07-2018T19:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Do know that I know this because it was given to me as advice
14-07-2018T19:25:54,Glassan,"It's like how you can only take the head and tailcap of a maglite, but have to check the shaft and batteries."
14-07-2018T19:26:21,unsteddyphoenix,Then could someone else take batteries on a plane? :thinking:
14-07-2018T19:26:43,Glassan,The batteries thing really depends on the type.
14-07-2018T19:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just I’d like to take a taser with me if I did go to Cali. Like a teddy bear
14-07-2018T19:27:19,SpazztasticKiwi,That can electrocute you
14-07-2018T19:27:23,Glassan,"You can put it into checked baggage, and I don't think it needs to be declared, but don't quote me on that."
14-07-2018T19:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m ready for Mule Day
14-07-2018T19:28:49,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s always this guy that sells all sorts of tasers and pepper spray things
14-07-2018T19:28:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And mini swords
14-07-2018T19:29:03,Dadrobit,"They're legal in Cali, but I'd research getting a proper weapon permit myself."
14-07-2018T19:29:55,Dadrobit,"Too high of a failure rate, and useless against more than one person."
14-07-2018T19:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,A weapon permit for a taser
14-07-2018T19:30:10,Dadrobit,"No, for a pistol."
14-07-2018T19:30:23,Glassan,"I rather dislike tasers. In close quarters, they're pretty useless, since all the tased has to do is grab you and you get shocked too."
14-07-2018T19:30:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t own a pistol
14-07-2018T19:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Mom has a shotgun
14-07-2018T19:30:38,Dadrobit,You should take some classes and fix that then :)
14-07-2018T19:30:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But that’s it
14-07-2018T19:30:49,FuryFaZeFurry,"k now im going to bed, gn"
14-07-2018T19:30:57,Ordithus,"Fun fact: bear spray cannot go in checked luggage, you have to dispose of it before leaving Alaska"
14-07-2018T19:31:13,Glassan,"Pistols, likewise, have a big risk of collateral damage, and the laws in Cali regarding them change somewhat drasticly from county to county."
14-07-2018T19:31:14,BadFoMo,Good night.
14-07-2018T19:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dude the first time I saw a proper gun “in the wild”, so to speak, I was at an ex’s house"
14-07-2018T19:31:20,Ordithus,Night FoMo
14-07-2018T19:31:28,Glassan,"Night, FoMo"
14-07-2018T19:31:45,BadFoMo,Not me. the other user.
14-07-2018T19:31:53,BadFoMo,"*,"
14-07-2018T19:31:55,Dadrobit,"Use hollow points, don't go overboard on the caliber, and train often and well."
14-07-2018T19:31:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Genius had it under his pillow and I damn near show myself cause I didn’t know it was there
14-07-2018T19:31:59,Ordithus,"Oh, in that case, never mind!"
14-07-2018T19:32:02,SpazztasticKiwi,*shot
14-07-2018T19:32:12,unsteddyphoenix,loaded at his pillow?
14-07-2018T19:32:16,Ordithus,That is a very stupid place to have a firearm
14-07-2018T19:32:27,Ordithus,"Like, Darwin award stupid"
14-07-2018T19:32:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t check. Not my gun
14-07-2018T19:32:31,Glassan,"I always preferred subtle bludgeoning devices, i.e. steel toed shoes, weighted bags, etc."
14-07-2018T19:32:35,Dadrobit,That's why we take classes and educate.
14-07-2018T19:32:44,BadFoMo,A cocked and chambered weapon.
14-07-2018T19:32:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"But he’s like, oh yea it’s loaded"
14-07-2018T19:32:59,Ordithus,Also incredibly uncomfortable
14-07-2018T19:33:02,Dadrobit,Good luck Glass. All it takes is someone a little bit bigger that can swing a little bit faster.
14-07-2018T19:33:38,SpazztasticKiwi,His dad found out he had it loaded under his pillow and he was like “what the fuck Robert”
14-07-2018T19:33:59,Glassan,"Don't get me wrong, I like my guns, but I train with them consistently, and I would still prefer a knife or bludgeoning object to a firearm at under 5' range."
14-07-2018T19:34:09,BadFoMo,I'm reminder of how my 'friend' forgot that he hid a shotgun under his matress.
14-07-2018T19:34:18,BadFoMo,*reminded
14-07-2018T19:34:19,Ordithus,"The only gun that can safely be left loaded is a matchlock, those won't go off even if you want them to :P"
14-07-2018T19:34:33,Ordithus,"(kidding, don't even do that)"
14-07-2018T19:34:44,SpazztasticKiwi,What made it worse is he had three younger siblings in the house
14-07-2018T19:34:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Two under 10
14-07-2018T19:35:01,unsteddyphoenix,thats just asking to be a statistic
14-07-2018T19:35:04,Ordithus,I hope his dad beat him verbally
14-07-2018T19:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,He sure yelled at him
14-07-2018T19:36:21,Glassan,That's why kids need training early to teach them to respect guns and what they can do.
14-07-2018T19:36:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Like I said “What the fuck Robert”
14-07-2018T19:36:35,Glassan,Like teaching them about power tools or sex.
14-07-2018T19:36:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Not entirely sure his dad liked me but he wasn’t thrilled about that situation when he found out
14-07-2018T19:36:56,Glassan,Ignorance is the most dangerous thing when it comes to firearms.
14-07-2018T19:37:20,Dadrobit,^
14-07-2018T19:37:37,Bgrmystr2,"was the safety on/off, kiwi?"
14-07-2018T19:37:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure it was on
14-07-2018T19:37:56,Bgrmystr2,then it would not have fired
14-07-2018T19:38:16,Glassan,"Well, depends on the shotgun, and if there was a shell in the chamber."
14-07-2018T19:38:20,Bgrmystr2,I'm not quite sure how it would have
14-07-2018T19:38:26,Ordithus,"Handgun, Glassan"
14-07-2018T19:38:33,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a handgun
14-07-2018T19:38:43,Bgrmystr2,"if a weapon can discharge with the safety on, that weapon is not safe imo"
14-07-2018T19:38:50,BadFoMo,Safetys can fail.
14-07-2018T19:39:02,Bgrmystr2,of course they can
14-07-2018T19:39:04,Ordithus,"Safeties are pretty easy to disable, too."
14-07-2018T19:39:15,Bgrmystr2,and that's a weapon-specific thing
14-07-2018T19:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m not sure what kind. I was too busy thinking about being that close to an unknown loaded gun
14-07-2018T19:39:18,Bgrmystr2,making it unsafe
14-07-2018T19:39:27,Ordithus,Might accidentally do that while sleeping... then the trigger is right there :ptv-nope:
14-07-2018T19:39:27,Glassan,"Ah, I was thinking about the shotgun under the bed statement."
14-07-2018T19:39:55,Glassan,"also, handguns have a few different types of safeties, some of which are not fully drop-safe."
14-07-2018T19:40:00,Dadrobit,"Aye, depending on the gun, the safety may just disable the ability to pull the trigger, but the firing mechanism may still discharge."
14-07-2018T19:40:03,BadFoMo,The best safety for a weapon is the user themself.
14-07-2018T19:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,He had two younger siblings. Even an infant can fiddle enough to click a safety off on some guns
14-07-2018T19:40:31,Glassan,"And unless there is a reasonable expectation of immediate threat, there shouldn't even be a round in the chamber."
14-07-2018T19:41:11,Dadrobit,"That's what scares me about my Glock. The safety is on the trigger. Whenever the kiddos are over, that thing absolutely goes in the safe."
14-07-2018T19:41:17,Bgrmystr2,"you know that ppl breaking into your house don't tell you when they're gonna do it so you can have your self-defense weapon conveniently loaded, Glassan"
14-07-2018T19:41:19,Bgrmystr2,that's not how life works.
14-07-2018T19:41:48,Glassan,"True, but that's why you take your environment into account."
14-07-2018T19:42:31,Glassan,"In one of my last houses, I was on the second floor, with little likelihood of someone getting to my room before I woke up and prepared, so that option worked."
14-07-2018T19:42:39,Dadrobit,I live in the ghetto. Everything in my house but the AK has a round chambered.
14-07-2018T19:42:52,Glassan,"And in Dad's situation, I would do the same."
14-07-2018T19:43:12,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, that's what I was inferring"
14-07-2018T19:43:38,Glassan,That's what I meant by reasonable expectation of immediate threat.
14-07-2018T19:43:54,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: hm okay
14-07-2018T19:44:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I can give a picture of about what it looked like but I have no idea what exactly it was
14-07-2018T19:44:26,SpazztasticKiwi,https://image.invaluable.com/housePhotos/rockislandauction/98/604898/H3925-L115656922.jpg
14-07-2018T19:44:30,Glassan,"Heck, where I live now, guns aren't allowed on the property at all."
14-07-2018T19:44:54,Glassan,"Ooooo, that looks pretty."
14-07-2018T19:44:57,Ordithus,"Revolvers often don't have safeties, just a heavy trigger pull unless you pull the hammer first"
14-07-2018T19:45:06,BadFoMo,That's no place to live then.
14-07-2018T19:45:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I’m lucky I didn’t shoot my self
14-07-2018T19:45:31,Bgrmystr2,how would you have done so in your sleep..?
14-07-2018T19:45:35,Glassan,"I would live elsewhere if I had the choice, but work keeps me from doing so. *shrug*"
14-07-2018T19:45:43,Bgrmystr2,"do you really think you would have done so, kiwi? O.o"
14-07-2018T19:45:44,Ordithus,"Sleeping people have cooked dinners before, bgr"
14-07-2018T19:45:45,BadFoMo,Dang.
14-07-2018T19:46:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it depends. Most modern revolvers that I see have safeties (my S&W does) but some absolutely literally only have a trigger."
14-07-2018T19:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I was at an ex’s house who didn’t tell me there was a gun on his bed
14-07-2018T19:46:30,Ordithus,"Well, good that he's an ex"
14-07-2018T19:46:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I can pick em can’t I
14-07-2018T19:47:45,SpazztasticKiwi,He could never figure out why his siblings liked or listened to me so much
14-07-2018T19:48:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Or how I could actually like spending time with them
14-07-2018T19:48:21,Ordithus,That's a shame
14-07-2018T19:48:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure the youngest sister just liked me because I was another girl
14-07-2018T19:49:29,Ordithus,"Aww, she looked up to you"
14-07-2018T19:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Followed me everywhere. Wanted me to brush my hair
14-07-2018T19:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Asked us one day when I’d be her new sister....
14-07-2018T19:50:14,Glassan,That sounds adorable.
14-07-2018T19:50:18,Glassan,And a little sad.
14-07-2018T19:50:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
14-07-2018T19:51:27,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
14-07-2018T19:51:51,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s basically how she was like
14-07-2018T19:51:56,SpazztasticKiwi,But without the fur
14-07-2018T19:52:15,Glassan,Sounds like she was the best part of that relationship.
14-07-2018T19:52:15,CheeseRS,nuuuuu i was afk for too long
14-07-2018T19:52:34,CheeseRS,I need a hug...
14-07-2018T19:52:40,CheeseRS,Ițll go search for a hug
14-07-2018T19:52:44,Dadrobit,Where'd Marv go
14-07-2018T19:52:48,SpazztasticKiwi,The siblings were yeah
14-07-2018T19:53:10,Ordithus,That isn't how these things usually work!
14-07-2018T19:53:13,SpazztasticKiwi,He was damn near doting to the point of suffocating
14-07-2018T19:53:16,Glassan,"Well, Cheese... *awkward friend hug*"
14-07-2018T19:53:23,Glassan,*PAT PAT*
14-07-2018T19:53:44,Dadrobit,"Speaking of doting, my cat is reminding me that it is time for food."
14-07-2018T19:53:56,Dadrobit,"So I'm gonna go make some dinner, be back in a bit."
14-07-2018T19:54:09,Ordithus,"See ya soon robit, pat your cat for me"
14-07-2018T19:54:11,Glassan,Cat definitely has their priorities straight.
14-07-2018T19:54:29,TheFDdriver,hello
14-07-2018T19:54:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Cat has mad hunger
14-07-2018T19:54:34,Ordithus,Hi FD
14-07-2018T19:54:47,TheFDdriver,how many sketches did Tom made?
14-07-2018T19:54:58,Ordithus,7
14-07-2018T19:55:03,TheFDdriver,ok thanks
14-07-2018T19:55:08,Glassan,"7, with 1.5 made before the stream."
14-07-2018T19:55:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I did run into that sister again a few months ago
14-07-2018T19:55:28,SpazztasticKiwi,She didn’t recognize me
14-07-2018T19:55:56,SpazztasticKiwi,But she was also young when I was around so
14-07-2018T19:56:21,Ordithus,"She might remember you, but yeah, it can be hard to pick someone out you haven't seen in a long time"
14-07-2018T19:56:50,Ordithus,I suspect I wouldn't recognize most of my high school classmates
14-07-2018T19:57:02,Glassan,"I bet that kinda stung. But still, having been on that side of things before, it's way better than being remembered and asked why you aren't around anymore."
14-07-2018T19:57:25,Glassan,"And you might be surprised, Ord."
14-07-2018T19:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,The oldest sister and brother were old enough to remember me
14-07-2018T19:57:41,Glassan,Some people don't change that much from high school.
14-07-2018T19:57:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Brother was 7 last I saw him and the sister was 11
14-07-2018T19:57:57,Glassan,Dang.
14-07-2018T19:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,The brother was in the “girls have cooties” stage
14-07-2018T19:58:22,Glassan,Aww
14-07-2018T19:58:32,Ordithus,I dodged that phase
14-07-2018T19:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,So while the others would hug me he was like “nooooooo”
14-07-2018T19:58:47,Glassan,xD
14-07-2018T19:58:49,Ordithus,haha
14-07-2018T19:59:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have younger siblings so it was a hoot sometimes
14-07-2018T19:59:25,Ordithus,"I'll brb, grabbing din-din"
14-07-2018T19:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,🥘
14-07-2018T20:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh this reminds me of a prank I pulled on my mom
14-07-2018T20:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"I told her “mom, I got my boyfriend pregnant”"
14-07-2018T20:00:55,Bgrmystr2,you did?! How does boy get pregart?
14-07-2018T20:00:57,Glassan,8|
14-07-2018T20:01:10,Glassan,That's amazing.
14-07-2018T20:01:17,Glassan,"I should go and get back to work as well. Tom, thanks again for the stream, and I hope you get to do something fun for your birthday before SDCC."
14-07-2018T20:01:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"To give her credit, she thought about what I said before trying to kill me"
14-07-2018T20:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Then she just gave me an annoyed look
14-07-2018T20:02:12,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-07-2018T20:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen guys try the prank too. You use the same wording and trust me it doesn’t matter
14-07-2018T20:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause the only thing they seem to pick up on is pregnant
14-07-2018T20:03:40,Bgrmystr2,my mom would probably find that kind of joke hilarious
14-07-2018T20:03:47,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s even funnier if they don’t think you have a girlfriend
14-07-2018T20:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Might bring up something like “I knew you were gay” though
14-07-2018T20:07:29,Bgrmystr2,Lol.. I've had chats with my mother about pregnant and stuff
14-07-2018T20:07:55,Bgrmystr2,"and there was one time she told me ""You'd tell me if you got pregnant right"" and I'm like.."
14-07-2018T20:07:55,Bgrmystr2,uh
14-07-2018T20:07:57,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-07-2018T20:08:03,Bgrmystr2,..yes mom
14-07-2018T20:08:19,Bgrmystr2,and she realized what she said and cackled
14-07-2018T20:08:22,Bgrmystr2,it was funny
14-07-2018T20:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,“I hope you’re not holding your breath on that one mom”
14-07-2018T20:10:50,Bgrmystr2,haha
14-07-2018T20:11:44,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom’s like “make sure he’s nice to his mom and has a good job and a set of basic skills and isn’t a yeller and...”
14-07-2018T20:12:17,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m like “Can he breathe?”
14-07-2018T20:12:53,Bgrmystr2,"Welp, I fail"
14-07-2018T20:12:55,Bgrmystr2,I yell at things.
14-07-2018T20:13:01,Bgrmystr2,I just don't like to yell at people.
14-07-2018T20:13:05,Bgrmystr2,:u
14-07-2018T20:13:16,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what she’s getting at I think
14-07-2018T20:13:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And her favorite
14-07-2018T20:13:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“MAKE SURE YOU GET MARRIED FIRST”
14-07-2018T20:14:00,Bgrmystr2,lol
14-07-2018T20:14:15,Bgrmystr2,one of my favorite momisms was when she texted me a whiiile back
14-07-2018T20:14:18,Bgrmystr2,many years ago
14-07-2018T20:14:19,Bgrmystr2,and she said
14-07-2018T20:14:23,Bgrmystr2,"""I need hungry"""
14-07-2018T20:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,“ mom I cannot get you an entire country I’m sorry”
14-07-2018T20:14:50,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall what I replied back
14-07-2018T20:14:52,Bgrmystr2,haha

14-07-2018T20:15:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Tacos 🌮
14-07-2018T20:15:22,unsteddyphoenix,:thumbsup:
14-07-2018T20:15:47,unsteddyphoenix,"telling kids to ""get married first"" just leads to people getting married too early imo"
14-07-2018T20:16:29,MarshallMelon,Honestly a lot of things about marriage are technically outdated these days
14-07-2018T20:16:31,Bgrmystr2,agree
14-07-2018T20:16:42,Bgrmystr2,ohhey it's marshall :D

14-07-2018T20:16:56,unsteddyphoenix,My sisters christian friend just got married at 20 and like...alarm bells~
14-07-2018T20:17:11,MarshallMelon,"Kinda difficult to say, Bgr"
14-07-2018T20:17:19,unsteddyphoenix,Medium?
14-07-2018T20:17:21,MarshallMelon,Let's just say there's been a reason I haven't been around
14-07-2018T20:17:27,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
14-07-2018T20:17:50,MarshallMelon,But enough about that
14-07-2018T20:17:54,Bgrmystr2,"Well I dunno yer reasons, but I like you all the same so :)"
14-07-2018T20:17:56,unsteddyphoenix,"How ironic, there's a reason I HAVE been around"
14-07-2018T20:18:05,unsteddyphoenix,(it's cause it's fun)
14-07-2018T20:18:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
14-07-2018T20:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel the hard thing about bringing someone home is going to be mom
14-07-2018T20:20:19,SpazztasticKiwi,She gonna be like 🔍🔎🔍🔎
14-07-2018T20:20:29,Ordithus,Haha poor guy
14-07-2018T20:20:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“What don’t I like about this one?”
14-07-2018T20:20:51,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I think that who you marry is your decision"
14-07-2018T20:20:53,Bgrmystr2,not your parents
14-07-2018T20:20:55,unsteddyphoenix,"""Why is THIS one no good"""
14-07-2018T20:20:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"But hey, no dad to impress so that’s a plus"
14-07-2018T20:21:05,Bgrmystr2,and whether they think they're good for you or not  is none of their business
14-07-2018T20:21:08,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's your choice
14-07-2018T20:21:22,Bgrmystr2,grown ass adult can't make their own decisions lol
14-07-2018T20:21:25,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-07-2018T20:21:25,MarshallMelon,Shame some countries didn't get the memo on that
14-07-2018T20:21:26,Ordithus,"Sure, bgr, but if the family gets along that's a bonus"
14-07-2018T20:21:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah marshall
14-07-2018T20:21:35,Bgrmystr2,well yeah Ord
14-07-2018T20:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s very much my choice. That’s why if I start casually dating someone or find someone I like, I’m not saying a word"
14-07-2018T20:22:01,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
14-07-2018T20:22:12,unsteddyphoenix,Plus people can make bad judgements about people while infatuated
14-07-2018T20:22:25,Bgrmystr2,"that's true, phoenix"
14-07-2018T20:22:27,unsteddyphoenix,"So if your parents or whatever dont like them you start thinking ""what are they seeing that im not..."""
14-07-2018T20:22:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Until he’s bought himself a full suit of armor and is ready for the dragon
14-07-2018T20:23:18,Bgrmystr2,"see phoenix, if they say ""I don't like them"" and then don't give a reason why, that screams to me I should be questioning why"
14-07-2018T20:23:30,Ordithus,"""Begone, demon, the damsel will be free!"" :fencer:"

14-07-2018T20:24:23,unsteddyphoenix,So she needs to bring home a white knight then?
14-07-2018T20:24:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll let Bagheera tell me if he’s rotten
14-07-2018T20:24:37,Bgrmystr2,hmm
14-07-2018T20:25:05,Bgrmystr2,"well, there could be scenarios where that would hurt you more than help you, kiwi"
14-07-2018T20:25:25,Bgrmystr2,"if the dude had bad experiences with cats, but he's like.. the ideal perfect person for you"
14-07-2018T20:25:38,Bgrmystr2,your cat would see his unease
14-07-2018T20:25:43,Bgrmystr2,and you'd nope out right there
14-07-2018T20:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"If Kiwi lets him pet her, it’d be a plus"
14-07-2018T20:26:02,Bgrmystr2,"Will it happen? I dunno, but it's possible"
14-07-2018T20:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I get that. Wouldn’t be the main or only factor tho
14-07-2018T20:26:34,SpazztasticKiwi,He could turn out to be allergic too
14-07-2018T20:26:39,Bgrmystr2,good to hear
14-07-2018T20:26:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's also true
14-07-2018T20:26:50,MarshallMelon,"Yeah, it's such a shame when cats are allergic to humans"
14-07-2018T20:27:00,MarshallMelon,Doesn't get enough media attention
14-07-2018T20:27:04,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-07-2018T20:27:10,Ordithus,ha
14-07-2018T20:27:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a case of that
14-07-2018T20:27:14,Bgrmystr2,are there cats allergic to humans..?
14-07-2018T20:27:21,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I presume it's possible but really?"
14-07-2018T20:27:29,Bgrmystr2,and how lol
14-07-2018T20:27:31,MarshallMelon,"Dunno, I was just doing a bit. I mean, theoretically?"
14-07-2018T20:27:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Took the cat to so many vets and treatments and tests
14-07-2018T20:27:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Cat was breaking out cause it was allergic to human dander
14-07-2018T20:27:55,Bgrmystr2,but..
14-07-2018T20:28:00,Bgrmystr2,humans don't have dander o.O
14-07-2018T20:28:01,Ordithus,poor cat
14-07-2018T20:28:08,Ordithus,uh yeah we do
14-07-2018T20:28:08,MarshallMelon,That makes sense. Functionally dandruff would be similar to shedded fur
14-07-2018T20:28:23,Bgrmystr2,"not if you clean yourself properly, Ord"
14-07-2018T20:28:25,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-07-2018T20:28:28,Ordithus,"Hair, shed skin"
14-07-2018T20:28:33,Ordithus,Skin oils
14-07-2018T20:29:09,Bgrmystr2,"your skin wouldn't shed, and hair wouldn't fall out , not with proper care, though I'm sure there's always outliers"
14-07-2018T20:29:13,Bgrmystr2,cuz soft skin doesn't crack
14-07-2018T20:29:19,unsteddyphoenix,can cats be allergic to other cats? :thinking:
14-07-2018T20:29:24,Bgrmystr2,and healthy hair doesn't fall out
14-07-2018T20:29:42,Bgrmystr2,unless it's cuz your body is old enough for that
14-07-2018T20:29:47,MarshallMelon,If cats can be allergic to other cats then they can be allergic to themselves as well
14-07-2018T20:29:50,Ordithus,shit
14-07-2018T20:29:53,MarshallMelon,And that's terrible
14-07-2018T20:29:55,unsteddyphoenix,:(
14-07-2018T20:30:02,Bgrmystr2,there's actually something I read
14-07-2018T20:30:08,Bgrmystr2,about a human that was allergic to water
14-07-2018T20:30:12,Bgrmystr2,it was unreal
14-07-2018T20:30:17,MarshallMelon,You sure that wasn't rabies?
14-07-2018T20:30:21,Ordithus,"I think one of the cats my parents had was allergic to herself, it was awful"
14-07-2018T20:31:00,Bgrmystr2,"if you were askin me, Marshall, it wasn't Rabies."
14-07-2018T20:31:17,MarshallMelon,"Well, hydrophobia can come from other things I guess"
14-07-2018T20:31:34,Bgrmystr2,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-520329/The-teenage-girl-allergic-WATER.html
14-07-2018T20:31:36,MarshallMelon,Rabies is just the most well-known
14-07-2018T20:31:47,MarshallMelon,HISSS IT'S THE DAILY FAIL
14-07-2018T20:31:58,Bgrmystr2,haha
14-07-2018T20:32:15,unsteddyphoenix,gottem
14-07-2018T20:32:21,MarshallMelon,As a brit I feel obliged to rip the hell out of that tabloid every time it shows up
14-07-2018T20:32:36,MarshallMelon,Easily our worst printed press alongside the Sun
14-07-2018T20:32:47,Bgrmystr2,"well, you can always just read the wiki about the thing she has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquagenic_urticaria"
14-07-2018T20:33:12,Bgrmystr2,"it's really sad, honestly"
14-07-2018T20:33:14,MarshallMelon,Oh huh. That isn't hydrophobia at all
14-07-2018T20:33:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's like.. really bad from reading about it
14-07-2018T20:33:54,Bgrmystr2,"sweating and tears leaves skin rash, etc"
14-07-2018T20:34:09,Ordithus,rain?
14-07-2018T20:34:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's water
14-07-2018T20:34:37,Ordithus,Damn
14-07-2018T20:34:38,MarshallMelon,Looks like it's some kind of genetic thing. Most skin disorders are.
14-07-2018T20:34:58,Bgrmystr2,So I can only assume cats that are allergic to themselves are probably going through somethin horrible kinda like that
14-07-2018T20:35:36,Ordithus,"Yeah, that kitty needed lots of medication (she hated taking them) and still had lots of issues"
14-07-2018T20:35:43,CrRAR,"The capitalization of ""WATER""... is suspicious."
14-07-2018T20:35:47,CrRAR,:thinking:
14-07-2018T20:36:12,Ordithus,Wolves Anteaters Trees Everything Really
14-07-2018T20:36:23,Bgrmystr2,"just for attention, Cr"
14-07-2018T20:36:43,MarshallMelon,What A Terrible Epidermal Reaction
14-07-2018T20:36:50,MarshallMelon,If you wanna keep it relevant
14-07-2018T20:37:18,MarshallMelon,"But, yeah, that's just how the DM styles itself"
14-07-2018T20:38:34,CrRAR,haha Marshall
14-07-2018T20:38:59,CrRAR,I was thinking it could be a sneaky acronym
14-07-2018T20:39:18,Ordithus,"Marsh's acronym is better than mine, I must admit"
14-07-2018T20:39:27,CrRAR,lol
14-07-2018T20:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is trying his best to absorb all of my attention
14-07-2018T20:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s slowly creeping his way into my lap and sprawling out
14-07-2018T20:44:28,Ordithus,dawww
14-07-2018T20:45:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Cats are liquid
14-07-2018T20:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Thay can melt and you can’t tell me otherwise
14-07-2018T20:45:32,unsteddyphoenix,maximum warmth absorbtion~
14-07-2018T20:45:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Little blanket warmer
14-07-2018T20:45:56,SpazztasticKiwi,And pillow hog
14-07-2018T20:46:21,Bgrmystr2,"had to bug out for a couple mins, someone is using obscene amounts of nail polish to paint something"
14-07-2018T20:46:31,Bgrmystr2,and it's giving me a splitting headache
14-07-2018T20:46:33,MarshallMelon,"Nails, perhaps?"
14-07-2018T20:46:37,Bgrmystr2,no
14-07-2018T20:46:41,MarshallMelon,"But like, a LOT of nails"
14-07-2018T20:46:43,MarshallMelon,All the nails
14-07-2018T20:46:45,Bgrmystr2,some kind of turkey
14-07-2018T20:46:48,unsteddyphoenix,...are you sure?
14-07-2018T20:46:55,Bgrmystr2,100% it's not nails

14-07-2018T20:47:11,Bgrmystr2,it's literally a metal turkey statue thing
14-07-2018T20:47:19,MarshallMelon,Made of nails?
14-07-2018T20:47:24,Bgrmystr2,..no marshall
14-07-2018T20:47:25,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-07-2018T20:47:26,unsteddyphoenix,Turkey nails specifically?
14-07-2018T20:47:40,MarshallMelon,It could've been made from melted-down metal ones
14-07-2018T20:47:44,Bgrmystr2,laughing makes my headache worse and I hate all of you xD
14-07-2018T20:47:45,MarshallMelon,Boom

14-07-2018T20:48:19,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-07-2018T20:48:52,unsteddyphoenix,So they're painting a metal statue that may-or-may-not be made out of nails with nail polish?
14-07-2018T20:49:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah
14-07-2018T20:49:55,SpazztasticKiwi,The workers are...gobbling the nail polish

14-07-2018T22:17:25,NightMeaty22,If it is 75° he cant sleep all he can do is yell
14-07-2018T22:17:41,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a big crybaby :u

14-07-2018T22:18:38,Bgrmystr2,"it's like laying down in bed, but w/ the breeze from the fan"
14-07-2018T22:18:41,Bgrmystr2,it feels cooler
14-07-2018T22:18:46,NightMeaty22,My bed is its own room and my dad hates it
14-07-2018T22:19:27,NightMeaty22,"I have a 3"" fan and he has 2 acs"
14-07-2018T22:20:17,NightMeaty22,I have a bunk with blankets all around the bottom half

14-07-2018T22:20:50,NightMeaty22,Almost
14-07-2018T22:21:08,Ordithus,"It rarely gets above 80 in my town, so no one has AC.  Then there is this summer... screw this summer."

14-07-2018T22:29:21,NightMeaty22,I'm weird
14-07-2018T22:30:21,Ordithus,"Being ""weird"" is hardly unusual or some sort of disability"
14-07-2018T22:30:49,NightMeaty22,I just get judged alot
14-07-2018T22:33:05,NightMeaty22,"So by saying ""i'm weird"" makes people stop it just a habit now i guess"
14-07-2018T22:33:38,Bgrmystr2,"well everyone's ""weird"" cuz no two people are exactly the same"
14-07-2018T22:33:47,Bgrmystr2,just about the size of it
14-07-2018T22:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I do wonder how “parental vs abusive” your dad is
14-07-2018T22:34:38,Bgrmystr2,well.. pouring water on someone to wake up is toeing that line imo
14-07-2018T22:34:48,Bgrmystr2,not even the military does that from what I've been told

14-07-2018T22:44:51,Dadrobit,Cooked a steak in the style of sous vide and it was damned near the best steak I have ever had.
14-07-2018T22:45:11,Dadrobit,Literally stopped using a fork and knife after the second bite.
14-07-2018T22:45:28,NightMeaty22,Now i want a steak
14-07-2018T22:45:30,Dadrobit,I am not a classy man sometimes.
14-07-2018T22:45:39,Ordithus,"If the money is going into savings, hey, that's actually smart planning (as long as you are under 18)"
14-07-2018T22:45:47,Ordithus,lol robit

14-07-2018T22:48:01,Dadrobit,I don't know if I can go back to making steaks any other way now...
14-07-2018T22:48:09,Ordithus,"Assuming Night is old enough for paid work (not that slave labor ""chores"")"
14-07-2018T22:48:30,NightMeaty22,How is everybody doing
14-07-2018T22:48:38,Twokinds,Maybe it was Rose's.
14-07-2018T22:48:39,NightMeaty22,Just wanted to ask
14-07-2018T22:48:44,Bgrmystr2,"if 18+, then he should see every cent of it"
14-07-2018T22:48:46,Dadrobit,"The two-ish hour wait time is a bugger, but goddamn if it isn't worth it."

14-07-2018T22:49:57,Dadrobit,"Yeah, vacuum sealed bag in a very controlled bed of water."
14-07-2018T22:50:14,Dadrobit,132F for 2 hours was what I went with.
