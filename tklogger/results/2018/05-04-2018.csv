05-04-2018T00:02:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt want to disturb him? Is he ok?
05-04-2018T00:02:21,Dadrobit,"Last year they had a month dedicated to Ghibli movies, that was pretty amazing."
05-04-2018T00:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And how dare you not watch Grease 2
05-04-2018T00:02:31,Dadrobit,Lol

05-04-2018T00:03:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs not as good as the first, but it‚Äôs still a part of the family"
05-04-2018T00:03:16,unsteddyphoenix,This is news to me
05-04-2018T00:03:19,Dadrobit,"Oh, and they just installed a bar too, so that's fun."
05-04-2018T00:03:20,SpazztasticKiwi,You make my heart hurt with that question
05-04-2018T00:03:31,Bigboi182,"No, I'm still in a bit of Bad blood with him..."
05-04-2018T00:03:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Does grease lightning go, go in the second one too?"
05-04-2018T00:03:48,Dadrobit,"Jeez, 32% on Rotten Tomatoes."

05-04-2018T00:04:20,Dadrobit,With Tom?
05-04-2018T00:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure I want to know...
05-04-2018T00:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,But how about the Fly and Little Shop of Horrors
05-04-2018T00:04:55,Dadrobit,All you have to do is stop fucking up. #LifeAdvice
05-04-2018T00:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"May have the first, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve seen all of the second"
05-04-2018T00:05:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a lot of horror movies
05-04-2018T00:05:49,Dadrobit,"Never saw the Fly, LSoH I watched as a kid though."
05-04-2018T00:06:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I know I‚Äôve definitely seen and own Christine
05-04-2018T00:07:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have plenty of Steven King stuff, including the Shining, which I‚Äôve yet to sit down and watch"
05-04-2018T00:08:11,Bigboi182,"Yes, with Tom, Dad."
05-04-2018T00:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,*cough* Pet Sematary 1 & 2
05-04-2018T00:08:32,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just stop fucking up. It usually helps."
05-04-2018T00:09:51,Bigboi182,"I've tried, trust me."
05-04-2018T00:10:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just double down like me
05-04-2018T00:10:10,Dadrobit,"Yeah, usually doesn't work until your mid twenties."
05-04-2018T00:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt worry - we all open our mouths only to have stupid come out
05-04-2018T00:11:37,Dadrobit,"Excuse me, but how dare you assume that my stupid is associated with my speech!"
05-04-2018T00:11:53,Dadrobit,"Most often, my stupid is defined by my actions!"
05-04-2018T00:12:09,Dadrobit,Hence: Fish Stick Burritos
05-04-2018T00:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúFoot-in-Mouth Syndrome‚Äù is like the common cold
05-04-2018T00:12:51,Bigboi182,Is it?
05-04-2018T00:13:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And I never assume where it can be helped
05-04-2018T00:13:42,Dadrobit,I consider stupid to be more of a terminal disease.
05-04-2018T00:13:57,Vatruvius,What is going on in here...hmm!? No fun allowed! :ptv-hearts:
05-04-2018T00:14:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Like that one guy that always thinks it‚Äôs a good idea to fire a firework at his own crotch?
05-04-2018T00:14:39,Dadrobit,I need the fun. Learning about dealing with lawyers in music business on the side here.
05-04-2018T00:14:40,unsteddyphoenix,I only say thing that am smart.
05-04-2018T00:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,VAT!
05-04-2018T00:15:11,SpazztasticKiwi,hi
05-04-2018T00:15:31,Vatruvius,Hello! :ptv-greetings:
05-04-2018T00:17:09,Bigboi182,It's Vat!
05-04-2018T00:17:15,Bigboi182,Hi Vat!
05-04-2018T00:17:49,Bigboi182,How's the water issue?
05-04-2018T00:17:57,Vatruvius,Did I read something about :musical_note: Greased Lightning :musical_note:
05-04-2018T00:18:12,Bigboi182,Maybe...
05-04-2018T00:18:24,SpazztasticKiwi,No idea what you‚Äôre talking about
05-04-2018T00:18:45,Vatruvius,"Water is all fixed, had a water guy come over and fill our tanks and had the well pump replaced so I got water again."
05-04-2018T00:18:49,Bigboi182,That was from earlier Kiwi.
05-04-2018T00:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I was being sarcastic
05-04-2018T00:19:11,Bigboi182,Yay! Hot showers galore!
05-04-2018T00:19:16,Bigboi182,That wasn
05-04-2018T00:19:30,Bigboi182,'t really sarcastic sounding.
05-04-2018T00:19:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unless there‚Äôs another movie with Greased Lightning in it, that was a reference to Grease"
05-04-2018T00:20:52,Bigboi182,yeah...
05-04-2018T00:21:17,Vatruvius,There is a 1977 film called Greased Lightning...it is about the first African American NASCAR winner.
05-04-2018T00:21:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Breakfast‚Äôs in about 7 hours. I need to be asleep
05-04-2018T00:22:00,Vatruvius,Also...the musical notes really show what I meant.
05-04-2018T00:22:10,Vatruvius,Well goodnight Kiwi...have fun!
05-04-2018T00:22:32,Bigboi182,oh...
05-04-2018T00:22:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"We were discussing 80‚Äôs movies, though üòõ"
05-04-2018T00:22:39,Bigboi182,Interesting.
05-04-2018T00:22:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Get that 70‚Äôs mess outta here
05-04-2018T00:23:18,Vatruvius,Yeah...way before my time. I watched Grease and Grease 2 once each and that was it. Other than that I cannot really think of any other 80s film I have seen.
05-04-2018T00:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I realize I‚Äôm in Tom‚Äôs time zone now
05-04-2018T00:23:43,Vatruvius,It was more my parents thing.
05-04-2018T00:23:47,Vatruvius,lol
05-04-2018T00:23:54,Vatruvius,Like it over there?
05-04-2018T00:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom loves those movies
05-04-2018T00:24:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if it wasn‚Äôt for the cold af temperatures, maybe"
05-04-2018T00:24:39,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôm too southern for this
05-04-2018T00:24:58,Vatruvius,lol...you are in the east now. Nothing but frigid temperatures in winter.
05-04-2018T00:25:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt see how Tom stands it
05-04-2018T00:25:34,Vatruvius,I like the cold so...
05-04-2018T00:25:48,Vatruvius,Tom has a heater blanket...he is good to go.
05-04-2018T00:25:55,Bigboi182,Lucky him...
05-04-2018T00:26:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"And he doesn‚Äôt leave the house unless it‚Äôs necessary, it seems"
05-04-2018T00:26:16,Bigboi182,He's probably out like a light.
05-04-2018T00:26:36,Vatruvius,I got a dog...I put her up on my bed like an hour before I sleep and my bed is all warm when I climb in. :D
05-04-2018T00:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Only thing I like about the cold is that the wasps die
05-04-2018T00:26:48,Vatruvius,lol
05-04-2018T00:27:00,Bigboi182,lol so true.
05-04-2018T00:27:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom would die
05-04-2018T00:27:08,Bigboi182,XD
05-04-2018T00:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Doggos make him sick, I hear"
05-04-2018T00:27:27,Dadrobit,\o/ 100% on my test.
05-04-2018T00:27:27,Vatruvius,Allergic?
05-04-2018T00:27:34,Bigboi182,Oh really?
05-04-2018T00:27:39,Vatruvius,Way to go Dadro...good job!
05-04-2018T00:27:50,Bigboi182,Good job Dad!
05-04-2018T00:27:59,unsteddyphoenix,:nerd::nerd::nerd::nerd::nerd:
05-04-2018T00:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"It might be just cats, but I‚Äôm 90% sure he‚Äôs allergic to dogs too"
05-04-2018T00:28:05,Dadrobit,EZPZ
05-04-2018T00:28:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs normally how it goes
05-04-2018T00:28:12,Bigboi182,Only 90%?
05-04-2018T00:28:23,Bigboi182,Lemon Squeezy!
05-04-2018T00:28:40,Vatruvius,My dad is deathly allergic to cats but has no reaction to the dogs.
05-04-2018T00:28:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs possible to be allergic to just the one, I guess. I‚Äôm not a doctor, so idk"
05-04-2018T00:30:17,Bigboi182,I see...
05-04-2018T00:30:30,Bigboi182,Good thing I don't have any allergies!
05-04-2018T00:31:08,Vatruvius,I don't have any allergies either. :D
05-04-2018T00:32:02,Dadrobit,Now I gots to go write a report on the pros and cons of various contract dealings between artists/publishers/labels. Fun fun fun.
05-04-2018T00:32:15,Vatruvius,lol
05-04-2018T00:32:25,Vatruvius,Only the most interesting of subjects Dadro.
05-04-2018T00:32:35,Dadrobit,"And all of you people withough allergies, may you suffer head colds unending."
05-04-2018T00:32:35,unsteddyphoenix,wooohoo~

05-04-2018T00:33:02,unsteddyphoenix,I look upon you defective humans with pity
05-04-2018T00:33:06,unsteddyphoenix,And a hint of contempt
05-04-2018T00:33:19,Vatruvius,That is not very nice...I may not get allergies but I am celiac so...
05-04-2018T00:33:26,unsteddyphoenix,Wait actually shit I am allergic to something I just remembered
05-04-2018T00:33:53,unsteddyphoenix,I developed a reaction to my acne meds once.
05-04-2018T00:34:07,unsteddyphoenix,Nvm im one of you
05-04-2018T00:34:48,Bigboi182,Haha!
05-04-2018T00:34:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm allergic to stupid. I break out in sarcasm
05-04-2018T00:34:57,Bigboi182,I am perfectly CLEAN.
05-04-2018T00:35:03,Vatruvius,Don't think medicine allergies count...but I have only one wait...I have a lot of medicine I cannot take. One because I am allergic and a lot others that could kill me.
05-04-2018T00:35:09,Bigboi182,XD Kiwi
05-04-2018T00:35:24,Dadrobit,I'm allergic to literally every grass and weed in AZ all year round.
05-04-2018T00:35:28,Dadrobit,It blooooooooooooows
05-04-2018T00:35:40,Bigboi182,wow.
05-04-2018T00:35:41,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
05-04-2018T00:35:44,Vatruvius,Wait...so you thought I was stupid earlier? :ptv-whiny:
05-04-2018T00:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm not supposed to have greasy, spicy, overly salty/sugary foods though. That count?"
05-04-2018T00:36:07,Bigboi182,Kinda.
05-04-2018T00:36:09,Vatruvius,Why not?
05-04-2018T00:36:12,Dadrobit,"Not really, most of us shouldn't/"
05-04-2018T00:36:41,SpazztasticKiwi,We were discussing allergies. I break out into random sarcasm often though
05-04-2018T00:36:41,Bigboi182,"Then again, that's more of a diet than an allergy..."
05-04-2018T00:37:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Not just because of stupidity
05-04-2018T00:37:31,Vatruvius,Okay...good. :ptv-snicker:
05-04-2018T00:37:41,Bigboi182,"In unrelated news, this rap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIBsLHa4On0"
05-04-2018T00:37:54,Dadrobit,&gt;.&gt; I need to go on a diet again.... Pushing 190 now....
05-04-2018T00:38:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom seems to break out into random sarcasm too
05-04-2018T00:38:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Like it‚Äôs a habit
05-04-2018T00:38:29,unsteddyphoenix,sarcasm is pretty rude you guys should stop :/
05-04-2018T00:39:25,Bigboi182,"When it's needed, it works."
05-04-2018T00:39:47,Vatruvius,190...you weigh less than me Dadro
05-04-2018T00:39:48,Bigboi182,"Nah Kiwi, Tom just likes to keep us guessing."
05-04-2018T00:40:08,Vatruvius,"Also...I should specify. This kind of ""good"" at 13:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4O9rMQ-TlU"
05-04-2018T00:41:27,Dadrobit,I try to keep myself in the low 180's.
05-04-2018T00:42:19,Vatruvius,I am actually going to start exercising soon. Need to lose this extra weight.
05-04-2018T00:42:41,Dadrobit,Diet &gt; Exercise for weight loss.
05-04-2018T00:43:02,Vatruvius,I don't allow myself to buy new cloths if I get to big...just a sign to get back into shape. If I buy new cloths I will just perpetuate the problem.
05-04-2018T00:43:30,Vatruvius,This is true Dadro...so my exercise also includes a change in diet.
05-04-2018T00:43:34,Dadrobit,"Gotta do both, but monitoring what gets shoved down your throat is super important in realizing the loos."
05-04-2018T00:43:36,Dadrobit,loss*
05-04-2018T00:44:46,Dadrobit,"TBH, I've been getting lazy for a solid almost year now. Ever since I got out of security, missing a workout has turned into a ""meh, whatever"" mentality."
05-04-2018T00:44:48,Vatruvius,I lost a lot of weight when I was in college because I could not eat most of the food they offered there. But at home I gain weight because that are just too many tasty home cooked meals. Need to watch my portions...that is my problem.
05-04-2018T00:44:50,Dadrobit,BadRobit
05-04-2018T00:45:05,Vatruvius,lol
05-04-2018T00:45:45,Vatruvius,Need to stop going for seconds and thirds.
05-04-2018T00:46:27,unsteddyphoenix,dont beat yourself up you'll make me sadrobit
05-04-2018T00:47:12,Vatruvius,Only Dadrobit can say that.
05-04-2018T00:47:23,Bigboi182,"yeah, I'm outta here."
05-04-2018T00:47:45,Bigboi182,see y'all tomorrow.
05-04-2018T00:47:49,Vatruvius,Bye Bigboi.
05-04-2018T00:47:57,Bigboi182,Bye guys!
05-04-2018T00:48:15,Dadrobit,cya boi
05-04-2018T00:48:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,See ya big
05-04-2018T00:51:21,NightMeaty22,that moment when you cant sleep and you want to smash your head on the wall
05-04-2018T00:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"If 190 is tiny to you, what‚Äôs 140?"
05-04-2018T00:52:15,NightMeaty22,what¬°¬ø
05-04-2018T00:52:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause I‚Äôm technically supposed to be 130, but 140‚Äôs what I‚Äôve gotten down to so far"
05-04-2018T00:52:44,Vatruvius,Never been except for when I have a fever which sleep is the least of my worries.
05-04-2018T00:52:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Granted I‚Äôm also shorter
05-04-2018T00:53:03,Vatruvius,Why are you suppose to be ?
05-04-2018T00:53:09,Vatruvius,130*
05-04-2018T00:53:28,Vatruvius,What is your height?
05-04-2018T00:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs the expected, ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù weight for my age and height, 5‚Äù5ish"
05-04-2018T00:54:44,Vatruvius,Hmm...I definitely need to lose a good 10 pounds but I am also stockier then most men my age. Just part of my genes.
05-04-2018T00:56:55,Vatruvius,What happened to going to bed Kiwi?
05-04-2018T00:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Internet connection

05-04-2018T00:58:19,Vatruvius,Try turning off the power...that tends to sever the internet connection.
05-04-2018T00:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I need my phone though
05-04-2018T00:59:32,Vatruvius,I am sure you will need your phone to have a full battery and be at full functional capacity for you day tomorrow/today. However late it is over there.
05-04-2018T00:59:51,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs on the charger
05-04-2018T01:00:17,NightMeaty22,where is it
05-04-2018T01:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Next to the bed
05-04-2018T01:00:56,NightMeaty22,move it to another room if you need to
05-04-2018T01:01:05,NightMeaty22,good morning btw
05-04-2018T01:01:12,Vatruvius,"But it is not off, clearing it's cache and resetting the OS.. A device that does not restart/turn off in a while will slow down and perform worse."

05-04-2018T01:03:05,NightMeaty22,what if i cant sleep
05-04-2018T01:03:22,Dadrobit,"Lol, reading other's essays on contractual agreements and I swear to goodness, legitimately 98% of them are all just talking about how they would ""never sell out to a 360 contract""."
05-04-2018T01:03:53,unsteddyphoenix,Careful with that language
05-04-2018T01:03:53,Vatruvius,A 360 contract?
05-04-2018T01:04:04,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like you should also write that
05-04-2018T01:04:12,unsteddyphoenix,Stick to the status quo
05-04-2018T01:04:16,Dadrobit,"It's not selling out kiddos, it's buying in. If you want to sit at the big boy's poker table, you got to put down some big chips."
05-04-2018T01:04:48,Vatruvius,I didn't realise Dadro...how lewd of you to speak this way. Contractual agreements turn me on. :ptv-hearts:

05-04-2018T01:05:42,Vatruvius,All that goes straight to the gut/butt Meaty.
05-04-2018T01:05:52,Vatruvius,At this time of the night.
05-04-2018T01:06:00,NightMeaty22,um
05-04-2018T01:06:02,NightMeaty22,...
05-04-2018T01:06:08,Dadrobit,"Essentially, a 360 contract is one where the label pays the artist up front and funds their recordings, promotions, and most of not all expenses for live performances, but the artist gives up a lot of their copyright ownership and a % of earnings for musi"
05-04-2018T01:06:13,Dadrobit,music sales
05-04-2018T01:06:24,Dadrobit,of if not al*
05-04-2018T01:06:27,Dadrobit,all**
05-04-2018T01:06:50,Vatruvius,Oh...I am no specialist but that sounds like that would hurt my as an artist in the long run.

05-04-2018T01:07:01,Vatruvius,me*
05-04-2018T01:07:06,unsteddyphoenix,So the label does most of the work and keeps most of the money?
05-04-2018T01:07:21,NightMeaty22,üë®‚Äçüé®
05-04-2018T01:07:33,Dadrobit,"That's the exact reasoning from the label's point of view, yes."
05-04-2018T01:08:37,unsteddyphoenix,Eh i'd sign it
05-04-2018T01:08:39,Dadrobit,"@Vat, that's why you get a good lawyer who will get you a ""Sunset Clause"" in your contract so that you can exit gracefully when you feel you've grown as an artist to the point that you can support yourself."
05-04-2018T01:08:39,unsteddyphoenix,Nice and lazy~
05-04-2018T01:08:54,Bgrmystr2,giving up ownership is not one of the things I'd ever agree with. They do most of the work and get most of the money. Sure. Fine. Why do they get most of the ownership too?
05-04-2018T01:09:27,Bgrmystr2,they didn't do jack shit to get any part of the ownership.
05-04-2018T01:09:30,Bgrmystr2,Zero.
05-04-2018T01:09:45,Vatruvius,Yeah...that is what I would do. Contact a lawyer and ask how to I make this agreement work in my favor.
05-04-2018T01:09:46,Dadrobit,"The problems arise when artists get locked in too heavily and they lose too much artistic creativity. As in ""We'll pay for your promotional material, but this is how you have to look/act"""
05-04-2018T01:10:03,Vatruvius,That is just shitty.
05-04-2018T01:10:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah I'd never agree with being a slave to a company just so they make money off what they want me to be.
05-04-2018T01:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Y‚Äôall need to stop this late night sexy talk
05-04-2018T01:10:38,Dadrobit,Labes do a ton of work yo. Recording a hit song isn't exactly the easiest or cheapest thing in the world.
05-04-2018T01:10:39,Vatruvius,lol
05-04-2018T01:10:40,unsteddyphoenix,That is the ideal time for sexy talk

05-04-2018T01:12:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya
05-04-2018T01:13:19,Bgrmystr2,And that's why they get most of the money. They don't deserve most of the ownership
05-04-2018T01:13:26,Bgrmystr2,"or any of it, honestly."
05-04-2018T01:14:23,Dadrobit,"At least partial song recording ownership automaticaly goes to the label regardless, s'how copyright works. This just gives a bit more."
05-04-2018T01:15:20,Dadrobit,"The artist created and wrote down a song, they own that as a copyright, but in recording, the label participated in the act of creating the recording and thus own a part of that copyright."
05-04-2018T01:15:29,Dadrobit,Two different things.
05-04-2018T01:16:28,Bgrmystr2,"So they would own a part of the copyright of the recording, because that was a part that they took part in"
05-04-2018T01:16:31,Bgrmystr2,I can understand that
05-04-2018T01:16:38,Bgrmystr2,"but from what I've seen, it's not just that."
05-04-2018T01:16:41,unsteddyphoenix,https://imgur.com/MAiIwW8
05-04-2018T01:16:43,Dadrobit,And the 360 just gives them more of that.
05-04-2018T01:17:00,Dadrobit,"Ayyyy, dat kitten tho"
05-04-2018T01:17:04,Bgrmystr2,"What I've seen, they get ownership of the actual creation."
05-04-2018T01:17:13,Bgrmystr2,"either partial, or majority"
05-04-2018T01:17:31,Dadrobit,"It's important to be specific, the song, or the recoring of the song?"
05-04-2018T01:17:32,Bgrmystr2,and the creator can get removed from what they themselves created.
05-04-2018T01:17:38,Bgrmystr2,the song itself
05-04-2018T01:17:41,Dadrobit,recording*
05-04-2018T01:18:48,Vatruvius,From what my professor told me...record companies are the scum of the earth for the bullshit copyright bans and stuff they do to everyone.
05-04-2018T01:18:56,Dadrobit,"Eh, if that's part of the deal, then you either need a better lawyer, or your lawyer better net you better gains elsewhere. But very very rarely does an artist ever have their song rights taken away."
05-04-2018T01:19:22,Dadrobit,"They can definitely be bought, but that's up to the artist."
05-04-2018T01:19:28,NightMeaty22,the bank owns you rember that
05-04-2018T01:19:41,Vatruvius,Not if you are smart Meaty.
05-04-2018T01:19:42,Bgrmystr2,"Basically the same for recording labels, Night"
05-04-2018T01:20:04,Dadrobit,"And in band situations where partial ownership is delegated to several members, and then some of those members sell their share to a label, it can get messy."
05-04-2018T01:20:05,NightMeaty22,control the money control the people
05-04-2018T01:20:23,NightMeaty22,control the people control the world

05-04-2018T01:20:48,Dadrobit,"Nah, that ""Where's the fair use?"" fad on youtube was a bunch of bullshit tbh."
05-04-2018T01:21:10,Dadrobit,I'm assuming that's what  you're talking about Vat?
05-04-2018T01:21:31,NightMeaty22,the illuminati it real
05-04-2018T01:21:44,Bgrmystr2,"That wasn't a fad, Dadro, if you actually looked at what happened"
05-04-2018T01:22:16,Dadrobit,What a bunch of uneducated people not understanding copyright law?
05-04-2018T01:22:20,Dadrobit,Go figure
05-04-2018T01:22:40,Bgrmystr2,Because fair use is super complicated xD
05-04-2018T01:22:50,Dadrobit,"Just because you say you're using something ""under fair-use"" does not mean it's actually faiir use."
05-04-2018T01:22:56,Dadrobit,fair*
05-04-2018T01:23:04,Vatruvius,Hmm...I am not talking about anything. You mean record companies being bullshit...I know a record company sued a youtube channel because they posted a video of part of a movie that had their licensed music in it except the point of the video was that
05-04-2018T01:23:12,Vatruvius,they took out the music.
05-04-2018T01:23:23,Vatruvius,So they sued for the lack of their licensed music.
05-04-2018T01:23:31,Vatruvius,And won so the video was removed.
05-04-2018T01:23:44,Bgrmystr2,how did they win
05-04-2018T01:23:52,Bgrmystr2,they have nothing in the video they owned
05-04-2018T01:24:13,NightMeaty22,my brother is talking in his sleep again what do i do
05-04-2018T01:24:21,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, that says more about youtube's lack of proper investigation"
05-04-2018T01:24:22,Vatruvius,Not sure...probably wanted to take it to court and the youtube channel did not have the funds to even go to court so they folded in and dropped the video.
05-04-2018T01:24:26,Bgrmystr2,Guilty until proven innocent
05-04-2018T01:25:01,Vatruvius,That is how it is treated in the UK right...guilty until proven innocent?
05-04-2018T01:25:16,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunate, Vatru, because they would have easily won that case. If the song wasn't in the video whatsoever, then there's no claim to be made by the owners of that song."
05-04-2018T01:26:31,Vatruvius,It was really complicated...I am not sure what it was really about but I know they sued and filed a copyright claim to youtube. Unfortunately youtube does not support their content creators as much as they should when it comes to this legal stuff.
05-04-2018T01:27:02,Bgrmystr2,"youtube bows to any copyright claim, real or fake."
05-04-2018T01:27:22,Bgrmystr2,"and even gives the proceeds to those who make the claim, even if it's illegitimate"
05-04-2018T01:27:45,Vatruvius,That is why the video was removed.
05-04-2018T01:28:12,Vatruvius,And that is why I believe record companies are the scum of the earth...because that is pretty scummy.
05-04-2018T01:28:17,Bgrmystr2,"really doesn't matter at that point, honestly, cuz they already made money off the deal"
05-04-2018T01:28:44,Bgrmystr2,attack something and make money off what you don't own
05-04-2018T01:28:59,Dadrobit,"It's pretty simple stuff, YouTube is considered public performance and distrobution, two elements of copyright law that are protected for the sake of the copyright holder."
05-04-2018T01:29:01,Bgrmystr2,there's no repercussions for false accusations and taking that money
05-04-2018T01:29:39,NightMeaty22,money is the scum of the earth it makes people do scummy things
05-04-2018T01:29:41,Dadrobit,"If you're using other people's stuff on YouTube, and especially if you have ad revenue coming in as part of that, you're in the wrong."
05-04-2018T01:29:59,Vatruvius,I also know they whole thing youtube did with their adds is stupid to. Now most content creators have a hard time of paying their bills and have to set their passion behind to make room for something that will bring in enough money. Bullshit in my opinion
05-04-2018T01:30:31,Dadrobit,"""Oh no, I can't earn money by using other people's stuff anymore!"""
05-04-2018T01:30:42,Dadrobit,"You're a content creator, create content or gtfo."
05-04-2018T01:31:00,Vatruvius,The point I was making above Dadro was that they were making ad revenue on the lack of a record companies music being in the piece.
05-04-2018T01:31:15,Bgrmystr2,Like that makes a difference to record holders which claim copyright on videos that don't have their content in it just to leech money off people
05-04-2018T01:31:25,Bgrmystr2,cuz they're any better :v
05-04-2018T01:31:55,Dadrobit,"Who is ""They"" I don't follow."
05-04-2018T01:31:56,Vatruvius,Also...because the record company really needs that revenue.
05-04-2018T01:33:00,Dadrobit,"Like, unless they paid for a liscense, it's a non-issue."
05-04-2018T01:33:04,Vatruvius,The video I was talking about...this youtube channel uploaded a video of a part of a movie with the music removed...they were trying to make a point. The record company issued a copyright against them and sued because it was their music they removed from
05-04-2018T01:33:05,Vatruvius,the scene.
05-04-2018T01:33:56,Dadrobit,"Ah, I see, yeah, that sucks, except that even use of the vido is unathorized reproduction, so it really was a moot point."
05-04-2018T01:34:23,Vatruvius,Yeah...the movie people did not care. Just the scummy record company.
05-04-2018T01:34:44,Bgrmystr2,"if those who put the copyright strike do not own the video content, but the audio content, then there is no ""unauthorized reproduction"" to begin with"
05-04-2018T01:35:05,Bgrmystr2,because the audio content they're trying to claim copyright for does not exist
05-04-2018T01:35:12,Dadrobit,"Eh, they're just protecting their rights for the most part. If they don't they can have their ownership rihgts revoked."
05-04-2018T01:35:18,Vatruvius,I am not sure if they got authorization to take that part of the film or obeyed the laws...from what I heard it was a common thing for them to do so I assume they new some of the legal stuff around it.
05-04-2018T01:35:49,Dadrobit,"Again, unless they paid for a liscense, it was not legal, no."
05-04-2018T01:36:37,Vatruvius,So...do you have to pay for a license to remove a song from a movie scene?
05-04-2018T01:36:58,Vatruvius,Don't think about the movie...just the song.
05-04-2018T01:37:14,Dadrobit,"No, but you would have to pay a liscense to show the movie scene regardless of audio."
05-04-2018T01:37:31,Bgrmystr2,but the owners of the audio cannot issue that copyright
05-04-2018T01:37:40,Bgrmystr2,the owners of the video have to issue the copyright
05-04-2018T01:37:49,Bgrmystr2,video and audio are not the same
05-04-2018T01:38:21,Dadrobit,Mind pointing me towards the video?
05-04-2018T01:38:28,Bgrmystr2,"but I guess in this instance, those residing over the case didn't realize that :/"
05-04-2018T01:38:38,Vatruvius,That is the point though...the audio owners issued the copyright when they had nothing of theirs in the video to begin with. It is just stupid.
05-04-2018T01:38:48,Bgrmystr2,"also, if the video was removed, how would there be a link to it? lol"
05-04-2018T01:38:51,Dadrobit,"Because if it was from something like Sony, guess what, they probably owned both and were plenty justified."
05-04-2018T01:38:54,Vatruvius,I am for obeying the laws...I think this specific situation is just stupid.
05-04-2018T01:39:20,Dadrobit,Link to a discussion about it?
05-04-2018T01:40:06,NightMeaty22,welp i am going to try to get some sleep
05-04-2018T01:40:11,Dadrobit,Night Meaty
05-04-2018T01:40:11,NightMeaty22,cya
05-04-2018T01:40:19,Bgrmystr2,Wish I had a link to anything about it :/
05-04-2018T01:41:16,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's one instance where it was kind of not copacetic, but still the YouTuber wasn't really in the right either."
05-04-2018T01:41:20,Vatruvius,The discussion was in a video about just random stuff. The particular video in question though posted the ceremony scene in Star Wars without the orchestral music. The record company that owned the rights to that orchestral piece sued and issued a
05-04-2018T01:41:44,Vatruvius,copyright because they claimed their music was essential to that scene.
05-04-2018T01:42:01,Vatruvius,It is a quality source that I trust though.
05-04-2018T01:42:04,Bgrmystr2,"""essential"" does not equal ""being in the content"""
05-04-2018T01:42:08,Bgrmystr2,:/
05-04-2018T01:42:23,Vatruvius,But that was what they claimed...they got what they wanted.
05-04-2018T01:42:50,Bgrmystr2,probably cuz no creator on youtube has the money to pay for a lawyer to go up against a record company
05-04-2018T01:43:22,Vatruvius,Exactly.
05-04-2018T01:43:45,Dadrobit,Seems like a drama queen tbh.
05-04-2018T01:44:12,Vatruvius,Who is a drama queen?
05-04-2018T01:44:25,Dadrobit,"Going out of your way to infringe on one of the most financially sucessful peices of work to ""prove a point""?"
05-04-2018T01:44:42,Dadrobit,He went out of his way to look for trouble.
05-04-2018T01:45:27,Bgrmystr2,I dunno why you'd think creators on youtube are looking for trouble. That's basically suicide to go up against a record label / movie studio or whatnot
05-04-2018T01:45:29,Bgrmystr2,and they know it
05-04-2018T01:45:38,Vatruvius,I do not know what the point was that was trying to be made...something about the affect of orchestral piece in major scenes in popular films and what they are like without them or something.
05-04-2018T01:45:47,Dadrobit,"""Look at me! look at me! Oh no! The looked at me and took away the content I stole! Woe is me...."""
05-04-2018T01:46:18,Dadrobit,You know why it's suicide? Because they're in the wrong 99.999999% of the time.
05-04-2018T01:46:20,Vatruvius,I heard all of this through a Mingles with Jingles video and he knew the people who posted that video and thought the record company was in the wrong.
05-04-2018T01:46:20,Bgrmystr2,I guess the only rights that matter are record holders then? lol
05-04-2018T01:46:42,Dadrobit,Did I say that?
05-04-2018T01:47:10,Bgrmystr2,Did I imply that? :o
05-04-2018T01:47:16,Vatruvius,I did not hear anything from the original creator...I do not think they complained. The viewer base complained.
05-04-2018T01:47:37,Dadrobit,"No, I said that content creators don't know what they're doing when they cry ""fair use"" and wonder why they still get hit with copyright violations."
05-04-2018T01:47:40,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, creators usually can't really talk about legal stuff, vatru"
05-04-2018T01:47:44,Dadrobit,"And yes, you did imply that."
05-04-2018T01:47:50,Bgrmystr2,then maybe yes you did say it.
05-04-2018T01:48:16,Vatruvius,"I never said anything about ""fair use."""
05-04-2018T01:48:18,unsteddyphoenix,Did he say that?
05-04-2018T01:48:29,Dadrobit,Hint: I didn't.
05-04-2018T01:48:33,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, did I imply it?"
05-04-2018T01:48:42,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's a two way street
05-04-2018T01:48:42,unsteddyphoenix,Did he imply that?
05-04-2018T01:48:46,Dadrobit,"No Vat, but that was what everyone was complaingin about."
05-04-2018T01:48:53,Dadrobit,Hint: I did not imply that.
05-04-2018T01:49:03,unsteddyphoenix,These are helpful hints
05-04-2018T01:49:08,Dadrobit,But you most certainly did.
05-04-2018T01:49:21,Bgrmystr2,then I guess you don't read what you write.
05-04-2018T01:49:22,Dadrobit,complaining*
05-04-2018T01:49:23,Bgrmystr2,:/
05-04-2018T01:49:30,Bgrmystr2,Implications are a bitch
05-04-2018T01:49:33,Bgrmystr2,hard to read
05-04-2018T01:49:43,Dadrobit,"Where did I say ""Labels rights are the only ones that matter."""
05-04-2018T01:49:56,Vatruvius,"Okay...I just now from my point a view how can a company that owns rights to some content sue and issue a copyright on content that was missing their content? That just does not seem right. In a situation where they did use their content then fine,"
05-04-2018T01:50:14,Vatruvius,that is illegal. But this particular situation is not that.
05-04-2018T01:50:21,Dadrobit,They can't but the YouTuber STILL was not in the right for even using the video
05-04-2018T01:50:42,Bgrmystr2,"""Look at me! look at me! Oh no! The looked at me and took away the content I stole! Woe is me...."" When a company that only owns the audio of a scene can sue a video that does not contain the audio of that scene, this is not okay."
05-04-2018T01:50:59,Bgrmystr2,"If they owned the video content, then fine"
05-04-2018T01:51:09,Bgrmystr2,but it's not about that
05-04-2018T01:51:23,Dadrobit,"When a regular Joe reproduces or distributes copywritten material, even without monetary gain. That is breaking the law."
05-04-2018T01:51:25,Vatruvius,Again...I have no idea if they had a license for the video...I do not have that information. Ultimately...it is up to these companies to decide if they want to issue a copyright or not. Weather they were in the right or not...
05-04-2018T01:51:39,Vatruvius,...they record company clearly had no say in the matter.
05-04-2018T01:51:45,Vatruvius,But youtube did not care.
05-04-2018T01:52:18,Bgrmystr2,Only the copyright holder of the material can legally issue copyright against content they have ownership in. Anything else is illegitimate.
05-04-2018T01:53:00,Bgrmystr2,but you'd be willing to look the other way when that kind of illegitimate things happen simply because the other content was copyrighted too.
05-04-2018T01:53:06,Bgrmystr2,That's two-facedd.
05-04-2018T01:53:15,Dadrobit,"Like I said, 99.9999999999999% of the time, the YouTuber is in the wrong. There are those oddball one in a million cases where the label goes to far, but even in the case that you've provided, the YouTuber is still practicing infringement."
05-04-2018T01:53:23,Dadrobit,too*
05-04-2018T01:54:24,Bgrmystr2,"If anything, the only thing that would have happened if they did win the case, is that the content owner of the video would have sued for copyright as well"
05-04-2018T01:54:30,Bgrmystr2,and the video would have been taken down anyway
05-04-2018T01:54:46,Vatruvius,I am not trying to say that creating content from copyright material is okay...what I am saying is this particular case is just down right scummy. And I have stated multiple times...I do not know if the youtuber had a license for the video portion or not.
05-04-2018T01:54:52,Dadrobit,"And Vat, no, one does not simply aquire a public performance liscense for Star Wars without a hell of a deep check book and a team of lawyers."
05-04-2018T01:55:19,Vatruvius,I do not know if they illegal posted the movie content. To assume they are without all the information is wrong...I just gave a very specific case.
05-04-2018T01:55:31,Dadrobit,"Seems scummy, but hell, so was the YouTuber."
05-04-2018T01:56:01,Bgrmystr2,hypocrits with money attack hypocrites without money.. taking any bets on who wins that one xD
05-04-2018T01:56:30,Dadrobit,"It's not hypocritical to protect you copyrights, it's your duty."
05-04-2018T01:57:11,Bgrmystr2,"you're right. It is, however, to claim copyright on something that doesn't include your content, then turn around and bitch about people taking it without their permission"
05-04-2018T01:57:27,Dadrobit,"They went too far in this one case, but the only hypocrite was the YouTuber infringing on copyrights to complain about copyrights being too hard to get around."
05-04-2018T01:57:35,Bgrmystr2,because attempting to steal using the law doesn't make it less of theft
05-04-2018T01:57:38,Vatruvius,Let's be honest here Dadro...how many videos are out there on youtube with Star Wars content that could be have a copyright slapped on them? Far too many and Star Wars would not do that because the would ruin their fan base. It just is not profitable.
05-04-2018T01:58:35,Vatruvius,I never said the youtuber complained about copyrights being too hard to get around. Never...just that the MightyJingles thought what the record company did was scummy given the case.
05-04-2018T01:59:17,Dadrobit,"Still doesn't change what it is, and if they wanted to, Disney absolutely would be in the right to protect themselves. It is purely their good will that keeps the videos up."
05-04-2018T02:00:26,Dadrobit,And the YouTuber MJ is protecting is equally as scummy.
05-04-2018T02:00:47,Vatruvius,I understand that...and that is the marketplace. Though Disney is in the right...unless Disney enforces it no harm is being done. It is not like driving under the influence...most reliable content creators understand that when they do this they may very
05-04-2018T02:00:51,Vatruvius,well have to take the video down.
05-04-2018T02:01:21,Vatruvius,You have no idea who the youtuber is Dadro...so how could you say they are scummy?
05-04-2018T02:01:59,Dadrobit,Because this wasn't some kid that used ACDC Back In Black on a CoD video and got caught
05-04-2018T02:02:17,Dadrobit,This was some dude INTENTIONALLY going into this trying to push buttons
05-04-2018T02:03:25,Dadrobit,"To see how far he could go in evading a copyright hit, while still infringing"
05-04-2018T02:03:30,Vatruvius,Again you have no idea what the intent was...the youtuber made a video trying to make a point about movie scenes without their accompanying music. How is that intentionally pushing buttons...it is not.
05-04-2018T02:04:23,Dadrobit,"Eh, debatable. Still infringement tho."
05-04-2018T02:04:27,Vatruvius,It is just making content. Yet you assume he/she is some asshole that did this on purpose to get a bunch of drama.
05-04-2018T02:05:03,Dadrobit,"It's what's called derivative content, protected under copyright law. Not Fair Use."
05-04-2018T02:05:09,Vatruvius,It is infringement...but that is not a criminal offence...just a copyright one that is up to the right's holder.
05-04-2018T02:05:22,Dadrobit,It... It is literally a criminal offense.
05-04-2018T02:06:05,Dadrobit,Why do you think they put those FBI warnings at the beginning or end of all the movies?
05-04-2018T02:06:11,Vatruvius,It is not enforced by police...or FBI or anything. It is up to the right's holder.
05-04-2018T02:06:23,Vatruvius,Also...those warning are for pirating the entire film.
05-04-2018T02:06:40,Dadrobit,ANY reproduction or redistrobution.
05-04-2018T02:06:50,Dadrobit,There is no timetable on infringement.
05-04-2018T02:07:14,Dadrobit,"The ""If you only use 15 seconds it doesn't count"" rule is an absolute myth."
05-04-2018T02:07:22,Vatruvius,If the FBI and police arrests everyone who infringed about every content creator on youtube official or otherwise would be in jail.
05-04-2018T02:07:35,Dadrobit,We could only dream.
05-04-2018T02:07:44,Bgrmystr2,"that's not a dream, that's a nightmare"
05-04-2018T02:08:00,Dadrobit,That was sarcasm
05-04-2018T02:08:06,Vatruvius,Talk about finding a way to kill the internet and enforce a Marshal State.
05-04-2018T02:08:09,Bgrmystr2,"To be fair, I couldn't tell."
05-04-2018T02:08:32,Vatruvius,Neither could I considering you have sided with the record company so far.
05-04-2018T02:08:44,Dadrobit,I have sided with copyright protection. Period.
05-04-2018T02:09:02,Bgrmystr2,even against copyrights that copyright owners don't own
05-04-2018T02:09:09,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
05-04-2018T02:09:22,Vatruvius,But I am not arguing about copyright protection...I am arguing about scummy record companies being scummy and overstepping.
05-04-2018T02:09:43,Dadrobit,"I would argue the same for anyone who's content was stolen and used by a large company, but you have not brought that up, you have only put forth that ""labels are the scum of the earth and here's why"""
05-04-2018T02:10:13,Dadrobit,"I said that they went too far, but I guess reading is kinda hard huh?"
05-04-2018T02:10:51,Vatruvius,I put up that record companies are the scum of the earth because they do shit like this. If it is within their right fine...I don't care...but only record companies stoop to the level.
05-04-2018T02:11:27,Dadrobit,"False, there are plenty of independents who do just the same to others looking for a fast cash grab."
05-04-2018T02:11:52,Bgrmystr2,they're all dicks imo
05-04-2018T02:12:09,Bgrmystr2,Why can't everyone be more like Zun. :/
05-04-2018T02:12:40,Vatruvius,Okay...then there a lot of rights' holders that are scummy. I was just talking about a really stupid case that made me mad at the record company is all. All I know is most rich people are only in it for the money and are complete assholes.
05-04-2018T02:13:08,Vatruvius,They will do anything to get more money...kill a baby...sure...for $10M.
05-04-2018T02:13:34,Dadrobit,Do you know that?
05-04-2018T02:13:46,Dadrobit,I suppose you've met all these super rich baby killers?
05-04-2018T02:14:12,Vatruvius,I know that a fair amount of rich people just like money and do not consider other people as living...just that they are below them.
05-04-2018T02:14:20,Dadrobit,Or maybe you generalize a bit to much?
05-04-2018T02:14:36,Vatruvius,And I was making a point...not sure if they would kill a baby but some might have with a decision they made or something.
05-04-2018T02:15:37,Bgrmystr2,"ahh, my chat broke on the other tab"
05-04-2018T02:15:38,Bgrmystr2,:(
05-04-2018T02:15:40,Vatruvius,"I generally do not like rich people. And when I am talking about ""rich"" people I mean people in the top 1% that have more money then they know what to do with."
05-04-2018T02:15:52,Bgrmystr2,"it says error, trying to reconnect constantly"
05-04-2018T02:15:57,Dadrobit,hyper projecting fallacies is not the way to make a point.
05-04-2018T02:16:14,Vatruvius,And they make decisions just to get more money...manipulate or government just to get more money. That is what annoys me.
05-04-2018T02:16:15,Dadrobit,"Same, had to refresh"
05-04-2018T02:16:28,Vatruvius,our*
05-04-2018T02:16:33,Bgrmystr2,"Also, to make a note.. When one has enough money, vatru, they tend to fall prey to losing sight of the value of money."
05-04-2018T02:16:45,Bgrmystr2,it happens
05-04-2018T02:16:52,Bgrmystr2,too much of a good thing is a bad thing
05-04-2018T02:17:15,Bgrmystr2,"ya get too much of it, it loses what makes it special"
05-04-2018T02:17:19,Vatruvius,Yeah...I just wish people with a lot of money where more charitable and used all their excess money to do good around the world...not try to collect more.
05-04-2018T02:17:51,Vatruvius,What is the point of owning more than one mansion?
05-04-2018T02:18:06,Dadrobit,"One for living, one for parties."
05-04-2018T02:18:10,Bgrmystr2,being able to travel to a different city and being able to live there instead..
05-04-2018T02:18:16,Bgrmystr2,"that'd be what I'd do, myself"
05-04-2018T02:18:23,Bgrmystr2,"having a summer home, I guess"
05-04-2018T02:18:45,Bgrmystr2,"but in my case, it wouldn't be a summer home, cuz I don't care about traveling just because of the season"
05-04-2018T02:18:48,Vatruvius,You could easily just have one and spend all that other money on a school in Africa or feed starving people or building a housing shelter for homeless kids or something beneficial to the community.
05-04-2018T02:19:21,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of the donation things to africa are scams, Vatru"
05-04-2018T02:19:25,Dadrobit,I do kinda miss working security sometimes. I got to interact with a lot of rich baby killers. Most of them were real cordial people. Nice conversations over coffee or tea.
05-04-2018T02:19:28,Bgrmystr2,"some are legit, but not all of em"
05-04-2018T02:19:37,Dadrobit,When they wewn't sacrificing babies for money I guess.
05-04-2018T02:19:44,Dadrobit,weren't*
05-04-2018T02:19:47,Vatruvius,I would not need more than one house...just one. If I got a second then maybe because my parents will live there but I think you get my point.
05-04-2018T02:20:16,Bgrmystr2,"lol dadro, knowing what people's actions are is not as easy as just meeting them over coffee or tea"
05-04-2018T02:20:39,Vatruvius,If you have a successful life you should try to give back to the community...become a role model for others to follow and help others become sucessful.
05-04-2018T02:20:40,Bgrmystr2,I've had close friends who never showed their true colors for years
05-04-2018T02:21:07,Dadrobit,My favorite group of baby killers was this one family that routinely held pajama parties for New Years.
05-04-2018T02:21:16,Bgrmystr2,a shell is very much easy to create lol
05-04-2018T02:21:35,Vatruvius,Also...I think lobbying should be illegal.
05-04-2018T02:21:41,Dadrobit,I remember having to turn away their guests because their attire was too formal.
05-04-2018T02:21:49,Vatruvius,lol
05-04-2018T02:21:50,Dadrobit,One of my favorite turn aways.
05-04-2018T02:22:22,Dadrobit,"Dude was angry, but the wife couldn't stop laughing."
05-04-2018T02:22:26,Bgrmystr2,it was required to be in pajama or you couldn't let them in?
05-04-2018T02:22:37,Dadrobit,Homeowner's rules.
05-04-2018T02:22:52,Bgrmystr2,what if I just wore plainclothes cuz I sleep like that? Would I be turned away too? :P
05-04-2018T02:23:00,Dadrobit,Damned skipp
05-04-2018T02:23:03,Dadrobit,skippy
05-04-2018T02:23:06,Vatruvius,Perhaps strip into your underwear? That counts right?
05-04-2018T02:23:15,Dadrobit,"Also, you wouldn't be on the list."
05-04-2018T02:23:32,Bgrmystr2,"the list is irrelevant, cuz that'd assume I was on the list to begin with"
05-04-2018T02:23:35,Dadrobit,"Eh, it was all about the festive/tacky pajama wear"
05-04-2018T02:24:08,Vatruvius,What if I wore pajamas that looked like a tux?
05-04-2018T02:24:18,Dadrobit,Dressed in a Pikachu onsie? Definitely going in.
05-04-2018T02:24:21,Bgrmystr2,I'm actually more amused that you made the list comment. A snide remark about poor people? :P
05-04-2018T02:24:30,Dadrobit,onesie*
05-04-2018T02:24:32,Bgrmystr2,How classy
05-04-2018T02:24:56,Dadrobit,"Naw, just because it was for friends or family"
05-04-2018T02:24:57,Vatruvius,OMG...yes Bgr. Not on the list...you are too poor.
05-04-2018T02:25:05,Dadrobit,Never said anything about $
05-04-2018T02:25:29,Vatruvius,"That is the stereotype for rich people and their ""lists"" for their parties."
05-04-2018T02:25:31,Dadrobit,"Also, a Tux PJ? I'd probably call them up about that."
05-04-2018T02:25:45,Bgrmystr2,The money or friends/family is irrelevant cuz it was.. fuck what's the word for this
05-04-2018T02:25:54,Bgrmystr2,hypothetical
05-04-2018T02:26:11,Bgrmystr2,"if I wasn't on the list, I wouldn't be going anyway"
05-04-2018T02:26:18,Dadrobit,"Eh, they had their babysitters come over for parties as well."
05-04-2018T02:26:19,Bgrmystr2,so it would never get to the point where I'd be at the door
05-04-2018T02:26:25,Vatruvius,I assume they have a list because people just show up to rich people homes when there is a party right?
05-04-2018T02:26:38,Dadrobit,"Hell, before he unfortunately died, I even went golfing with one of the families."
05-04-2018T02:26:45,Bgrmystr2,so being at the door and invited in or not requires me being on the list
05-04-2018T02:27:02,Dadrobit,And I'm hella far from rich
05-04-2018T02:27:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, gotta be on the list to get into the community. From the grandparents, to the Pizza Hut driver."
05-04-2018T02:27:59,Vatruvius,Not saying you are Dadro...you were just that security card hired by rich people...*scoff* prick guard. :ptv-hearts: I killed you in Payday 2!
05-04-2018T02:28:35,Dadrobit,:( Now I'm sad. I liked that guy.
05-04-2018T02:28:43,Vatruvius,lol
05-04-2018T02:28:59,Dadrobit,"I'm terrible at golf, but he and his family were fun to play with."
05-04-2018T02:29:25,Bgrmystr2,I played golf a few times. Never really cared for it
05-04-2018T02:29:49,Dadrobit,"It wasn't ever about the game really, it was just for enjoying a few drinks and talking about life."
05-04-2018T02:30:47,Vatruvius,"I am not saying all rich people are bad. I just wish those who live really successful lives gave back to the community. If this family did then great...I like them already. I am not saying being successful means you cannot live comfortably, just be a good"
05-04-2018T02:30:50,Vatruvius,role model.
05-04-2018T02:30:51,Dadrobit,"He was a joint owner in a tech company, had just moved down here for a winter home."
05-04-2018T02:31:03,Dadrobit,Had a freak heart attack...
05-04-2018T02:32:22,Dadrobit,I think I'm gonna head off.
05-04-2018T02:32:38,Vatruvius,Goodnight Dadro!
05-04-2018T02:36:58,Vatruvius,I am going to head off too...goodnight everyone! And let's try not to have such serious topics to discuss. :ptv-scratch:
05-04-2018T03:42:22,Twokinds,Poor cat...
05-04-2018T03:43:17,Bgrmystr2,D;
05-04-2018T03:43:23,Bgrmystr2,what happened to the cat?
05-04-2018T03:46:31,Twokinds,"She's whining because I ran out of wet cat food, so all she has is - gasp!- dry!"
05-04-2018T03:46:42,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: noo
05-04-2018T03:46:49,Bgrmystr2,sadcat
05-04-2018T03:47:00,Bgrmystr2,or whatever :thinking:
05-04-2018T03:47:13,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, someone has to react like phoenix when he isn't here to do it himself"
05-04-2018T03:47:21,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure that's what he'd say anyway
05-04-2018T03:48:23,Bgrmystr2,"wish you weren't allergic to your cat, tom. That'd solve at least some of your problems. :/"
05-04-2018T07:17:38,unsteddyphoenix,Holly is suffering and this saddens me
05-04-2018T07:51:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Shame you‚Äôd put her through such hardships
05-04-2018T08:22:54,WIPKING,I might miss a stream of you start at 2 or 3
05-04-2018T08:30:42,Bgrmystr2,Today is Friday. Stream starts at 9pm Eastern.
05-04-2018T08:34:00,WIPKING,Right i dumb theres a scedule
05-04-2018T09:02:33,Njasey,"mh.9pm est, thats in 11hours?"
05-04-2018T09:09:32,Bgrmystr2,"it's EDT right now, so 12 hours"
05-04-2018T09:09:35,Bgrmystr2,erh
05-04-2018T09:09:40,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, 11 hrs"
05-04-2018T09:10:27,Bgrmystr2,Sometimes I forget I'm not Eastern anymore :thinking:
05-04-2018T09:13:39,Njasey,"well, thats 3am for me. damn."
05-04-2018T11:21:10,Vatruvius,Good morning everyone! :ptv-greetings: I hope you are all doing better then me because I woke up with more water problems. :ptv-sad:
05-04-2018T11:35:30,NightMeaty22,good morning
05-04-2018T12:12:23,Vatruvius,I got an idea Tom...considering your cat is upset for the lack of wet food just add water to the dry food. :ptv-snicker:
05-04-2018T12:25:29,Dadrobit,"Oh man, I forgot how good Akira is. Legitimately jaw droppingly good."
05-04-2018T12:27:00,Vatruvius,Hmm...:ptv-wondering:
05-04-2018T12:28:10,Vatruvius,I see what it is...you like it Dadro?
05-04-2018T12:28:18,Vatruvius,Or do I got this all wrong?
05-04-2018T12:29:14,Dadrobit,Just got finished watching it again and was typing that up as the credits were rolling. Hadn't watched it in years.
05-04-2018T12:29:37,Vatruvius,The movie?
05-04-2018T12:29:42,Dadrobit,Yeah
05-04-2018T12:30:32,Vatruvius,I googled it and the first result was some clothing line...then the manga...then the movie.
05-04-2018T12:30:33,Dadrobit,It's actually straight up a masterpiece.
05-04-2018T12:38:55,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I need to get the Bluray sometime
05-04-2018T12:39:02,TorqueEmUp,fantastic movie
05-04-2018T12:40:07,TorqueEmUp,"Oh hell yeah! My Best Buy has the bluray in stock for only $15, and I just happened to have $15 in rewards vouchers."
05-04-2018T12:40:52,Dadrobit,"Yup, nearby Best Buy went out of business a few years back and got it for a steal."
05-04-2018T12:41:26,TorqueEmUp,Well that's a shame it went out of business
05-04-2018T12:41:36,TorqueEmUp,"must just have been a bad location, or poorly managed."
05-04-2018T12:41:41,TorqueEmUp,or both
05-04-2018T12:42:20,TorqueEmUp,Best Buy is my go to for most things
05-04-2018T12:42:23,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was a terrible lease problem from waht I gathered. They were paying out the ass multiple times over compared to larger stores in the area."
05-04-2018T12:42:26,Vatruvius,And I have to go out into the pouring rain because the gutter is clogged...:ptv-unimpressed:
05-04-2018T12:42:28,Dadrobit,what*
05-04-2018T12:42:45,TorqueEmUp,ahh
05-04-2018T12:43:04,Dadrobit,Their lease costs just kept rising until they couldn't pay for it.
05-04-2018T12:45:02,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah this best buy has been around most of my life, while the nearby Circuit City, and Rex (Street there is still named after the store), and there was another with a sun or something in the logo."
05-04-2018T12:45:14,TorqueEmUp,all those stores be gone except for Best Buy
05-04-2018T12:45:31,TorqueEmUp,I miss Circuit City
05-04-2018T12:46:31,TorqueEmUp,And of course Radio Shack is gone too
05-04-2018T12:46:42,Dadrobit,"Oof, Radio Shack."
05-04-2018T12:46:49,TorqueEmUp,Amazon's friggin' killstreak
05-04-2018T12:46:56,TorqueEmUp,just taking down everyone
05-04-2018T12:50:05,TorqueEmUp,Best Buy is like the only player around anymore focused on electronics
05-04-2018T12:50:15,TorqueEmUp,We don't have Fry's around here
05-04-2018T12:51:00,Dadrobit,"Never had a Fry's Electronics nearby, only regular Fry's. The closest FE is like an hour away."
05-04-2018T12:56:43,TorqueEmUp,Closest one to me is over 2 hours away
05-04-2018T12:56:48,TorqueEmUp,in the next state over
05-04-2018T12:57:03,Dadrobit,GG
05-04-2018T12:57:10,TorqueEmUp,Then the next closest one is another state over
05-04-2018T12:57:58,TorqueEmUp,My best buy is just like a 5 min drive away
05-04-2018T12:58:01,TorqueEmUp,:P
05-04-2018T13:02:48,Vatruvius,"I live in a remote part of California so the only stores we have up here is a Kmart and B&C, everything else is a 50 minute commute."
05-04-2018T13:05:18,Dadrobit,"Oh man, first time watching the Extras of the movie, and this dude is composing the soundtrack on a Macintosh Plus. The more things change, the more they stay the same huh."
05-04-2018T13:06:24,Vatruvius,Wait...what?
05-04-2018T13:06:45,Vatruvius,Isn't that film really old though?
05-04-2018T13:06:54,Dadrobit,Late 80's.
05-04-2018T13:07:09,Dadrobit,1988
05-04-2018T13:07:36,Vatruvius,Then it makes sense that is was a Macintosh.
05-04-2018T13:08:13,Dadrobit,"Just saying, Macs are the ""industry standard"" even nowadays for music production."
05-04-2018T13:11:46,Dadrobit,"be back in a bit, gonna get some lunch."
05-04-2018T13:11:46,Vatruvius,"I see what you are saying...I am a PC guy...not into Apple products at all. But I will admit Apple products do approach/handle some things better than PCs...more specifically in the content creation field like drawings, photos, audio, etc."
05-04-2018T13:12:01,Vatruvius,At least that is what people who prefer Apple over PC tell me.
05-04-2018T13:12:41,Vatruvius,"The people that say ""because it is just better"" I ignore because that is just their opinion with no facts to back them up."
05-04-2018T13:12:55,Vatruvius,See ya Dadro.
05-04-2018T13:15:30,Vatruvius,And now it is time to do some homework...*sigh*
05-04-2018T14:25:22,TorqueEmUp,"Thing is, people can't tell me why Macs are better at it."
05-04-2018T14:25:44,TorqueEmUp,No one can give me any solid evidence that they are. :P
05-04-2018T14:29:20,TorqueEmUp,"Maybe at one point they were, but nowadays, I don't think there is any difference between doing something on a Mac and doing it on a PC other than general preferences related to the OS."
05-04-2018T14:42:13,Vatruvius,"I believe at their onception, Macs were designed to do more art oriented work while PCs were designed to do more business stuff. Now PCs pretty much do it all and Apple just up charges you for their name. That is how I see it anyway. I mean...if you like"
05-04-2018T14:42:38,Vatruvius,the Apple OS then good for you...that is a matter of preference.
05-04-2018T14:43:13,Vatruvius,Also...this homework involves watching a video and I have literally fallen asleep like 5 times.
05-04-2018T14:57:02,Vatruvius,My dogs a snoring right now...both of them.
05-04-2018T15:03:58,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
05-04-2018T15:15:31,SpazztasticKiwi,You typing in your sleep?
05-04-2018T15:16:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Watch it in little bits
05-04-2018T15:17:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Might digest more. I‚Äôm taking a walk break before I head back off to another booth
05-04-2018T15:20:34,TorqueEmUp,booth?
05-04-2018T15:21:34,TorqueEmUp,Sounds like you're at a con
05-04-2018T15:21:38,NightMeaty22,my dad just told me to end my life
05-04-2018T15:22:07,TorqueEmUp,That's not cool.....
05-04-2018T15:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Dats not nice
05-04-2018T15:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"And yes, I am"
05-04-2018T15:22:57,NightMeaty22,then he drove off and left me
05-04-2018T15:23:44,TorqueEmUp,"How old are you? if you're young enough, i'd call child services on his ass."
05-04-2018T15:24:27,NightMeaty22,im 14
05-04-2018T15:25:18,NightMeaty22,i'm just at his apartment complex but still
05-04-2018T15:26:24,NightMeaty22,i am supost to be on spring break but he makes me work like i am a slave
05-04-2018T15:26:34,NightMeaty22,to him
05-04-2018T15:27:04,NightMeaty22,and he is pissed because i was hideing in a box
05-04-2018T15:27:31,Tylertt,You're joking right?
05-04-2018T15:27:35,NightMeaty22,no
05-04-2018T15:28:04,NightMeaty22,i wish i was
05-04-2018T15:30:23,NightMeaty22,well i'm gunna go before he gets back he does not like it when i am on my phone
05-04-2018T15:30:46,Tylertt,Don't worry I've been through that kind of stuff before
05-04-2018T15:30:58,NightMeaty22,bye...
05-04-2018T15:31:04,Tylertt,bye...
05-04-2018T15:31:32,TorqueEmUp,Take it easy Night
05-04-2018T15:35:54,Tylertt,I hope they're alright...
05-04-2018T15:37:53,Vatruvius,Well...this took a bitter turn.
05-04-2018T15:38:56,Tylertt,yes... yes it has
05-04-2018T15:39:13,NightMeaty22,i need some people to talk to
05-04-2018T15:39:28,Tylertt,you're back!
05-04-2018T15:39:53,NightMeaty22,if i dont i might shoot myself
05-04-2018T15:40:13,Tylertt,"No, don't think like that"
05-04-2018T15:40:46,Vatruvius,That is not a healthy way to think.
05-04-2018T15:40:49,NightMeaty22,it's hard when your own dad tells you to kill your self
05-04-2018T15:41:04,NightMeaty22,then leaves you
05-04-2018T15:41:48,Tylertt,"first of all, what lead to that happening?"
05-04-2018T15:42:15,NightMeaty22,well he ownes an apartment complex
05-04-2018T15:44:05,NightMeaty22,and has been makeing me work for the past week and i hurt so bad i cant do much and then i hid in a box for 2 min then he exploded
05-04-2018T15:44:17,NightMeaty22,frick...
05-04-2018T15:44:25,NightMeaty22,he's back
05-04-2018T15:44:31,NightMeaty22,well bye
05-04-2018T15:44:37,Tylertt,bye...
05-04-2018T15:50:42,Tylertt,hopes NightMeaty22 is ok...
05-04-2018T15:52:18,Vatruvius,agrees...
05-04-2018T15:55:39,Vatruvius,"I have not seen you here before Tylertt, when did you find Twokinds?"
05-04-2018T15:56:48,Tylertt,A few years ago
05-04-2018T15:57:48,Tylertt,Found this picarto channel a few months ago but I'm in the UK so I can only see the beginning of friday streams
05-04-2018T15:58:49,Tylertt,Sometimes I'm able to watch sunday streams
05-04-2018T16:03:30,Tylertt,I'm also not this talkative in the chat most of the time
05-04-2018T16:07:36,Tylertt,that might be why you haven't seen me here before
05-04-2018T16:08:31,Vatruvius,What does being in the UK have to do with not watching streams in the middle of the week? Is it just too late there?
05-04-2018T16:08:42,Tylertt,yeah
05-04-2018T16:09:06,Tylertt,it's about 11pm or later when friday streams start
05-04-2018T16:11:53,Vatruvius,So you are about 2 hours ahead?
05-04-2018T16:14:47,Tylertt,I think so... may further ahead than that
05-04-2018T16:17:24,Vatruvius,I just did a google search and it looks like you are 5 hours ahead of Tom.
05-04-2018T16:17:55,Tylertt,oh... ok
05-04-2018T16:19:38,Vatruvius,It should be around 10 over there right now...right?
05-04-2018T16:19:45,Tylertt,yep
05-04-2018T16:21:10,Tylertt,so does that mean it's about 5 where you are?
05-04-2018T16:21:58,Vatruvius,It will be around 5 for Tom...I live 3 hours behind him so it is only like 2 where I am.
05-04-2018T16:22:24,Vatruvius,That is actually pretty nice because if Tom's stream run late into the night...which they normally do...it is not that late for me.
05-04-2018T16:24:42,Tylertt,But on my side it runs REALLY late into the night... even then my internet gets knocked off most of the time by midnight
05-04-2018T16:25:15,Vatruvius,Why would your internet shut off at midnight?
05-04-2018T16:27:42,Tylertt,I;m living with my relatives so they decide when it goes off... but if it stays on I might end up staying up for the whole night
05-04-2018T16:29:08,Vatruvius,Right...because the stream for you would start at 2 am and run until 8 am.
05-04-2018T16:31:33,Tylertt,yeah...
05-04-2018T16:41:36,WIPKING,Wow thats late
05-04-2018T16:43:53,Tylertt,I know...
05-04-2018T16:44:17,Bgrmystr2,why would your net turn off ever?
05-04-2018T16:44:28,Bgrmystr2,also hi :ptv-greetings:
05-04-2018T16:44:52,WIPKING,Hi
05-04-2018T16:45:00,Bgrmystr2,"your internet is a service just like TV or phone, it should be on 24/7"
05-04-2018T16:45:25,WIPKING,If its paid
05-04-2018T16:45:43,Bgrmystr2,"that's irrelevant. If it wasn't paid, it'd turn off till you pay the bill"
05-04-2018T16:45:54,Bgrmystr2,that's not the same as turning off in the middle of the night for no reason at all.
05-04-2018T16:46:04,WIPKING,Nvn I don't know what you talking about
05-04-2018T16:46:53,Vatruvius,Tylertt said he is living with relatives so they probably have their wifi turn off at midnight. It is not the service...the relatives.
05-04-2018T16:47:02,Bgrmystr2,"it's ok. I, too, sometimes find reading messages in the chat difficult. :thinking:"
05-04-2018T16:47:14,Bgrmystr2,"why would the wifi turn off though, vatru"
05-04-2018T16:48:11,Tylertt,It can overheat if left on for prolonged periods of time
05-04-2018T16:48:15,Vatruvius,Because some people think the waves emitted by devices effects their sleep and cause cancer so the put the devices on timers to turn off at night when not in use to decrease exposure to these  EMR
05-04-2018T16:48:27,Vatruvius,That is also reasonable.
05-04-2018T16:48:28,Bgrmystr2,"the internet box, Tyler? Rofl, no dude"
05-04-2018T16:48:34,Bgrmystr2,just no
05-04-2018T16:48:51,Tylertt,trust me the last one didn't last long
05-04-2018T16:49:21,Vatruvius,I know my parents put a timer on our router so as to keep myself and my sister from staying up late. That did not last that long.
05-04-2018T16:49:41,Bgrmystr2,"I don't need to trust you, I'm a computer tech. I've had the same modem running for the past 11 years 24/7. it doesn't happen. Modems do not overheat from 24/7 usage."
05-04-2018T16:49:57,Bgrmystr2,They're designed specifically to NOT overheat
05-04-2018T16:50:22,Vatruvius,Not all routers are manufactured the same Bgr...maybe Tyler's is a shitty brand or something. He does not live in the US so we do not really know.
05-04-2018T16:50:23,Bgrmystr2,"and I live on the gulf coast, it cracks 90-100F here in the summer sometimes"
05-04-2018T16:50:40,Bgrmystr2,"shitty brand doesn't mean overheating, vatru"
05-04-2018T16:50:45,Bgrmystr2,that's not how technology works :P
05-04-2018T16:51:20,Vatruvius,No...a shitty brand would not think about heat dissipation and pair all the hot devices together causing something to break.
05-04-2018T16:51:33,Bgrmystr2,that's not true
05-04-2018T16:51:51,Bgrmystr2,"because if they did that, the device would never last more than an hour"
05-04-2018T16:52:10,Vatruvius,I know a fair bit about tech too Bgr...and I understand heat dissipation as well.
05-04-2018T16:52:20,Vatruvius,Just because it is badly designed does not mean it does not sell.
05-04-2018T16:52:40,Bgrmystr2,"they HAVE to think about it, it's not a debatable thing. The fact that there's very little in a modem that heats up is also a factor"
05-04-2018T16:53:05,Tylertt,...What have I started...
05-04-2018T16:53:32,Bgrmystr2,you can't just make up a story about badly designed technical items and then push it off as possible realism xD
05-04-2018T16:53:38,Bgrmystr2,doesn't work that way
05-04-2018T16:53:58,Vatruvius,Modems do not need much to work... that I know. But I am just not ruling out that a stupid manufacturer may not be the problem.
05-04-2018T16:54:22,Vatruvius,I am not pushing anything as real...I am saying it is a possibility Bgr.
05-04-2018T16:54:42,Bgrmystr2,"I'm saying it's not, because they would never survive selling them. Noone would buy them."
05-04-2018T16:54:50,Vatruvius,There are many things that could cause his router to fail weather that be overheating or a short of whatever.
05-04-2018T16:55:03,Bgrmystr2,a short would not be bad design though.
05-04-2018T16:55:09,Bgrmystr2,not like what you said :P
05-04-2018T16:55:10,Vatruvius,Unless that company holds a monopoly and the customers have no choice.
05-04-2018T16:55:27,Tylertt,OK OK CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
05-04-2018T16:55:31,Bgrmystr2,nope
05-04-2018T16:55:35,Tylertt,...
05-04-2018T16:55:35,Bgrmystr2,only technology from now on
05-04-2018T16:55:38,Bgrmystr2,forever
05-04-2018T16:55:44,Bgrmystr2,for the rest of everyone's lives :V
05-04-2018T16:55:47,Vatruvius,I was just listing a possible problem Bgr...I was not saying this is the confirmed only problem.
05-04-2018T16:56:17,Bgrmystr2,making stuff up doesn't make it any more realistic though :P
05-04-2018T16:56:30,Bgrmystr2,"is a nice try, but that's really not how the industry works"
05-04-2018T16:56:41,Vatruvius,How did I make stuff up Bgr?
05-04-2018T16:57:02,Vatruvius,I listed a totally plausible explanation to the problem.
05-04-2018T16:57:18,Bgrmystr2,xD totally plausable eh
05-04-2018T16:58:05,Tylertt,Now can we talk about something else... like what could be on this stream
05-04-2018T16:58:10,Vatruvius,If you know so much Bgr then why don't you solve all the tech problems in the world then? You seem to be so sure that everything I have said in the past two days is 100% wrong and it is really getting old.
05-04-2018T16:59:10,Vatruvius,It will either be a color stream or...more likely...a page stream today.
05-04-2018T16:59:14,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know everything. I do, however, actually know some things. I'm not afraid to say when those things are wrong. It's ok if you call me tactless, I'll accept it lol"
05-04-2018T16:59:21,Bgrmystr2,"probably a page stream, Tyler"
05-04-2018T16:59:58,Tylertt,ok but can you two please stop arguing about my internet box
05-04-2018T17:00:13,Vatruvius,Foolish argument anyway.
05-04-2018T17:00:23,Bgrmystr2,xD 'internet box' oh that amuses me so.
05-04-2018T17:01:10,Bgrmystr2,just makes me try to imagine cramming all of the internet into one box
05-04-2018T17:01:43,Vatruvius,I finding it amusing when I hear my yelling at the heavens when his computer does not do what he wants and I know it is 100% user error.
05-04-2018T17:01:50,Vatruvius,dad*
05-04-2018T17:02:47,Vatruvius,Well...all the internet was at one point inside just one box.
05-04-2018T17:04:33,Tylertt,can you two make up to eachother please
05-04-2018T17:05:18,Vatruvius,No...because we are stubborn men and cannot admit when in the wrong. :ptv-hearts:
05-04-2018T17:06:30,Tylertt,how about if I politely say please again?
05-04-2018T17:07:21,Vatruvius,Maybe...
05-04-2018T17:07:56,Bgrmystr2,"hmm.. well it helps if I were actually wrong, but I guess being in the industry for so long means nothing :v"
05-04-2018T17:08:48,Tylertt,don't start it up again please
05-04-2018T17:09:25,Bgrmystr2,"I was afk getting food, it's just a late response"
05-04-2018T17:09:29,Bgrmystr2,:c
05-04-2018T17:10:10,Tylertt,ok
05-04-2018T17:10:51,Bgrmystr2,"also, the internet wasn't all on one pc xD that's not exactly how it started"
05-04-2018T17:10:59,Tylertt,Oh Tom's here... Just checked who was here
05-04-2018T17:11:05,Bgrmystr2,tom's always here though
05-04-2018T17:12:32,Vatruvius,The internet was a connection of computer communicating with each other. If memory servers me there was a point in history when the internet was in it conception where one computer served as the connection point to all the others.
05-04-2018T17:12:41,Vatruvius,computers*
05-04-2018T17:13:06,Bgrmystr2,that connection point is not the internet though
05-04-2018T17:13:06,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-04-2018T17:13:36,Bgrmystr2,"if you took everything else away, it wouldn't be anything but a computer that can handle more traffic than normal"
05-04-2018T17:13:49,Vatruvius,Yup.
05-04-2018T17:14:39,Bgrmystr2,"anycase, that's not really how it worked back then anyway"
05-04-2018T17:14:40,Bgrmystr2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet
05-04-2018T17:14:46,Vatruvius,It amounts to nothing...but without a connection point there is no internet. It was basically the first server to connect computers together. Or something like that...
05-04-2018T17:15:18,Bgrmystr2,"the internet, in it's infancy form, would be the entire network of computers all added together"
05-04-2018T17:15:27,Bgrmystr2,"if they weren't all connected, the name has no meaning"
05-04-2018T17:15:59,Bgrmystr2,and it wouldn't really gain the name internet until it was much larger anyway
05-04-2018T17:16:10,Bgrmystr2,"hence the name, international network, or internet."
05-04-2018T17:16:44,Bgrmystr2,a lot of people also used interconnected network too
05-04-2018T17:17:18,Tylertt,ok
05-04-2018T17:18:08,Bgrmystr2,"long time ago though, not really a lot of history on terms used and such"
05-04-2018T17:18:41,Vatruvius,"I found what I was referring too...I read it a really long time ago hence I thought it was the ""internet"". It was the NeXT Computer which served as the first web server."
05-04-2018T17:19:17,Bgrmystr2,"ahh that, yeah"
05-04-2018T17:19:19,Tylertt,It is said that the first computer was made by either the greeks or romans to track the stars as well as the planets and the days
05-04-2018T17:19:39,Vatruvius,Depends on your definition of a computer.
05-04-2018T17:21:17,Bgrmystr2,"you're talking about this, Tyler https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism"
05-04-2018T17:21:29,Bgrmystr2,it's an analogue computer
05-04-2018T17:21:46,Tylertt,yep
05-04-2018T17:21:49,Bgrmystr2,analog* says the wiki spelling
05-04-2018T17:21:49,WIPKING,Yay the servers reset so i have new profile pic
05-04-2018T17:21:55,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
05-04-2018T17:24:25,Vatruvius,That is pretty neat...but what I find really interesting is when we started to have our first programmable computers. For instance...the Jacquard Loom that had programmable patterns or Babbage's Analytical Engine.
05-04-2018T17:25:30,Bgrmystr2,"I find it interesting they had physical devices to do the same thing our electronics do today, with even more precision than ours can replicate."
05-04-2018T17:25:40,Vatruvius,Then there was Konrade Zuse's first programmable electric computer...though ENIAC is considered the first in the history books because Zuse was German and this was in world war 2.
05-04-2018T17:26:53,Vatruvius,I am not sure about precision Bgr...I am not familiar with any physical devices but these physical/mechanical devices being what they are are prone to breaking.
05-04-2018T17:28:35,Bgrmystr2,"I believe it was the egyptians that had ""technology"" which would would have told them about the stars, or time, or whatnot more accurately than our computers can calculate"
05-04-2018T17:28:43,Bgrmystr2,"but it's only natural, really"
05-04-2018T17:29:00,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's kinda the same as a digital scale vs a physical one with weights and a lever"
05-04-2018T17:29:19,Bgrmystr2,a physical scale will always be immaculately accurate
05-04-2018T17:29:28,Bgrmystr2,"as long as it's kept up, that is"
05-04-2018T17:30:52,Vatruvius,"Well...that is because the physical ones are analog and are tuned to their location. Digital ones got by steps right...and they do what we program them to do. Unfortunately our current position on time with electronics is...eh, good enough."
05-04-2018T17:31:06,Vatruvius,go*
05-04-2018T17:32:00,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-04-2018T17:33:39,Vatruvius,"Hmm...I discovered a new form of torture. The best way to get information out of someone is to...provide food, water, an empty/lonely room, and a computer that can only play Getting Over It. Either they go insane from isolation or they spill everything"
05-04-2018T17:33:51,Vatruvius,they know just to stop the pain that is Getting Over It.
05-04-2018T17:34:53,Bgrmystr2,"jokes on you, that person probably enjoys the game. :P"
05-04-2018T17:35:50,Vatruvius,They enjoy and break the world record speed run. But even I cannot stand being in a windowless room with just one game and nothing else for weeks. Something is going to break.
05-04-2018T17:36:29,Vatruvius,Also...who do you know actually enjoys anything that is Getting Over It?
05-04-2018T17:37:25,Bgrmystr2,"I don't even know what game it is, but I've met people online that like shit like Qwop"
05-04-2018T17:37:54,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
05-04-2018T17:37:56,Vatruvius,Getting Over It is made by the same person that made QWOP.
05-04-2018T17:38:13,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, okay, so it's basically torture games"
05-04-2018T17:38:15,Bgrmystr2,but
05-04-2018T17:38:18,Bgrmystr2,ppl will like them
05-04-2018T17:38:38,Vatruvius,Just look up Markiplier Getting Over It...non stop rage that is oddly appealing because it is his suffering and not the viewers.
05-04-2018T17:38:49,Bgrmystr2,oooh it's that game
05-04-2018T17:38:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah I can see lots of people enjoying that kind of thing
05-04-2018T17:39:07,Bgrmystr2,the satisfaction of failure if you make one single mistake
05-04-2018T17:39:13,Vatruvius,"Also...if you look up speed run for that game...1 min 30 seconds and Mark suffers for many, many hours."
05-04-2018T17:39:15,Bgrmystr2,but that moment when you don't..
05-04-2018T17:39:16,Bgrmystr2,so good
05-04-2018T17:40:25,Bgrmystr2,the same kinda people who'd do stuff like Getting Over It would probably be the same kind of people who play SHMUPS like Touhou with no continues and no bombs
05-04-2018T17:40:37,Bgrmystr2,"they're insane, the lot of em"
05-04-2018T17:41:19,Vatruvius,Maybe...but this is torture so it would be for like high ranking gang members and terrorists. I do not think they will think the same.
05-04-2018T17:42:07,Vatruvius,Yeah...it won't work when I really think about it. I seemed funny when you did not think about it.
05-04-2018T17:42:24,Vatruvius,So not effective...but it is still fun to watch others suffer playing it.
05-04-2018T17:42:58,Vatruvius,Have you seen those reaction compilations of youtubers/streamers that accidentally grabbed the snake?
05-04-2018T17:44:00,Bgrmystr2,Nope :u
05-04-2018T17:44:21,Vatruvius,Great fun...is it wrong of me to kinda wish that happened to Mark?
05-04-2018T17:44:43,Bgrmystr2,poor mark lol
05-04-2018T17:45:09,Vatruvius,He rages so hard...but he keeps doing it.
05-04-2018T17:52:24,Tylertt,Anyway I think there is an easter egg for if you fall into the water at the start
05-04-2018T17:52:53,Vatruvius,Is there...just give up?
05-04-2018T17:53:03,Vatruvius,"Just say ""no?"""
05-04-2018T17:53:30,Tylertt,no... sadly there isn't
05-04-2018T17:54:10,Vatruvius,"There should be...like a ""Participation Ribbon"" or something."
05-04-2018T17:55:59,Vatruvius,Well I got to go take care of some thing...see you guys at the stream.
05-04-2018T18:13:36,CrRAR,Helllloooo friendos

05-04-2018T18:37:41,Bgrmystr2,"when the polls are up, tom usually has a thing on the screen that says the poll is being taken"
05-04-2018T18:37:46,Bgrmystr2,lol things xD
05-04-2018T18:37:50,ThingsAreMoving,xD
05-04-2018T18:38:23,WIPKING,So he will color a sketch from this last sunday that patrons picked
05-04-2018T18:38:41,ThingsAreMoving,"nah, last sunday didn't happen"
05-04-2018T18:38:45,Bgrmystr2,color streams are at the end of the month
05-04-2018T18:38:50,Bgrmystr2,"and sunday did happen, but it was late"
05-04-2018T18:38:56,Bgrmystr2,and it wasn't very long
05-04-2018T18:39:05,WIPKING,So what will color today
05-04-2018T18:39:15,ThingsAreMoving,nora cards?
05-04-2018T18:39:25,Bgrmystr2,"today is not sunday, it's likely going to be the next comic page"
05-04-2018T18:39:26,WIPKING,No its art on friday
05-04-2018T18:39:32,WIPKING,Or that
05-04-2018T18:39:39,Bgrmystr2,"nora card is considered art, you know"
05-04-2018T18:39:45,WIPKING,Toche
05-04-2018T18:39:49,Bgrmystr2,art means anything tom needs to work on
05-04-2018T18:42:06,ThingsAreMoving,So... how long till the stream?
05-04-2018T18:42:18,ThingsAreMoving,cant be bothered to convert GMT to EST
05-04-2018T18:42:38,Bgrmystr2,an hr 15 mins? :u
05-04-2018T18:42:43,Bgrmystr2,but only cuz you get one freebie
05-04-2018T18:43:07,ThingsAreMoving,"hrm, that was a freebie poorly spent"
05-04-2018T18:43:09,ThingsAreMoving,owell
05-04-2018T18:43:32,Bgrmystr2,"naw, it was a freebie for not needing to convert time zones"
05-04-2018T18:43:38,Bgrmystr2,don't worry :)
05-04-2018T18:43:54,ThingsAreMoving,in that case it was well spent. thanks
05-04-2018T18:44:07,Bgrmystr2,"just remember what time it starts, and you never need to ask again :D"
05-04-2018T18:44:42,ThingsAreMoving,I remember when sunday stream starts
05-04-2018T18:44:59,ThingsAreMoving,"but like I said, can't be bothered to do the math"
05-04-2018T18:45:44,Bgrmystr2,all you gotta do is say
05-04-2018T18:45:47,Bgrmystr2,X time is sunday stream
05-04-2018T18:45:49,Bgrmystr2,add 5 hours
05-04-2018T18:45:52,Bgrmystr2,that's friday stream.
05-04-2018T18:46:09,Bgrmystr2,super easy :v
05-04-2018T18:48:58,ThingsAreMoving,"i know, but after being awake for 17 hours and working for 9, plus writing after drinking 2 liters of beer it's not that simple"
05-04-2018T18:49:25,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: actually it is still simple. it's just you that became unsimple. :P
05-04-2018T18:49:30,WIPKING,Way i ill neber drink
05-04-2018T18:49:37,WIPKING,Why
05-04-2018T18:49:42,ThingsAreMoving,bgr that's deep af
05-04-2018T18:49:46,Bgrmystr2,haha
05-04-2018T18:49:49,WIPKING,As i mess up
05-04-2018T18:50:47,ThingsAreMoving,beer is recreational. vodka is for resets
05-04-2018T18:50:58,ThingsAreMoving,depends on what you want to achieve when drinking
05-04-2018T18:52:21,Vatruvius,And I am back...now I need a shower after moving 8 40 lbs bags of salt and emptying them into my water softener. At least I have ice cream to eat before the shower.
05-04-2018T18:53:23,ThingsAreMoving,"you salty now, lmao"
05-04-2018T18:54:27,Vatruvius,You really should run *sound of pump action shotgun*
05-04-2018T18:55:56,ThingsAreMoving,"sorry, I don't do chat roleplay :ctwokinds-kingtea:"
05-04-2018T18:56:18,Bgrmystr2,classy kingtea as always
05-04-2018T18:56:35,Vatruvius,Yeah...but only Adelaide can do that...not you Things.
05-04-2018T18:57:03,Bgrmystr2,Pretty sure we both just watched things do that very thing you said he can't od.
05-04-2018T18:57:04,Bgrmystr2,do* even

05-04-2018T22:33:05,Vatruvius,Any...why the dark fur? I think it is cool but why...we have never seen a Basitin with dark fur or white hair.
05-04-2018T22:33:09,BluePhantom90,its maybe because Tom hasn't gotten to their hair yet
05-04-2018T22:33:12,Ordithus,"Could be, could be, combak"

05-04-2018T23:04:50,Bgrmystr2,not here tho
05-04-2018T23:04:55,Unenlagia,@Bigboi182 Neither did Steve Trevor.
05-04-2018T23:05:00,Bigboi182,Aiight.

05-04-2018T23:05:59,Bigboi182,"@Dadrobit Oh yeah, she did grow up in the west..."
05-04-2018T23:06:09,Unenlagia,But I must amend the earlier assessment. Keith's mom must have been a spear wielding amazonian badass spy!
05-04-2018T23:06:22,Bigboi182,maybe...
05-04-2018T23:06:42,Vatruvius,I think that could be a sketch which means...not canon.
05-04-2018T23:06:45,Unenlagia,And possibly a defector
05-04-2018T23:07:05,Bigboi182,That previous music could've been used for Raine v Carver...
05-04-2018T23:07:22,BadFoMo,"A little late, but; Keith's mother liked to dress up as one of thoes civilised ones. With there layers of clothes hiding their fur and thoes bindings that forbid their Paws from imbracing the ground."
05-04-2018T23:07:23,Dadrobit,"Okay, Just found my next #QualitySuggestion, Cathleen in her home state's garb. Bonus points if she's able to convince Cornelius to dress up with her."
05-04-2018T23:07:41,Ordithus,Not bad
05-04-2018T23:07:43,Unenlagia,"Too bad Albus got involved, this could have been a pretty cool medieval spy thriller."
05-04-2018T23:07:44,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit I'd vote for it.
05-04-2018T23:07:48,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah why was she wearing normal clothes when cornelius found her
05-04-2018T23:07:54,unsteddyphoenix,And not traditional garb
05-04-2018T23:07:58,Vatruvius,Nice Dadro
05-04-2018T23:08:00,Unenlagia,@Dadrobit I'm down

05-04-2018T23:11:45,Ordithus,"Cathleen as the spy, Cornelius as the ""Bond boy"""

05-04-2018T23:16:17,ZRO4825,Basitinitis. When you made a Basitin lady scream in your ears and now they won't stop ringing.

05-04-2018T23:16:46,WIPKING,Soooo
05-04-2018T23:16:49,MatyMaty,Yeah
05-04-2018T23:16:49,ZRO4825,Proper spelling is a sign of intelligence. Negligence of proper usage of spelling is usually a sign of a lack thereof.
05-04-2018T23:16:50,Unenlagia,"Ringing ears, lewd thoughts, and low blood pressure"

05-04-2018T23:18:43,Unenlagia,I believe there is a process called snu snu. Not an expert on the subject.
05-04-2018T23:18:44,ThingsAreMoving,"lots of stabby stabby I hope, Dad"
05-04-2018T23:18:47,MatyMaty,It seems it was related to his hypertension.

05-04-2018T23:18:58,SageSaga,"no one is going to feel sorry for you WIP so don't try the ""Oh woe is me!"" routine"

05-04-2018T23:22:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That takes talent Maty.
05-04-2018T23:22:45,ZRO4825,"Well, I've met some 26 year olds who are good at acting half their own age, Maty, so you might be on to something there. :thinking:"

05-04-2018T23:23:00,BadFoMo,I think they're an FBI Agant
05-04-2018T23:23:02,Bgrmystr2,cuz it seems legit to me

05-04-2018T23:31:26,Unenlagia,"He's getting up, but it doesn't necessarily portray him standing or kneeling."
05-04-2018T23:31:43,SageSaga,you have been a general pain in the butt all night long
05-04-2018T23:31:47,Combak,That moment when you try to scroll up on a someone's stream to see something. XD

05-04-2018T23:35:49,Bigboi182,Makes sense.
05-04-2018T23:35:51,ThingsAreMoving,Collar of keidranification on the mountain?

05-04-2018T23:36:15,Unenlagia,"@Zero08 Yes, people do this."
05-04-2018T23:36:27,BadFoMo,As I was about to ask; why did these ladies reminded of the Rednecks in Postal 2 when you get the Christmas Tree?

05-04-2018T23:37:18,Zero08,Is Hardees even that good? I never had it cause i never felt like going there :/
05-04-2018T23:37:19,Bigboi182,What about Subway?
05-04-2018T23:37:20,ZRO4825,"But my options are either hardee's, or something that ends up messing with my guts. :("
05-04-2018T23:37:34,Unenlagia,"Ah, that is unfortunate."
05-04-2018T23:37:38,MatyMaty,there is no 24 hours store around?
05-04-2018T23:37:40,ThingsAreMoving,Zro can't you just make some scrambled eggs?
05-04-2018T23:37:41,Zero08,Subway is actually not as healthy as some would like to think xD
05-04-2018T23:37:47,MatyMaty,you can just buy bread and some cheese
05-04-2018T23:37:48,Unenlagia,"No, it's really not"
05-04-2018T23:37:50,ZRO4825,"good god no, no eggs! &gt;_&lt;;"
05-04-2018T23:38:03,MatyMaty,or a salad kit
05-04-2018T23:38:05,Zero08,Why no eggs?
05-04-2018T23:38:06,ThingsAreMoving,"lol, oatmeal then"
05-04-2018T23:38:11,ZRO4825,"No bread, Maty. I cut it out of my diet. :x And I am NOT a fan of salad, lol"

05-04-2018T23:38:25,Zero08,Why not just cereal? It is morning :P
05-04-2018T23:38:28,ZRO4825,Just not. Never have been.
05-04-2018T23:38:38,Bigboi182,"Ok, then i don't know how to hep you."
05-04-2018T23:38:42,Bigboi182,*help
05-04-2018T23:38:44,ZRO4825,Salads are just...they're nothing.
05-04-2018T23:38:46,Bgrmystr2,who even eats cereal in the morning anyway
05-04-2018T23:38:47,MatyMaty,"Zro you are like the 5th american who is like ""eww salad"""
05-04-2018T23:38:53,MatyMaty,that I know
05-04-2018T23:39:04,SageSaga,Salads in most american places arent salads
05-04-2018T23:39:05,ZRO4825,I'm not anti-salad. I just...have no preference TOWARDS it.
05-04-2018T23:39:08,Bgrmystr2,"I know dozens of people like that, Maty xD"
05-04-2018T23:39:08,MatyMaty,I am starting to wonder if it is a common thing over there :P
05-04-2018T23:39:12,Ordithus,Some people just don't want to be helped :ptv-pouty:
05-04-2018T23:39:16,Bgrmystr2,seems common to me
05-04-2018T23:39:16,ThingsAreMoving,every salad is a ceasar salad if you stab it often enough
05-04-2018T23:39:17,ZRO4825,"I do however, love me some chicken. &lt;3"
05-04-2018T23:39:24,Zero08,I can eat a salad but only the lettuce ;w; im super picky and it makes it hard to eat any veggies
05-04-2018T23:39:25,Ordithus,"I like salad, I'm American"
05-04-2018T23:39:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm America and salad is fine
05-04-2018T23:39:28,Bigboi182,@MatyMaty maybe it is...
05-04-2018T23:39:34,Vatruvius,I have met 3 or 4 people that say green stuff is bad and won't have any of it.
05-04-2018T23:39:35,Zero08,Fried or Grilled @Zro?
05-04-2018T23:39:36,Bigboi182,KFC Zro?
05-04-2018T23:39:37,ZRO4825,"Which is why I end up going to Hardee's. Chicken sandwiches, low-carb (on lettuce instead of bread)"
05-04-2018T23:39:41,Dadrobit,"Zro, that's kinda the point of a salad. It's something that you can eat that doesn't actually contain many calories, while still making you feel full."
05-04-2018T23:39:46,MatyMaty,that's so much BS! :P
05-04-2018T23:39:47,ZRO4825,KFC is not open at 12:30am D:
05-04-2018T23:39:52,Dadrobit,:D
05-04-2018T23:39:56,Unenlagia,How about fish? That's easy to cook.
05-04-2018T23:39:59,Unenlagia,Pork too.
05-04-2018T23:40:00,MatyMaty,"fast food chicken has lots of carbs, sodium and other stuffs"
05-04-2018T23:40:04,ThingsAreMoving,^
05-04-2018T23:40:16,Ordithus,Must be why it tastes so good
05-04-2018T23:40:18,Bigboi182,@ZRO4825 Popeye's?
05-04-2018T23:40:18,ZRO4825,:thinking: Really? Seems the same as chicken I've cooked myself.
05-04-2018T23:40:19,TorqueEmUp,in moderation there is nothing wrong with that
05-04-2018T23:40:29,ZRO4825,Don't have a popeye's here.
05-04-2018T23:40:29,MatyMaty,Nope zro
05-04-2018T23:40:36,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"fast food is good because of the mind control drugs they put in it, obviously"
05-04-2018T23:40:40,TrexM,02

05-04-2018T23:40:54,Unenlagia,"No, those are in jet contrails. Didn't you get the pamphlet?"
05-04-2018T23:41:04,HeresyArtStream,Every grocery store around here sells hot rotisserie  chickens.
05-04-2018T23:41:09,Bigboi182,@MatyMaty do you have something against fatty foods? Just askin.
05-04-2018T23:41:15,Zero08,I believe Zro can grill chickenbut they need eggs for fringe it
05-04-2018T23:41:16,ZRO4825,"Either way, ain't going all that way for food."
05-04-2018T23:41:18,Vatruvius,Jet contrails is just condensed water.
05-04-2018T23:41:25,MatyMaty,"for starters it is pre cooked, treated with preservatives"

05-04-2018T23:41:44,TorqueEmUp,"Unless you cook it with absolutely nothing, it's generally going to be the same. Just because it's from a fast food place doesn't automatically make it unhealthy"
05-04-2018T23:41:51,Bigboi182,Seems logical Maty...
05-04-2018T23:41:51,ItsActuallyKopyKat,condensed water with chemicals that turn the friggin frogs gay!
05-04-2018T23:42:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"-Alex Jones, probably"
05-04-2018T23:42:13,Vatruvius,Fast food places do not bye healthy meat...they buy cheap meat. That is a fact.
05-04-2018T23:42:21,MatyMaty,No Torque
05-04-2018T23:42:22,Bigboi182,But some people don't really care about that. They just want something in their stomachs.
05-04-2018T23:42:34,MatyMaty,because you don't need to prserve the chicken for a long time
05-04-2018T23:42:41,MatyMaty,like fast food chains do
05-04-2018T23:42:42,Unenlagia,That was Alex Jones
05-04-2018T23:42:53,Unenlagia,And there was an EDM remix of that rant
05-04-2018T23:42:53,ZRO4825,"I don't really have a choice. I HAVE to get food in my stomach, or the acid starts to tear me a new gut. ^^;"

05-04-2018T23:43:09,Bigboi182,See what i mean Maty?
05-04-2018T23:43:14,Ordithus,Very fast supply chains

05-04-2018T23:44:45,MatyMaty,he's going to turn into a bat and fly out

05-04-2018T23:45:08,Vatruvius,So who is Sage's newest victum?
05-04-2018T23:45:09,ThingsAreMoving,for a while
05-04-2018T23:45:14,ZRO4825,Because I'd rather eat unhealthy food that doesn't make me feel sick once or twice a day than keep food around that may or may not leave me capable of actually doing anything for an hour or 3. :x
05-04-2018T23:45:16,Zero08,he came back but lets all just try to be chill
05-04-2018T23:45:22,Zero08,lets not start getting heated again
05-04-2018T23:45:26,Sammit,most preservatives are a poison designed to prevent bacteria from spoiling the food but what harm them can also harm us.
05-04-2018T23:45:30,Unenlagia,He's not started anything yet.
05-04-2018T23:45:38,TorqueEmUp,I agree with ZRO
05-04-2018T23:45:41,Ordithus,"What on earth do you cook, ZRO?!"
05-04-2018T23:45:45,unsteddyphoenix,Does it jsut reset when you leave and come back?
05-04-2018T23:45:46,BadFoMo,I just had a thought; Are the Basitin Islands like or inspired by the Shivering Islands from Ovlivion?
05-04-2018T23:45:47,MatyMaty,Yeah
05-04-2018T23:45:47,unsteddyphoenix,Good to know

05-04-2018T23:46:13,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, sounds like you need to start by keeping food that doesn't perish in your room zro"
05-04-2018T23:46:21,ZRO4825,"Over the years, Ord? As little as possible. I'm not a great cook. I can make stuff that's edible."
05-04-2018T23:46:26,Zero08,@Zro why no ubereats?
05-04-2018T23:46:31,ZRO4825,Why no what?

05-04-2018T23:46:48,TorqueEmUp,"If uber eats is anything like DoorDash, they shut down at midnight."
05-04-2018T23:46:49,ZRO4825,"OH, that food delivery service thing."
05-04-2018T23:46:50,Unenlagia,I have some pork chops saved for when I get hungry.

05-04-2018T23:47:15,ZRO4825,"Screw that. Why pay someone else to bring me what I can drive myself to get? I drive for a living. I'm a domino's delivery driver, lol."

05-04-2018T23:47:52,MatyMaty,we used to use them for the restaurant
05-04-2018T23:47:58,ZRO4825,"Hey. All it proves is that I'm less lazy than the people who order food from where I work, most of the time. :3"
05-04-2018T23:48:03,MatyMaty,until we hired a permannent delivery guy
05-04-2018T23:48:05,Vatruvius,You make a living doing that Torque?
05-04-2018T23:48:12,Zero08,Nice Maty :3

05-04-2018T23:48:46,Zero08,Wait what type of Restaurant do you work for Maty? I never actually heard :o
