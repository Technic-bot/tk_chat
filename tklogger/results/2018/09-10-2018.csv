09-10-2018T07:39:14,iliar,"Good morning, Tom. How are you? You are early today."
09-10-2018T07:49:52,Twokinds,"Yes, my sleep is still disrupted. I'm tired all the time."
09-10-2018T08:36:04,iliar,It's bad. Although I think for a freelancer it is not as bad as for a regular employee. Boss will not ask why you slept badly at night.
09-10-2018T08:58:47,Twokinds,It's getting better.
09-10-2018T09:38:07,Mippy,Meds don‚Äôt go down well without water but I forgot my drinking  cup. Should I drink out of paint water jar? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
09-10-2018T09:58:00,Twokinds,no
09-10-2018T10:11:01,iliar,Well... Drink a paint is bad idea. But I pretty sure most artist at least once confused the mug with tea/coffee and paint water jar.

09-10-2018T15:50:18,SpazztasticKiwi,:csagesaga-c4:‚ÄùGeography? That‚Äôs the one with the shapes right?‚Äù
09-10-2018T16:43:13,Mippy,:ctwokinds-KatDance: Naw....it‚Äôs the one with all the geos
09-10-2018T16:45:00,Dadrobit,"I mean, it is pretty much based around shapes..."
09-10-2018T16:49:39,Mippy,Waite...geography or geometry?
09-10-2018T17:03:19,Bgrmystr2,Mippy pls

09-10-2018T18:28:47,Ordithus,"It's cold out there, but it's nice and warm inside :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:"
09-10-2018T18:29:08,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy: orrdddd
09-10-2018T18:29:31,Ordithus,Hi bgr
09-10-2018T18:30:15,Bgrmystr2,Hey Ord
09-10-2018T18:32:04,CommanderTrace,Good evening everyone:ptv-greetings:
09-10-2018T18:33:19,Ordithus,yo
09-10-2018T18:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs cold inside
09-10-2018T18:50:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Work likes it‚Äôs ac
09-10-2018T18:54:38,Ordithus,That's just not fair
09-10-2018T19:02:42,Mippy,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2: I have a deadline in nine days...I hope I make it
09-10-2018T19:04:03,Xexanoth,so that gives you 7 days to procrastinate and 1 day to then do it in panic mode.
09-10-2018T19:06:35,Mippy,"Well, I‚Äôve got Two done, one on the go, and two I haven‚Äôt even started."
09-10-2018T19:19:37,Dadrobit,"Finally getting reasonable temperatures out here. Barely hitting 90 at height temps. haven't had the AC on for a week now, just letting the windows open."
09-10-2018T19:20:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
09-10-2018T19:22:57,Ordithus,Should be getting the first snow tonight
09-10-2018T19:24:43,Mippy,"Been there, done that."
09-10-2018T19:26:33,Dadrobit,"I'm torn. On the one hand, snow is such a fun novelty where I live since we only ever barely see it on the mountiantops once every third year or so, so I'd love to see more."
09-10-2018T19:27:05,Dadrobit,"But on the other hand, I'm fully aware that snow is something that gets very old very quickly, and I don't want to have to deal with that kind of circumstance."
09-10-2018T20:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I ever live somewhere that gets lots of snow, I‚Äôm buying a flamethrower for my driveway"
09-10-2018T21:04:42,Bgrmystr2,that sounds awesome
09-10-2018T21:04:44,Bgrmystr2,and a lot of fun
