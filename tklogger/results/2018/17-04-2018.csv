17-04-2018T00:04:20,SpazztasticKiwi,What a way to go
17-04-2018T00:04:48,Twokinds,...
17-04-2018T00:04:51,Twokinds,So hungry
17-04-2018T00:04:52,Dadrobit,Irish Vodka Beans
17-04-2018T00:05:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Still doin' that whole ""diet"" thing huh."
17-04-2018T00:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt you know it‚Äôs a requirement to discuss food porn at least once a day in chat
17-04-2018T00:05:56,Twokinds,Yep
17-04-2018T00:06:19,Dadrobit,Food porn? I'm gonna need a pineapple and a yo-yo real quick in a second.
17-04-2018T00:06:20,unsteddyphoenix,Fighting~
17-04-2018T00:06:39,unsteddyphoenix,Wheres that from...
17-04-2018T00:06:42,unsteddyphoenix,Oh Prequel
17-04-2018T00:06:45,Twokinds,No Katia no
17-04-2018T00:06:48,Dadrobit,Lol
17-04-2018T00:06:59,unsteddyphoenix,Katia yes~ :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:

17-04-2018T00:07:23,unsteddyphoenix,Has that updated any more since the big one lesse~
17-04-2018T00:07:23,Dadrobit,"I actually haven't read Prequel in so long. Just got tired of the constant ""punt the puppy"" theme..."
17-04-2018T00:07:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you doing a regular meals diet or no junk food diet or no eating after 7 pm diet?
17-04-2018T00:07:55,Dadrobit,"I suppose, ""kick the kitten"" would be the more astute idiom."
17-04-2018T00:08:14,Vatruvius,"Never thought fries to be food porn. More like a thick, fat steak oozing juice beside a cup of buttery mashed potatoes with some beautifully grilled vegetables...just asking to be eaten."
17-04-2018T00:08:22,Vatruvius,I would call that food porn in a chat.
17-04-2018T00:08:29,Ordithus,Truly grotesque
17-04-2018T00:08:40,Ordithus,Food erotica is where it's at
17-04-2018T00:08:46,Dadrobit,I dunno if even I could slash fic a potato.
17-04-2018T00:08:49,Twokinds,Just eating less diet.
17-04-2018T00:08:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Vat, contain yourself - there could be children present"
17-04-2018T00:09:02,Twokinds,I'm aiming for around 1200 - 1400 calories.
17-04-2018T00:09:17,unsteddyphoenix,"My friend is pretty big, and he just eats...whole vegetables as meals."
17-04-2018T00:09:19,Vatruvius,lol
17-04-2018T00:09:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Like a huge cucumber, or head of lettuce."
17-04-2018T00:09:38,unsteddyphoenix,Or peppers
17-04-2018T00:09:41,Twokinds,That's... interesting
17-04-2018T00:09:49,unsteddyphoenix,It's bizarre but working.
17-04-2018T00:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever had stuffed bell peppers?
17-04-2018T00:10:05,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs some good stuff
17-04-2018T00:10:08,Ordithus,"Yes, they are amazing."
17-04-2018T00:10:10,unsteddyphoenix,Ive...heard OF them.
17-04-2018T00:10:12,Vatruvius,That is one way to eat vegetables...certainly easier then prepping those vegetables.
17-04-2018T00:10:13,Twokinds,I want it
17-04-2018T00:10:25,Dadrobit,They're pretty amazing.
17-04-2018T00:10:28,Vatruvius,Stuffed bell peppers are really good.
17-04-2018T00:10:29,Twokinds,"I used to not like bell peppers, but my tastes have changed a lot."
17-04-2018T00:10:35,Bgrmystr2,the older gentleman I live with makes them commonly
17-04-2018T00:10:40,Bgrmystr2,Not a fan of the smell
17-04-2018T00:10:42,Twokinds,I like pretty much anything these days.
17-04-2018T00:10:46,Bgrmystr2,"keep that to yourselves, thanks"
17-04-2018T00:10:49,Twokinds,Except mushrooms.
17-04-2018T00:10:57,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-shock:
17-04-2018T00:11:02,Twokinds,"I don't like mushroom. I'll eat it, but I don't care for it."
17-04-2018T00:11:06,unsteddyphoenix,I agree~
17-04-2018T00:11:24,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the texture kills mushrooms for me 95% of the time."
17-04-2018T00:11:28,Ordithus,I love the big ones... what are they called again?  Common in Italian dishes
17-04-2018T00:11:29,unsteddyphoenix,Unpleasent texture
17-04-2018T00:11:30,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
17-04-2018T00:11:44,Twokinds,Ever smell mushroom soaked in water? Fills the whole house.
17-04-2018T00:11:47,Vatruvius,I get nauseous if I have mushrooms with nothing else...not sure why I never used to have that problem but now I do.
17-04-2018T00:11:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Stuffed bell peppers are hollowed peppers stuffed with a rice and pepper mix roasted in the oven
17-04-2018T00:11:50,Dadrobit,And they don't taste so good that I can just overlook it.
17-04-2018T00:11:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Mushrooms in italian are called ""fungi"""
17-04-2018T00:12:00,unsteddyphoenix,Fun fact
17-04-2018T00:12:06,Ordithus,That's because they're so fun
17-04-2018T00:12:21,unsteddyphoenix,Sure!
17-04-2018T00:12:22,Vatruvius,Portabella mushrooms I believe.
17-04-2018T00:12:32,Ordithus,"Ah, that's the one!  thanks Vat"
17-04-2018T00:13:03,Twokinds,If someone offers me mushrooms and tells me they're good they better be magic.
17-04-2018T00:13:12,unsteddyphoenix,Uhhhhhhh
17-04-2018T00:13:16,Ordithus,"One food I hate is raw broccoli.  Cooked is fine, but raw tastes like death."
17-04-2018T00:13:17,Twokinds,hahaha
17-04-2018T00:13:21,Dadrobit,"Haven't had a stuffed bell in a few months, but I made some bell pepper goulash a few days ago, it was darn good if I do say so myself."
17-04-2018T00:14:00,Twokinds,"Eh, I'm find with either. Steamed brocoli and coliflower is good."
17-04-2018T00:14:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ever had saut√©ed mushrooms with grilled vegetables, chicken, and noodles?"
17-04-2018T00:14:10,Dadrobit,":thinking never actually done shrooms tbh. Bucket list, but not something I'm looking into actively."
17-04-2018T00:14:12,unsteddyphoenix,Boiled broccoli is not pleasant
17-04-2018T00:14:16,Dadrobit,:thinking:
17-04-2018T00:14:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you don‚Äôt cook it right, it‚Äôs not"
17-04-2018T00:14:52,unsteddyphoenix,"How do you ""boil it right"""
17-04-2018T00:15:00,Dadrobit,"That dish sounds like it's missing a sauce, Spazz."
17-04-2018T00:15:10,Vatruvius,"Steamed broccoli sauteed with butter, salt, and pepper...mmm,mmm,mmm."
17-04-2018T00:15:27,unsteddyphoenix,Just make a sauce from the fond
17-04-2018T00:15:33,unsteddyphoenix,Presumably
17-04-2018T00:15:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It has a sauce - kinda like an orange sauce
17-04-2018T00:15:57,SpazztasticKiwi,With special seasoning
17-04-2018T00:16:01,Ordithus,I need to learn how to REALLY cook
17-04-2018T00:16:05,Dadrobit,Orange as in color or citrus?
17-04-2018T00:16:30,Vatruvius,I would assume citrus Dadro...
17-04-2018T00:16:31,Twokinds,I really want to make some bulgogi
17-04-2018T00:16:34,Dadrobit,I could see a citrus based sauce working with the veggies and chicken.
17-04-2018T00:16:50,unsteddyphoenix,orange chicken is amazing
17-04-2018T00:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Bulgogi rings a bell
17-04-2018T00:17:03,unsteddyphoenix,KBBQ?
17-04-2018T00:17:06,Twokinds,ya
17-04-2018T00:17:26,unsteddyphoenix,Nice~ I never have it enough.
17-04-2018T00:17:34,unsteddyphoenix,My one korean friends always busy now. :(
17-04-2018T00:17:36,Dadrobit,"a gui made of thin, marinated slices of beef or pork grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin, rib eye or brisket are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish."
17-04-2018T00:17:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never had anything foreign really
17-04-2018T00:17:49,Ordithus,It's good.
17-04-2018T00:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Only had Japanese once years ago
17-04-2018T00:18:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Anything else I‚Äôm pretty sure is imitation
17-04-2018T00:18:34,Vatruvius,I love stir fry foods...Thai is one of my favorite foods to go out to or bring home.
17-04-2018T00:18:36,Ordithus,One of the things that might ever push me to move back to Madison... the food.  So much food.
17-04-2018T00:18:52,Dadrobit,Had Japanese for my 21st birthday. Sake shots all night.
17-04-2018T00:19:36,unsteddyphoenix,Theres this sweet japanese place nearby that cooks the food in front of you
17-04-2018T00:19:47,unsteddyphoenix,"And like, makes little volcanoes out of onions"
17-04-2018T00:20:00,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs like the place I went to
17-04-2018T00:20:06,unsteddyphoenix,And the chefs through food in your mouth if youre up for it
17-04-2018T00:20:10,unsteddyphoenix,*throw
17-04-2018T00:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Owned and operated by a Japanese-American staff

17-04-2018T00:20:22,SpazztasticKiwi,They were nice
17-04-2018T00:20:23,Ordithus,HIbachi grill
17-04-2018T00:20:23,Dadrobit,something...
17-04-2018T00:20:27,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that was it"
17-04-2018T00:20:27,Ordithus,I think
17-04-2018T00:20:34,unsteddyphoenix,s'fun~
17-04-2018T00:21:03,Dadrobit,There's a hibachi nearby with a Mexican chef who's unbelievably hilarious.
17-04-2018T00:21:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Theres heaps of foreign food here. Cant believe someones tried foreign food ""once"""
17-04-2018T00:21:12,Dadrobit,Always tip that guy well
17-04-2018T00:21:13,unsteddyphoenix,Thats really weird to me
17-04-2018T00:22:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt go out much
17-04-2018T00:23:11,unsteddyphoenix,Still~
17-04-2018T00:23:40,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe I should aim for an asian girlfriend for the food :thinking:
17-04-2018T00:23:44,Dadrobit,I suppose that I am very fortunate to have parents and grandparents that like going out.
17-04-2018T00:24:21,Dadrobit,Took grandaddy to a cantina a few weeks back for his 80th. That was a pretty good time.
17-04-2018T00:24:50,Dadrobit,"Also, that's probably why I cook so much Mexican, dated one for several years lol."
17-04-2018T00:24:52,Twokinds,"We should all go out for a barbecue, I'll make you a korean feast."
17-04-2018T00:25:07,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
17-04-2018T00:25:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Sure, next time im in the neighbourhood~"
17-04-2018T00:25:11,Dadrobit,Sounds like a good time.
17-04-2018T00:25:14,Bgrmystr2,that requires going out
17-04-2018T00:25:19,Ordithus,I didn't want to go to work tomorrow anyway
17-04-2018T00:25:30,Dadrobit,Until you pull out the Ketchup of course.
17-04-2018T00:25:36,unsteddyphoenix,I really want a korean feast now that youve said it
17-04-2018T00:25:38,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah
17-04-2018T00:25:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm down
17-04-2018T00:25:46,Ordithus,Noo not ketchup
17-04-2018T00:25:51,Vatruvius,Sounds inviting...I am for it!
17-04-2018T00:25:52,unsteddyphoenix,We need to confirm if Tom is really a crazy person or if its all a ruse
17-04-2018T00:26:00,Bgrmystr2,a bunch of people who don't get out going out? Sounds like contrary to belief
17-04-2018T00:26:03,unsteddyphoenix,Eyes on the ketchup
17-04-2018T00:26:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta make sure this is the Tom we‚Äôre looking for
17-04-2018T00:26:44,Vatruvius,He may be the Tom we are looking for...but is he the Tom that we need!?
17-04-2018T00:26:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be sadly outnumbered though
17-04-2018T00:26:51,Dadrobit,"""Alexa, get me a Korean feast."" -Tom Probably"
17-04-2018T00:26:52,unsteddyphoenix,Lol the prequel sites icon is in fact a pineapple
17-04-2018T00:26:56,SpazztasticKiwi,But I can make some desserts
17-04-2018T00:27:57,Dadrobit,"Ha, so  it is."
17-04-2018T00:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was going to say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the only Tom I need‚Äù, but that sounded off"
17-04-2018T00:28:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Also untrue, the vine guy."
17-04-2018T00:28:20,SpazztasticKiwi,And I know at least one other Tom
17-04-2018T00:28:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Though he goes by ‚ÄúThomas‚Äù
17-04-2018T00:29:02,unsteddyphoenix,I like the vines where he messes with people on the street.
17-04-2018T00:29:03,Dadrobit,Tom is also the name of my more successful older brother.
17-04-2018T00:29:04,unsteddyphoenix,Pretty funny.
17-04-2018T00:29:27,Dadrobit,Ohhh~ The storytime guy?
17-04-2018T00:29:32,unsteddyphoenix,Ye ye
17-04-2018T00:29:38,Dadrobit,Good times.
17-04-2018T00:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs not bad looking either
17-04-2018T00:30:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Photogenic as a model
17-04-2018T00:30:49,unsteddyphoenix,I still like him despite that.
17-04-2018T00:31:11,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs no fair when they‚Äôre talented AND attractive
17-04-2018T00:31:41,unsteddyphoenix,There should be a law
17-04-2018T00:32:51,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs like that with everyone I follow though
17-04-2018T00:33:20,Dadrobit,What's the penalty like for unlawful attraction?
17-04-2018T00:34:00,unsteddyphoenix,DEATH
17-04-2018T00:34:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Or, youre limited on your instagram selfie uploads"
17-04-2018T00:34:21,unsteddyphoenix,For some people its a hard choice
17-04-2018T00:34:23,Dadrobit,So many sexy martyrs.
17-04-2018T00:34:26,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I was thinking of simply making them look unattractive.
17-04-2018T00:34:51,unsteddyphoenix,"But then there would just be new attractive people, just everyone would have a lower standard."
17-04-2018T00:35:12,Bgrmystr2,that's gonna happen regardless lol
17-04-2018T00:35:22,Dadrobit,"""First they came for the 10's. And I did nothing, for I was not a 10."""
17-04-2018T00:35:30,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
17-04-2018T00:35:34,Bgrmystr2,"you're not getting rid of the attractive people that don't have talent, are you? Why would the standards go down?"
17-04-2018T00:35:55,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true
17-04-2018T00:36:00,unsteddyphoenix,They get off with a warning
17-04-2018T00:36:05,Twokinds,"If you get rid of all the 10s, wouldn't the 9s just become 10s?"
17-04-2018T00:36:13,Bgrmystr2,yes tom lol
17-04-2018T00:36:21,Dadrobit,"""Now don't go around practicing any hobbies ya hear?"""
17-04-2018T00:36:50,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúYou have one thing going for you. Keep it that way‚Äù
17-04-2018T00:37:39,Dadrobit,Porn would suffer.
17-04-2018T00:38:01,unsteddyphoenix,I'd watch a show about attractive AND talented people being persecuted.
17-04-2018T00:38:07,unsteddyphoenix,'cause like
17-04-2018T00:38:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Theyre talented, so they could find ways out of the problems"
17-04-2018T00:38:41,unsteddyphoenix,A group of attractive Mcguyvers
17-04-2018T00:38:50,Dadrobit,Only if the talent related to or accentuated mental acuity.
17-04-2018T00:38:59,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôm too sexy to die‚Äù
17-04-2018T00:39:05,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWe beg to differ‚Äù
17-04-2018T00:39:12,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
17-04-2018T00:39:17,unsteddyphoenix,Perfect trailer scene
17-04-2018T00:39:42,unsteddyphoenix,The survivors talents would be
17-04-2018T00:40:05,Dadrobit,The Purge 3: Hollywood Sequester
17-04-2018T00:40:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Though this all depends on what‚Äôs attractive and how far that attractiveness goes
17-04-2018T00:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like, I feel all the people I follow are attractive, but another person may not"
17-04-2018T00:40:57,Dadrobit,The makeup business would die.
17-04-2018T00:41:27,unsteddyphoenix,oof yeah
17-04-2018T00:41:30,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe even outlawed
17-04-2018T00:41:48,SpazztasticKiwi,And do the judges then have to be average in order to be talented judges? Or would that make them unqualified
17-04-2018T00:41:51,Dadrobit,Plastic surgery would be limited to benign tumor removal.
17-04-2018T00:41:52,Vatruvius,I cannot focus on this chat and watch funny videos...too much to juggle. Goodnight everyone! :ptv-greetings: Maybe I will come back when I am not distracted.
17-04-2018T00:42:03,Dadrobit,o/ Vat
17-04-2018T00:42:36,Dadrobit,Film in general would see decline.
17-04-2018T00:42:52,unsteddyphoenix,Ehh idk.
17-04-2018T00:42:55,Dadrobit,Attractive actors would sandbag their performances

17-04-2018T17:39:53,DRAGONTANOPUG,I`ll make it more simple.
17-04-2018T17:41:28,DRAGONTANOPUG,Tom broke physics when he had flora get pregnant. Cause only only living organisms of the same species can mate and have an offspring
17-04-2018T17:42:18,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Human and keidran are not the same species, therefore it is possible for a basitin and kiedran to habe a offspring in the world of twokinds."
17-04-2018T17:42:19,Bgrmystr2,"Dragon, you need to stop trying to apply logic that works in our world. It may not work the same way in theirs."
17-04-2018T17:42:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,Tom directly said no it is not possible
17-04-2018T17:43:07,DRAGONTANOPUG,But logic in the tk world does not say that.
17-04-2018T17:43:24,DRAGONTANOPUG,Only in our world is it not possible.
17-04-2018T17:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre making yourself into a pest
17-04-2018T17:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Stop nitpicking
17-04-2018T17:47:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im am one
17-04-2018T17:49:15,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Sorry just had too get that out of my system, i say its possbile with the world of tk logic. But i guess will will never know for sure."
17-04-2018T17:50:40,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Plus thats kinda what im made to do, nitpicking."
17-04-2018T17:51:36,Bgrmystr2,made to do and choose to do are two different things. You're doing the latter.
17-04-2018T17:54:00,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ok choose too.
17-04-2018T18:06:48,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
17-04-2018T18:06:55,BluePhantom90,hey
17-04-2018T18:06:57,Dadrobit,Finished class for today.
17-04-2018T18:07:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hello
17-04-2018T18:07:43,Dadrobit,"Second critical review day, this time had to get critique from the whole class instead of just the professors."
17-04-2018T18:08:08,Dadrobit,Still got some work to be done.
17-04-2018T18:08:24,Dadrobit,But I've pretty much got the A in the bag.
17-04-2018T18:08:42,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im not doing so good in school
17-04-2018T18:09:42,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ive got Ds in history and wrighting
17-04-2018T18:09:49,Dadrobit,7th grade?
17-04-2018T18:10:01,Dadrobit,Writing*
17-04-2018T18:10:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,Spelling is part of writinh
17-04-2018T18:10:23,DRAGONTANOPUG,Sigh*
17-04-2018T18:10:38,Dadrobit,"Also, is writing a class on penmanship? Or is it just English?"
17-04-2018T18:10:45,DRAGONTANOPUG,English
17-04-2018T18:11:53,Dadrobit,"Whelp, you got another year before those grades really start to count towards your permanent record yo. You got some time left to figure it out, but you need to start figuring it out pretty quick."
17-04-2018T18:12:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,My dads making sure of that.
17-04-2018T18:12:29,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ive been ground from videogames for a year at his house.
17-04-2018T18:13:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but are you actually spending that time improving on your study habits, or are you twiddling your thumbs watching Tom and reading TK?"
17-04-2018T18:13:45,Bgrmystr2,the latter most likely
17-04-2018T18:13:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Take a guess
17-04-2018T18:14:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,In life skills I figured out but I have an hour and a half a free time everyday.
17-04-2018T18:14:21,DRAGONTANOPUG,But but there's something called multitasking
17-04-2018T18:14:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Evidently you‚Äôre not good at it
17-04-2018T18:14:42,DRAGONTANOPUG,U rite
17-04-2018T18:14:48,Dadrobit,Life skills = Home Ec?
17-04-2018T18:15:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Then it‚Äôs not just video games that you need taken away
17-04-2018T18:15:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,You guys did not have life skills when you were in school. It's about drugs and how not to do them and how to grow up and become a better person and complete life goals.
17-04-2018T18:16:27,Bgrmystr2,"yeh you'd know all about what we were taught in school cuz you were there, right?"
17-04-2018T18:16:28,Bgrmystr2,k
17-04-2018T18:16:34,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Kiwi, ive got it ok, im not losing technology for anither god damn year."
17-04-2018T18:16:36,SpazztasticKiwi,You know nothing of how any of us were when we were younger
17-04-2018T18:16:49,Bgrmystr2,tell me more about how you assume shit you don't know :V
17-04-2018T18:17:00,SpazztasticKiwi,^
17-04-2018T18:17:03,Dadrobit,"Bruh, do you even D.A.R.E.?"
17-04-2018T18:17:23,DRAGONTANOPUG,"No Bgr, my teacher is as old as you and she says there was no life skills in your time."
17-04-2018T18:17:30,Dadrobit,Drug awareness was literally 1st grade.
17-04-2018T18:17:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,No its more then just drug awareness
17-04-2018T18:17:54,SpazztasticKiwi,And you believe one person‚Äôs opinion on how an entire chunk of history was?
17-04-2018T18:17:57,Bgrmystr2,One person's experience does not a widespread fact make.
17-04-2018T18:18:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,Fine.
17-04-2018T18:18:33,Bgrmystr2,There was plenty of life skills when we went to school :u
17-04-2018T18:18:53,Bgrmystr2,much the same as there is now
17-04-2018T18:18:58,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ok
17-04-2018T18:20:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,"The point is, im not losing another fucking year of techology at my dads house just because of one 67 percent in math."
17-04-2018T18:20:18,Dadrobit,There are fewer now than there ever were tbh. They don't even offer woodworking in schools in my city anymore.
17-04-2018T18:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,So fail out in school. That‚Äôll show everyone
17-04-2018T18:21:01,DRAGONTANOPUG,Fail!?
17-04-2018T18:21:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,God no
17-04-2018T18:21:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"At the rate and attitude you have now, you‚Äôre headed there"
17-04-2018T18:21:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im about to be nitpicking about thay.
17-04-2018T18:21:53,DRAGONTANOPUG,That
17-04-2018T18:21:55,DRAGONTANOPUG,*
17-04-2018T18:22:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dadrobit, I loved the extracurriculars we had"
17-04-2018T18:22:21,Dadrobit,Skill based classes are being cut out of general population schools and funding is being sent to trade schools that students have to go out of their way to apply and get in to.
17-04-2018T18:22:48,Dadrobit,":( They cut my father's ""Game Design"" class this year."
17-04-2018T18:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Art particularly. But we also had classes on finance and government that I ended up taking
17-04-2018T18:23:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,You guys are older so it means your right?.   I dont know what else to say.
17-04-2018T18:23:35,Dadrobit,And in he has to fight tooth and nail to get basic supplies for his welding class.
17-04-2018T18:23:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I learned balancing check books and stocks and even how to do tax forms. It helped a lot
17-04-2018T18:23:56,Dadrobit,Only has 8 helmets for a class of 34. 2 of the helmets he brought from home.
17-04-2018T18:24:29,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Ok so now i have no clue what you guys are saying, so imma leave for an hour."
17-04-2018T18:24:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I know some technical classes are being removed
17-04-2018T18:25:26,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I hear a lot of folks complain about ""school never taught me about important stuff like taxes,"" but I have to wonder if they simply just didn't take any economics classes."
17-04-2018T18:26:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Exactly. We had one class in particular, the one I took, that taught all that good stuff"
17-04-2018T18:26:06,Bgrmystr2,high school here doesn't actually give you any choices on classes to take
17-04-2018T18:26:28,Bgrmystr2,I've never heard of any that do
17-04-2018T18:26:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"It was an opt-in class, though so no one took it"
17-04-2018T18:26:35,Bgrmystr2,you pick your classes when you get to college lol
17-04-2018T18:27:08,Dadrobit,And I remember learning how to write checks back in 4th grade. We spent 2 months following the stock trades in the newspapers writing checks to buy and sell the stocks that we wanted to invest in.
17-04-2018T18:27:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"They often preferred an ‚Äúeasy class‚Äù, though the teacher made it easy if you let her, and it was fun with her"
17-04-2018T18:27:51,Bgrmystr2,"lol dadro, wish they had that kinda class in my elementary back in GA"
17-04-2018T18:27:51,Twokinds,"At my high school, you had very limited pickings on classes you could take. Usually during Junior and Senior years."
17-04-2018T18:28:05,Dadrobit,We all started with 10k and we competed to see who could make the best gains and suffer the fewest losses.
17-04-2018T18:28:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, if you wanted to get a scholastic diploma, electives were super limited up to Senior year."
17-04-2018T18:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"I had an honor‚Äôs diploma. I was required to take some harder classes, but in the end I was able to choose a bunch of fun optional classes"
17-04-2018T18:29:20,Dadrobit,"But for people who were fine with just graduating, electives could be half your day starting Sophomore."
17-04-2018T18:29:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel web design was my favorite
17-04-2018T18:29:38,Bgrmystr2,"ahh, my high school booted me before I got into 11th, so I never got any options for classes."
17-04-2018T18:29:48,Bgrmystr2,that explains
17-04-2018T18:29:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw. Why?
17-04-2018T18:30:05,Bgrmystr2,moved out of district
17-04-2018T18:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh
17-04-2018T18:30:31,Dadrobit,"It wasn't really a ""class"" in elementary, it was just a section of the day we did like 3 times a week. Everyone huddled into the library and we all rifled through the newspapers."
17-04-2018T18:30:58,Bgrmystr2,"parents had separated a year or two prior, and both of them moved out of district.. and the school in the area wasn't accepting anyone new"
17-04-2018T18:31:03,Bgrmystr2,so I had nowhere to go
17-04-2018T18:31:13,Bgrmystr2,:U
17-04-2018T18:31:22,SpazztasticKiwi,üò∂
17-04-2018T18:31:39,Dadrobit,"I remember on Fridays, this dude from Bank One would come in and help out giving advice on how to invest."
17-04-2018T18:31:55,Dadrobit,"Dang, bad luck man."
17-04-2018T18:32:00,Bgrmystr2,dunno how that even happens in 4th grade dadro
17-04-2018T18:32:09,Bgrmystr2,"like, how does someone so young even understand stock shit"
17-04-2018T18:32:13,Bgrmystr2,most adults can't even do that shit
17-04-2018T18:32:16,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-04-2018T18:32:23,Dadrobit,It was just a fun activity?
17-04-2018T18:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Maybe not understand it completely, but at least just serve to introduce them to it?"
17-04-2018T18:33:14,Dadrobit,"Keep track in your notebook of how many stocks you had of each, then check the prices and decide how much to sell of what."
17-04-2018T18:33:23,Bgrmystr2,"the only thing I learned about stocks is that there's a bunch of em for lots of companies and stuff, they go up and down, and ppl buy/sell etc"
17-04-2018T18:33:33,Dadrobit,While keeping a tally of your liquid $.
17-04-2018T18:33:34,Bgrmystr2,super simple vague stuff
17-04-2018T18:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember thinking how insane those financial and web design classes were. But I‚Äôm very happy I took them
17-04-2018T18:34:08,Dadrobit,"It's not like we all were making intelligent investments, we were just throwing darts at a wall basically lol."
17-04-2018T18:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I know better of what I‚Äôm doing
17-04-2018T18:34:31,Dadrobit,"I remember I lost money, but only by a bit."
17-04-2018T18:34:31,Bgrmystr2,"the computer class I took in elementary was trash. Most the computers didn't work, the keyboards were garbage, and you didn't do ANYTHING that even remotely taught you about computers at all"
17-04-2018T18:34:35,Bgrmystr2,:/
17-04-2018T18:34:44,Bgrmystr2,"might have been middle, dunno"
17-04-2018T18:34:56,Bgrmystr2,all my years pre-2002 kinda melded together..
17-04-2018T18:35:31,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch everything 8th grade and before I don't recall too well
17-04-2018T18:35:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"We kinda did a similar game in our financial class. It was legitimately to understand what we were doing and what was going on, but in a semi entertaining way"
17-04-2018T18:35:46,qwe304,i have a basic understanding of C and java from my CS class
17-04-2018T18:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm still lost in photoshop sometimes
17-04-2018T18:36:51,SpazztasticKiwi,But the web design program I used I was good with
17-04-2018T18:37:03,Dadrobit,:/ My dad's Game Design class got killed off because a city admin came in decided that it wasn't really a coding class even though it gave a credit towards that.
17-04-2018T18:37:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Had a copy of it on a flash drive, but I don‚Äôt know where it went"
17-04-2018T18:37:26,Bgrmystr2,"did people make code? If so, it's a coding class."
17-04-2018T18:37:33,Bgrmystr2,Game design is still coding.
17-04-2018T18:37:42,Dadrobit,"Because the program they used called their ""proprietary"" code something other than C, even though it was just C."
17-04-2018T18:38:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve been able to try my hand at coding
17-04-2018T18:38:07,Dadrobit,So they shut it down.
17-04-2018T18:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs just stupid
17-04-2018T18:39:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the first semester is just manipulation of the built in assets, but by the end of that semester and the whole second semester it was just coding."
17-04-2018T18:39:07,Bgrmystr2,sounds like the city admin has no idea how coding works
17-04-2018T18:39:43,Dadrobit,They were actively trying to take away funding from general population schools so they could funnel it to another.
17-04-2018T18:39:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"With the way life‚Äôs going, coding and technological stuff is becoming more used and rather essential"
17-04-2018T18:40:03,Dadrobit,"A school here called ""EVIT"""
17-04-2018T18:40:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Replace that t with an l
17-04-2018T18:40:32,Dadrobit,They by themselves have over 1/3 of all city funding for tech classes.
17-04-2018T18:40:33,SpazztasticKiwi,*‚ÄúL‚Äù
17-04-2018T18:41:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Why does uppercase I (i) and lowercase l (L) look exactly alike?
17-04-2018T18:41:29,Bgrmystr2,only thing they're doing over there is trying to make money
17-04-2018T18:41:45,Bgrmystr2,they're not exactly alike in every font
17-04-2018T18:42:00,Bgrmystr2,not even in the font Picarto uses
17-04-2018T18:42:07,Dadrobit,"Because they sent someone out to all the public schools and ambushed the teachers in tech classes trying to catch them being less than ""adequate"" for actually teaching the class.."
17-04-2018T18:42:25,Bgrmystr2,the lowercase L has an extention at the bottom right
17-04-2018T18:42:59,Dadrobit,"So the EVIT proctor then went to the city and said ""why are you funding ~those~ unqualified teachers when you could be funding US instead?"""
17-04-2018T18:43:23,Bgrmystr2,"literally trash is what they are, dadro"
17-04-2018T18:43:35,Dadrobit,They killed a lot of programs.
17-04-2018T18:43:50,DRAGONTANOPUG,I did take family consumer science [or homec]  and got a A but still i making croissants and the oven is making wierd steam nosies is that good?
17-04-2018T18:44:44,Dadrobit,"And even if a student applies to EVIT, there's a good chance they can't get in, so the student just can't learn the skill at all anymore if their own school had their funding for that class cut ~because~ of EVIT."
17-04-2018T18:45:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,Now its grumbling help!!
17-04-2018T18:45:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,Thats it turing it off
17-04-2018T18:46:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"I hate what they‚Äôve been doing to some schools. Like your situation, some people seem to think that the old way is still applicable"
17-04-2018T18:46:49,Dadrobit,"Because even with having 1/3 of all city funding, they sure as hell can't actually contain 1/3 of all students."
17-04-2018T18:48:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,Theres good news and theres bad news
17-04-2018T18:48:11,SpazztasticKiwi,We need more life skill classes
17-04-2018T18:48:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,Good the house isnt on fire. Bad news croissants are burnt
17-04-2018T18:48:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I heard at one point that one state was discussing implimenting life skill classes as a graduation requirement
17-04-2018T18:49:00,Dadrobit,"My father teaches some of the highest performing students in the state and even the country, but he can't even get damned helmets for his students anymore."
17-04-2018T18:49:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Welding is unfortunately still looked at as a lower job to some
17-04-2018T18:49:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Something you learn on the job or from family because you can do ‚Äúreal‚Äù school
17-04-2018T18:50:43,Dadrobit,"Which is dumb, his kids graduate with real word certificates earning $45+ an hour in a $10 min wage state."
17-04-2018T18:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,The things I‚Äôve seen made from welding though can and is pretty much art
17-04-2018T18:51:04,Dadrobit,world*
17-04-2018T18:51:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially some that do side projects. Have you seen the horse sculpture some guy made out of welding scrap metal together?
17-04-2018T18:52:26,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he actually used to weld for an artist on the side. He just made tall metal boxes for the dude at $1500 a pop. The guy glued river stones to them and sold them at 10x that."
17-04-2018T18:53:21,Dadrobit,"Oh, we actually have a metal art shop with stuff like life sized scrap metal horses down the road."
17-04-2018T18:53:45,Dadrobit,Lemme see if I can't find pictures of something my pops has done for himself.
17-04-2018T18:58:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be doing some spring cleaning. Take your time
17-04-2018T19:02:18,Dadrobit,"Found one of a giant scorpion he did a while back, but imgur is taking forever to upload."
17-04-2018T19:04:43,Dadrobit,"Well, here's another ""project"" that I at least have at the ready."
17-04-2018T19:04:45,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/1smgifZ.jpg
17-04-2018T19:05:32,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about
17-04-2018T19:06:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Just because someone just sees what a job‚Äôs baseline is doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no more to it
17-04-2018T19:06:16,unsteddyphoenix,we mad max bois
17-04-2018T19:06:22,Dadrobit,Yuuuup
17-04-2018T19:06:25,Bgrmystr2,I remember that img dadro
17-04-2018T19:06:51,Dadrobit,"He made a ""tribe"" that goes to Mad Max events like Wasteland Weekend with that vehicle."

17-04-2018T20:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"You wouldn‚Äôt know me if we were in the same elevator, but I have the heart of a sweet girl"
17-04-2018T20:15:24,SpazztasticKiwi,In a jar
17-04-2018T20:15:28,SpazztasticKiwi,On my desk
17-04-2018T20:17:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm just a little odd
17-04-2018T20:22:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im odd too?
17-04-2018T20:22:09,CrRAR,"like, an apple a day unsteddy?"
17-04-2018T20:22:14,CrRAR,that's respectable
17-04-2018T20:23:04,unsteddyphoenix,Good source of...various vitamins...
17-04-2018T20:23:12,unsteddyphoenix,Also doctors are allergic to them
17-04-2018T20:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,An apple a day will keep anyone away if you throw it hard enough
17-04-2018T20:26:47,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-dealwithit:
17-04-2018T20:31:21,CrRAR,"Haha, doctors and apples, vampires and garlic... I think we're discovering a pattern here."
17-04-2018T20:31:42,Bgrmystr2,wonder what my weakness is.. :thinking:
17-04-2018T20:32:54,Dadrobit,I know exactly what my weakness is.
17-04-2018T20:33:03,Dadrobit,Androgynous Optomitrists.
17-04-2018T20:33:13,unsteddyphoenix,Well la-dee-da look at these guys with SINGLE weaknesses
17-04-2018T20:33:44,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Holy crap 97 to 99 and we won with my clutch, they were all standing on a row."
17-04-2018T20:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn‚Äôt the stereotype that men are afraid of nothing?
17-04-2018T20:43:11,Bgrmystr2,a real man doesn't afraid of anything.
17-04-2018T20:43:14,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:c
17-04-2018T20:43:17,unsteddyphoenix,^
17-04-2018T20:44:09,Dadrobit,Just because I have a weakness does not mean I am afraid of it.
17-04-2018T20:44:48,Dadrobit,Fear is the mind killer
17-04-2018T20:45:05,Dadrobit,Fear is the little death that brings total annhilation.
17-04-2018T20:45:21,Dadrobit,I will face the optomotrist
17-04-2018T20:45:28,Dadrobit,I will permit it to pass over me and through me
17-04-2018T20:45:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im not affrait
17-04-2018T20:45:35,unsteddyphoenix,hahaha
17-04-2018T20:45:40,Dadrobit,And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path
17-04-2018T20:45:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,I'm not afraid to die
17-04-2018T20:45:58,DRAGONTANOPUG,We were meamt to die.
17-04-2018T20:46:05,Dadrobit,"Where the optomotrist has gone, there will be nothing."
17-04-2018T20:46:15,Dadrobit,Only I will remain.
17-04-2018T20:46:20,unsteddyphoenix,"""inner eye"" too"
17-04-2018T20:46:24,unsteddyphoenix,Bonus points

17-04-2018T20:46:56,Dadrobit,"One of my first ""adult"" books my dad made me read."
17-04-2018T20:47:08,unsteddyphoenix,Someday i'll read a book again...someday...

17-04-2018T20:47:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,No like clock
17-04-2018T20:54:17,Dadrobit,"Oof, there's dust on my copy. Clearly it is a sign that it needs to be re-read."
17-04-2018T20:57:45,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im raging so hard right now
17-04-2018T20:58:00,DRAGONTANOPUG,I want to destroy everything in my room

17-04-2018T21:20:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,You could just say no
17-04-2018T21:21:06,Bgrmystr2,"nah, cuz that's false."
17-04-2018T21:21:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,Well if you said no then i wouldnt keep asking
17-04-2018T21:23:12,Bgrmystr2,I'm not going to give you anything free even if you did keep asking.

17-04-2018T21:24:12,Bgrmystr2,nah you wouldn't. People tell you no all the time and you don't stop. You've been banned twice minimum because of it. From two different peopl.
17-04-2018T21:24:18,Bgrmystr2,people* even
17-04-2018T21:24:42,Bgrmystr2,Figure it's easier this way.
17-04-2018T21:24:43,DRAGONTANOPUG,Fine you win.
17-04-2018T21:27:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,No one cares anyway.
17-04-2018T21:36:47,Vatruvius,Put a home made combination pizza in the oven...looking forward to eating it.
17-04-2018T21:38:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Pizza üçï

17-04-2018T21:42:00,DRAGONTANOPUG,eats Vaturvius'ss pizza.
17-04-2018T21:42:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I sneezed and Bagheera acted like I insulted his ancestors

17-04-2018T21:46:46,Vatruvius,Your mouth would be burning Dragon...my pizza is still in the oven.
17-04-2018T21:47:10,Vatruvius,"Also...no, you did not eat my pizza."
17-04-2018T21:47:34,DRAGONTANOPUG,God im done theres a templar named trace XD
17-04-2018T21:50:24,unsteddyphoenix,no there isnt
17-04-2018T21:51:39,Vatruvius,Googled it since I do not play Assassin's Creed...there is no Templar named Trace.
17-04-2018T21:51:49,Dadrobit,Back.
17-04-2018T21:52:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,Not main charcter theres one in the background named trace
17-04-2018T21:52:37,Dadrobit,Speaking of. Got a buddy in class who's doing audio replacement for the AC: Unity trailer.
17-04-2018T21:52:48,Dadrobit,It's.... passable.
17-04-2018T21:53:39,unsteddyphoenix,:thumbsup:
17-04-2018T21:54:05,Dadrobit,His footsteps kinda sucked.
17-04-2018T21:54:54,unsteddyphoenix,:thumbsdown:
17-04-2018T21:56:57,Dadrobit,"Whoa, power surge."
17-04-2018T21:57:16,Dadrobit,PC died and it's updating on the reboot...
17-04-2018T21:59:00,Dadrobit,"But yeah, he used all of two samples for the footsteps so it's just ""clip-clop"" the whole way through."
17-04-2018T22:00:05,Vatruvius,Lazy or procrastinated?
17-04-2018T22:00:10,Dadrobit,It was just oddly distracting.
17-04-2018T22:01:07,Dadrobit,"Dunno, he seems to work pretty diligently in class and even spends plenty of time after class working."
17-04-2018T22:02:40,Dadrobit,"There were a couple cool moments in there as well, but footsteps are kind of a big deal to screw up badly."
17-04-2018T22:04:29,Dadrobit,"And to be fair, the original trailer audio was kinda meh anyways lol."
17-04-2018T22:05:35,CrRAR,end of semester crunch-time is a hellava drug
17-04-2018T22:06:23,Dadrobit,He's in a helluva crunch right about now.
17-04-2018T22:07:50,Dadrobit,"He's actually moving out of state to go to a dedicated audio production school after the semester ends, so he can't be messing up on crap like footsteps."
17-04-2018T22:09:02,CrRAR,"aw yeah, bad time to get sloppy. Hopefully has other decent pieces for the portfolio?"
17-04-2018T22:11:35,Dadrobit,Computer is alive! \o/
17-04-2018T22:11:55,Dadrobit,"And yeah, he has some okay stuff that he's done in the past."
17-04-2018T22:12:16,Dadrobit,Did good work on a Pixar(?) short film.
17-04-2018T22:12:32,CrRAR,"oh, nice"
17-04-2018T22:13:00,Dadrobit,"It was the one where an alien was going through an ""alien abduction certification exam"" and kept screwing it up."
17-04-2018T22:14:09,Dadrobit,Lifted - Pixar
17-04-2018T22:20:00,CrRAR,lol that poor tractor-beam test subject.
17-04-2018T22:21:00,CrRAR,Looked a little like the Ratatouille cook guy... I wonder if they used the same model.
17-04-2018T22:22:45,CrRAR,Also the farm house was eerily reminiscent of the Courage the Cowardly Dog farm.
17-04-2018T22:23:28,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im board!!!!!!!
17-04-2018T22:23:56,MidnightBlue78,Hi board!
17-04-2018T22:24:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hello
17-04-2018T22:24:19,MidnightBlue78,"And it's spelled bored, not board"
17-04-2018T22:24:29,MidnightBlue78,"Sorry, i had to"
17-04-2018T22:24:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,I figured that out when I tried to spell it when I use the microphone
17-04-2018T22:24:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,But it was too late
17-04-2018T22:24:53,MidnightBlue78,dang it
17-04-2018T22:25:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,Has been especially annoying today
17-04-2018T22:25:49,MidnightBlue78,"Well, unfortunately i have to say bye, it's late for me"
17-04-2018T22:25:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im still contemplating about how basitin and keidran can have a baby
17-04-2018T22:25:58,DRAGONTANOPUG,I guess hye
17-04-2018T22:25:58,MidnightBlue78,Good night :ptv-sleepy:
17-04-2018T22:26:00,DRAGONTANOPUG,Bye
17-04-2018T22:26:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,Gn
17-04-2018T22:26:45,DRAGONTANOPUG,Well toms gone good night guys.
17-04-2018T22:27:37,Vatruvius,Tom said that Basitin and Keidran cannot have a baby Dragon...I know you were there for that.
17-04-2018T22:28:53,DRAGONTANOPUG,But logic in the tk world does not support his claim
17-04-2018T22:29:09,Bgrmystr2,"He also said he was joking, Vatru. But did not say what that was pointed towards."
17-04-2018T22:29:33,Bgrmystr2,It was a Tom-ism.
17-04-2018T22:29:42,Bgrmystr2,if you could call it that.
17-04-2018T22:30:42,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Vat, he had flora become pregnant by trace who isnt the same species as her."
17-04-2018T22:31:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,Only the same species can mate and have an offspring.
17-04-2018T22:31:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,left the chat
17-04-2018T22:31:49,Bgrmystr2,here's someone making a lot of assumptions without even bothering to comprehend what happened in the comic story
17-04-2018T22:32:02,Bgrmystr2,critical flaw.
17-04-2018T22:32:44,Vatruvius,Not true...Tom said Basitin and Humans can mate and produce offspring...but no other species can mate and produce offspring with a Keidran. The only reason Trace and Flora have a child is because Neutral allowed Humans and Keidran to have offspring after
17-04-2018T22:32:46,Vatruvius,her failed plan.
17-04-2018T22:33:16,Bgrmystr2,I don't.. think that's how it  went xD
17-04-2018T22:33:17,Vatruvius,Her...him...it?
17-04-2018T22:33:23,Bgrmystr2,"it, probably"
17-04-2018T22:33:30,Bgrmystr2,the masks don't have a gender.
17-04-2018T22:33:35,Vatruvius,What do you mean how it went?
17-04-2018T22:34:49,Bgrmystr2,"From what I got, tom said that basitin and keidran having kids was ""impossible"" which I think was Tom-ism sarcasm as usual, especially when he went onto say he was joking"
17-04-2018T22:35:06,Bgrmystr2,"but it's likely that even if they can, it would probably be complicated"
17-04-2018T22:35:23,DRAGONTANOPUG,Thanks for making me drop it.
17-04-2018T22:35:53,DRAGONTANOPUG,No one told me it was a joke untill 5 mins ago.
17-04-2018T22:36:16,Bgrmystr2,Tom literally said so right afterwards.
17-04-2018T22:36:27,Bgrmystr2,just because you didn't read it doesn't mean it didn't happen.
17-04-2018T22:36:32,DRAGONTANOPUG,left before tom said a thing.
17-04-2018T22:36:33,Vatruvius,Hmm...I did not catch him saying he was joking however we can agree that Neutral allowed the race that comes from Human and Keidran mating after it's plan failed.
17-04-2018T22:36:57,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, vatru Neutral is the reason Trace & Flora can have a child"
17-04-2018T22:37:24,Bgrmystr2,but what I don't know is why it was something Neutral originally thought would help them in the first place
17-04-2018T22:38:45,Bgrmystr2,Why is it that Humans x Keidran was such a bad thing that it wasn't somethin Neutral allowed?
17-04-2018T22:38:57,Vatruvius,"I believe Neutral allowed it because it said something about having some part of it's race, I assume the Keidran, live on. I guess it expects all Keidran to be wiped out with the failure of it's plan."
17-04-2018T22:38:59,Bgrmystr2,What exactly did Neutral have to gain? Or lose?
17-04-2018T22:39:11,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, but that's not the question"
17-04-2018T22:39:24,Bgrmystr2,the question is why was the Human+Keidran disallowed to begin with
17-04-2018T22:40:03,DRAGONTANOPUG,I looked it up its possible.
17-04-2018T22:40:10,Vatruvius,That is a very interesting question...one I assume will become a important to the story later on if it is to tie together.
17-04-2018T22:40:17,Bgrmystr2,"Probably, vatru"
17-04-2018T22:40:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,Night üôÉ
17-04-2018T22:40:48,Vatruvius,Good night!
17-04-2018T22:41:32,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna go look for somethin to eat :u
17-04-2018T22:46:30,Dadrobit,Fuck.
17-04-2018T22:46:37,Dadrobit,Just got a call from my parents.
17-04-2018T22:46:59,Dadrobit,Grandma broke her back trying to jump over a stream.
17-04-2018T22:47:50,Dadrobit,"Doctors said she should be fine, that it was just a hairline compression fracture in her L3. But still."
17-04-2018T22:48:12,BadFoMo,Dang!
17-04-2018T22:48:42,Dadrobit,"She's all doped up and asleep in the hospital at the moment, so I sent her a text."
17-04-2018T22:49:05,Dadrobit,Gonna call grandaddy and see when I can't go give her a visit.
17-04-2018T22:52:58,TheBeckoner,"I hope she does well Robit, she seems to be pretty cool from what you say."
17-04-2018T22:53:34,TheBeckoner,I just got back from the closing shift at my store...so tired. Im not used to retail jobs...
17-04-2018T22:53:42,TheBeckoner,How are y'all?
17-04-2018T22:54:59,Dadrobit,"halfway devasated at the moment. My grandma's so goddamned important to me, it scares the hell outta me to hear this happened."
17-04-2018T22:55:16,Dadrobit,But thank you for the well wishes.
17-04-2018T22:56:07,Dadrobit,I think I'm going to take a break from the internet for a bit if I can.
17-04-2018T23:05:26,Bgrmystr2,"Aw dadrobit, give her my regards. I hope she gets better soon"
17-04-2018T23:05:45,Bgrmystr2,and give her a metaphorical bop on the head from me for tryin to jump over a stream anyway
17-04-2018T23:05:56,Bgrmystr2,"the fuck, grandma :/"
17-04-2018T23:06:21,Bgrmystr2,The risk wasn't worth
17-04-2018T23:11:03,BadFoMo,Reminds me of the time the (I think) 80 something member or mother of a member of my 'friend's' mother's sewing guild broke her neck while dancing on a table.
17-04-2018T23:11:33,BadFoMo,She survived.
17-04-2018T23:18:52,Vatruvius,Breaking your neck does not result in a survival...maybe a compression fracture or something but a broken neck is death.
17-04-2018T23:28:17,Dadrobit,"Well, seems she's kind of awake at the moment. She's mostly upset that she disturbed the poor fish."
17-04-2018T23:28:50,Dadrobit,"But she's happy with all the Rx and ""Nature's Wonder"" that she has onboard."
17-04-2018T23:29:15,Dadrobit,"Also, no, Vat. A broken neck is only 100% fatal in the movies."
17-04-2018T23:30:32,Dadrobit,It's dangerous because the cervical area of the spine contains the nerves that control the heart and lung.
17-04-2018T23:31:09,Dadrobit,But the bones themselves can be broken without damaging the nerves and thus the person is fine in the end.
17-04-2018T23:36:58,Vatruvius,I know bones in the neck can break/fracture but a broken neck tends to mean the nerves were severed/damaged. I have never heard a someone call a neck fracture or a bone in the neck fracture a broken neck.
17-04-2018T23:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,My nana died when she fell at home and hit her head. DNR order meant the doctors weren‚Äôt allowed to save her eventhough she was save able
17-04-2018T23:48:43,Vatruvius,DNR?
17-04-2018T23:49:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Do not revive
17-04-2018T23:52:03,Bgrmystr2,DNR is sad
17-04-2018T23:54:18,Dadrobit,":/ Sad, but it's up to the person."
17-04-2018T23:54:51,SpazztasticKiwi,It was about two years after my dad died. I guess she didn‚Äôt want to be brought back if her son was gone
17-04-2018T23:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Despite having three other kids and quite a few grandkids
17-04-2018T23:55:49,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, DNR screams suicide to me. If someone sets themselves as DNR, then tries to kill themselves, there's a problem."
