08-01-2018T02:08:38,CrimsonHelsing,xD
08-01-2018T02:08:44,Serpentfrog,I like to use the Skywalker method to make pillows.
08-01-2018T02:08:50,MidnightBlue78,the eggs are back
08-01-2018T02:08:57,MidnightBlue78,And they're gone
08-01-2018T02:08:58,TheBeckoner,Definitely remembering those for a suggestion.

08-01-2018T02:09:50,ZRO4825,Yup Anjel
08-01-2018T02:09:54,Twokinds,Smart layers let you apply non-destructive effects
08-01-2018T02:09:55,CrRAR,yeah Anj
08-01-2018T02:09:55,Gelter,"to be fair, it takes a very high IQ to have only a smart layer"
08-01-2018T02:10:04,Twokinds,Then you can just turn them off and on or adjust them whenever.
08-01-2018T02:10:07,Serpentfrog,"It's pronounced brony tail, tyvm."
08-01-2018T02:10:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"oh, neato :)"
08-01-2018T02:10:16,Twokinds,"The only problem is it makes the filesize a lot bigger, lol."
08-01-2018T02:10:23,MrEase,Its pronounced Mullet
08-01-2018T02:10:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not so neato
08-01-2018T02:10:26,unsteddyphoenix,So the blur isnt permanent 'cause youre gonna turn it off?
08-01-2018T02:10:31,CrRAR,lol
08-01-2018T02:10:34,MrEase,Sythe with his hair down would be a mullet
08-01-2018T02:10:37,ZRO4825,"I'd hate to see how big your overall images saves are Tom, lol"
08-01-2018T02:10:39,Twokinds,"No, blur looks good."
08-01-2018T02:10:45,Twokinds,Nice depth of field.
08-01-2018T02:10:47,Anjelicjazz,"Oh okay,the lighting just confused me a bit"
08-01-2018T02:10:50,Serpentfrog,And you know what they say about guys with a big file size. The should learn compression.
08-01-2018T02:10:54,CrRAR,yess the depth
08-01-2018T02:10:57,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I agree
08-01-2018T02:11:01,Bgrmystr2,I never liked depth of field
08-01-2018T02:11:02,CrRAR,Like when Natani jumped from the ship!

08-01-2018T02:12:27,ZRO4825,"Depth of Field is aggravating. It's a blur that should be applied to anything you're NOT looking at, but when it's on something semi-permanent, like a portion of your screen in a game, or part of a picture, then it's just annoying when you go to focus on"
08-01-2018T02:12:34,CrimsonHelsing,I liked dis so much x3
