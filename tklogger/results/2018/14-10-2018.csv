14-10-2018T08:38:00,iliar,Nice
14-10-2018T08:45:10,CheeseRS,That's cool.
14-10-2018T08:48:03,Dadrobit,"Mmm, might miss some of it. Picking up the grandparents from the airport in a bit."
14-10-2018T08:48:48,CheeseRS,This might be the first stream I'll be fully able to enjoy :P
14-10-2018T08:49:02,CheeseRS,Because it's barely 4:49 PM here.
14-10-2018T09:03:28,CheeseRS,"Tom, did you fall asleep?"
14-10-2018T09:08:24,Pimsan,Hiya!
14-10-2018T09:08:31,CheeseRS,You're not dead!
14-10-2018T09:10:26,Njasey,not dead? means undead..
14-10-2018T09:10:50,CheeseRS,I like it that we 3 and Tom all have different shades of orange
14-10-2018T09:11:47,Njasey,50 shades or orange?
14-10-2018T09:11:56,CheeseRS,lol yeah
14-10-2018T09:12:24,thestooge,Wooooooaaaaah!!!!
14-10-2018T09:12:28,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
14-10-2018T09:12:50,CheeseRS,That pool looks a bit... lewd. :smirk:
14-10-2018T09:13:17,Njasey,"mhm, thick and long, with a wide base. perfect for long hard swims."
14-10-2018T09:13:58,Kynum,Is there an island in the pool?
14-10-2018T09:14:43,CheeseRS,Cute Flora you got there...
14-10-2018T09:15:37,thestooge,I think I've had rooms like this in a dream or two
14-10-2018T09:16:01,thestooge,WOAH!!!
14-10-2018T09:16:09,Kynum,"oh, cool. Final fantasy tactics version"
14-10-2018T09:16:35,Kynum,or maybe phantom brave
14-10-2018T09:17:01,Twokinds,Oh someone else who knows Phantom Brave?
14-10-2018T09:17:05,Twokinds,I loved that game.
14-10-2018T09:17:11,Kynum,indeed :3
14-10-2018T09:17:15,thestooge,Sounds interesting
14-10-2018T09:17:18,CheeseRS,"Mmmmnope, didn't hear of it sadly."
14-10-2018T09:17:25,RandomGuy24,"No, what is it about?"
14-10-2018T09:17:28,Kynum,NIS America game.
14-10-2018T09:17:30,Kynum,Tactics
14-10-2018T09:17:35,Twokinds,By the same people who made the Disgaea games
14-10-2018T09:17:45,Twokinds,It's a tactics style game.
14-10-2018T09:17:49,RandomGuy24,Love tactic games. Might try it.
14-10-2018T09:18:00,Kynum,definitely recommend
14-10-2018T09:18:22,Twokinds,"It's a bit ""looser"" than most tactics games, which makes it pretty unique in my opinion."
14-10-2018T09:18:36,RandomGuy24,Define looser.
14-10-2018T09:18:40,Twokinds,You move and interact via ranges rather than grids.
14-10-2018T09:18:57,Twokinds,Which leads to some manipulation of the system if you're clever enough
14-10-2018T09:18:59,thestooge,Neat
14-10-2018T09:19:16,Kynum,yeah. You could spend minutes trying to get a character to bounce a certain way
14-10-2018T09:20:05,RandomGuy24,Sounds like Mario & Rabbids Battle Kingdom.
14-10-2018T09:20:28,CheeseRS,"Tom, if you like range rather than grid, give Gunrox a try."
14-10-2018T09:20:35,thestooge,What was that small black down at the corner of the base of the pool?
14-10-2018T09:20:43,Twokinds,Way looser than Rabbids. Rabbids is pretty strict with it's numbers.
14-10-2018T09:20:43,Kynum,haven't played that one. Is that a rather recent Nintendo title?
14-10-2018T09:21:14,thestooge,Yeah
14-10-2018T09:21:23,Zakuru,Tom are you feeling well? :cold_sweat:
14-10-2018T09:21:25,Kynum,ah. Think I saw the video for that.
14-10-2018T09:21:42,Twokinds,"I love tactics games, so I've played a lot of them."

14-10-2018T09:22:39,Kynum,"Sometimes I play single player tactics games with friends. We'll take control of certain characters, and hand off the controller."
14-10-2018T09:22:41,Kynum,"sup, Zakuru"
14-10-2018T09:22:43,Mippy,Dammit Tom! It’s 8:30 AM :ctwokinds-flomad:

14-10-2018T09:36:44,Kynum,but then he took an arrow to the knee.
14-10-2018T09:37:08,CheeseRS,I didn't know painting was an adventure. :ptv-kippi3:
14-10-2018T09:37:19,CheeseRS,"Wait, it is... I'm dumb"

14-10-2018T09:52:19,RandomGuy24,Different sides of the island though.
14-10-2018T09:52:49,EdTheFolf,"Nora's just sleeping for a bit longer, she'll wake up and Carver will be the first target~"

14-10-2018T10:02:56,QuinnMalachite,"Well she is relaxing in a hot spring/Jacuzzi, she might just be in a good mood and happy!"

14-10-2018T10:10:24,ZoopBoopLoop,Maybe it's good for the baby.
14-10-2018T10:10:41,ZoopBoopLoop,Note: Not sure if baths are good for pregnant women.
14-10-2018T10:10:45,somewolfgirl,"Dogs are allergic to chocolate, he’d be allergic to himself D8"
14-10-2018T10:10:48,Kynum,"Welp, Evals, I'm sorry, but you seem to be a good source of nutrition, now."
14-10-2018T10:10:50,Kynum,Goodbye
14-10-2018T10:11:02,ZoopBoopLoop,Note 2: Don't know if baths are good for pregnant Keidran.

14-10-2018T10:11:40,Zakuru,you'd think that keidran dogs would be purebreeds or something

14-10-2018T10:16:10,QuinnMalachite,It would feel weird for Flora to put more clothes on to go swimming
14-10-2018T10:16:34,QuinnMalachite,"besides that these two don't have any clothes, Mike looks like he's wearing Saria's pyjamas"
14-10-2018T10:16:41,Tharkis,"flora in a japanese school swimsuit, her name in katakana across the front"

14-10-2018T10:35:09,FoxxTrotter,Must be Old Welsh.
14-10-2018T10:35:13,EdTheFolf,I read that right now.
14-10-2018T10:35:51,QuinnMalachite,So is the average human well educated by our standards or to more medieval standards?
14-10-2018T10:36:32,EdTheFolf,I'm guessing medieval.
14-10-2018T10:38:30,somewolfgirl,Awoo
14-10-2018T10:38:35,Katfeathers,I'd guess bit more than midieval but not as good as today

14-10-2018T10:50:07,Twokinds,I've had it in my head for a long time
14-10-2018T10:50:25,EdTheFolf,"I barely have a coffee a week, even less."
14-10-2018T10:50:30,TerraTheWizard,ew coffee
14-10-2018T10:50:37,QuinnMalachite,"My father used to be like that, started the day with a double sized coffee, had finished five by mid day"
14-10-2018T10:50:43,QuinnMalachite,He's immune to caffeine now
14-10-2018T10:50:49,Zakuru,ed this is only during school
14-10-2018T10:50:52,EdTheFolf,That's my mom.
14-10-2018T10:50:55,Zakuru,during the summer i barely drink coffee
14-10-2018T10:50:57,MrEase,whoa Tom's streaming

14-10-2018T10:51:01,TerraTheWizard,ohi ease
14-10-2018T10:51:01,QuinnMalachite,Hey Ease
14-10-2018T10:51:03,Twokinds,It's a room inside the estate that's made to look like a beach / spa
14-10-2018T10:51:08,TerraTheWizard,fancy
14-10-2018T10:51:10,EdTheFolf,Hey Ease!
14-10-2018T10:51:21,Skythe,"All Hail Tom! And wow...that's crazy, but when you have a Legacy like Trace, no surprise....get it?"
14-10-2018T10:51:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that looks like it cost's money
14-10-2018T10:51:34,QuinnMalachite,So is this actually on the outside of the estate or is magic involved here?
14-10-2018T10:51:41,Twokinds,No it's an interior room
14-10-2018T10:51:51,Twokinds,Just magicked to look like the outside.
14-10-2018T10:51:56,QuinnMalachite,that's really cool
14-10-2018T10:52:00,Tharkis,"it's cool, i like the concept"
14-10-2018T10:52:01,EdTheFolf,>magicked
14-10-2018T10:52:02,Twokinds,So it's warm in here while it's snowing outside.
14-10-2018T10:52:06,Katfeathers,The right creamer and generous suger do wonder for even scorched coffee.
14-10-2018T10:52:09,Kitsune713,"this is so cool, I've been reading the comic for ages, and now I'm watching it be made!"
14-10-2018T10:52:19,Tharkis,i could use a room magiced to be warm while it's cold outside right about now
14-10-2018T10:52:32,EdTheFolf,"Me too Tharkis, me too..."
14-10-2018T10:52:41,Tharkis,i'm playing the 'how long can i go without turning the heat on this year' game right now
14-10-2018T10:53:03,EdTheFolf,"I turned it on about 2 weeks ago, rip bills."
14-10-2018T10:53:14,QuinnMalachite,"I moved to Canada this year, it's snowed at least five times since August"
14-10-2018T10:53:24,QuinnMalachite,I've actually lost count
14-10-2018T10:53:25,EdTheFolf,"Welcome to Canada, eh?"
14-10-2018T10:53:29,QuinnMalachite,yep
14-10-2018T10:53:40,QuinnMalachite,"heating is included in the rent though, central to the building"
14-10-2018T10:53:51,EdTheFolf,Ain't that a win.
14-10-2018T10:54:03,MrEase,thats insane :V
14-10-2018T10:55:47,EdTheFolf,I think I figured out what Flora is screaming at Evals...
14-10-2018T10:55:57,QuinnMalachite,"""Rawr"" ?"
14-10-2018T10:56:01,EdTheFolf,lol
14-10-2018T10:56:16,EdTheFolf,THIS IS THE BEST ROOM I AM NEVER LEAVING AGAIN
14-10-2018T10:56:53,somewolfgirl,“Rawr! I’m a tiger shark!” Evals “thst seems fishy”
14-10-2018T10:56:54,Skythe,makes sense
14-10-2018T10:57:14,Skythe,Evals <3
14-10-2018T10:57:36,Kitsune713,"wait, I don't think that's Flora, looks like a different tiger o.o"
14-10-2018T10:57:44,EdTheFolf,Every sexy Keidran/Basitin :yellow_heart:
14-10-2018T10:57:50,Skythe,"that's Florida, I mean Flora"
14-10-2018T10:57:50,Kitsune713,atleast one of the bottom panels sure doesn't look like Flora
14-10-2018T10:58:03,Skythe,"see, the Antennae?"
14-10-2018T10:58:15,EdTheFolf,Florida Xd.
14-10-2018T10:59:20,Kitsune713,huh that wink makes her look really different to me XD
14-10-2018T10:59:20,somewolfgirl,I’m drinking a Yoohoo ❤️
14-10-2018T11:00:07,Skythe,I call those Yahoos for some reason
14-10-2018T11:00:11,EdTheFolf,I know @Kitsune713 Flora really looks lewd~
14-10-2018T11:00:19,Skythe,could be an illusion
14-10-2018T11:01:12,Skythe,why do I feel the heart pattern undies ain't Eval's to begin with?
14-10-2018T11:01:42,EdTheFolf,boi I had the whole stream paused for like 10 minutes and I thought why doesn't Tom draw anymore???
14-10-2018T11:02:03,EdTheFolf,The page looks much better while it's progressing.
14-10-2018T11:02:08,Katfeathers,D'oh
14-10-2018T11:02:15,Mippy,Connection still sucks
14-10-2018T11:02:25,EdTheFolf,"Hey Mippy, rip."

14-10-2018T11:02:59,QuinnMalachite,o/
14-10-2018T11:03:28,somewolfgirl,Flora gonna shake off?

14-10-2018T17:22:21,Bgrmystr2,"if you're talking about w0lf's emote, it's fairly new Kiwi"
14-10-2018T17:22:27,Bgrmystr2,cuz he hasn't used it before
14-10-2018T17:22:34,Bgrmystr2,it's new to me at least
14-10-2018T17:22:47,Bgrmystr2,but he's usually pretty open about using his new emotes so
14-10-2018T17:23:52,Bgrmystr2,the sad trace emote is very old
14-10-2018T17:23:56,Bgrmystr2,and just not commonly used
14-10-2018T17:50:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Looks like Flora’s wantin a lil soak with her husband in the new page
14-10-2018T18:03:44,unsteddyphoenix,Ayyyy finally
14-10-2018T18:03:48,unsteddyphoenix,the beach episode
14-10-2018T18:04:41,unsteddyphoenix,Yet to see any bikinis though
14-10-2018T18:06:08,Twokinds,furkinis
14-10-2018T18:07:02,unsteddyphoenix,Those too
14-10-2018T18:07:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Unless, that's what theyre always wearing :thinking:"
14-10-2018T18:08:10,Xexanoth,isn't a furkini when there's only fur over the important bits?
14-10-2018T18:08:25,CrRAR,dat compluvium doe
14-10-2018T18:09:57,unsteddyphoenix,The room isnt magically embiggened right? It's all an illusion?
14-10-2018T18:10:04,unsteddyphoenix,I assume this was covered during the stream
14-10-2018T18:10:47,Xexanoth,didn't Tom post the room sketch on twitter?
14-10-2018T18:10:47,Twokinds,It's not a TARDIS
14-10-2018T18:11:01,unsteddyphoenix,that's a different room
14-10-2018T18:11:01,CrRAR,"hey, if bags can be enchanted to hold more, why not rooms?"
14-10-2018T18:11:05,Twokinds,The room is enchanted to feel like a beach.
14-10-2018T18:11:14,CrRAR,ahh
14-10-2018T18:11:32,CrRAR,hurry someone get the lens of truth.
14-10-2018T18:11:57,Twokinds,"It's a big room, but you will hit a wall if you go far enough out."
14-10-2018T18:12:13,Xexanoth,https://twitter.com/TwoKinds/status/1051931834823659521/ that's the room sketch i meant
14-10-2018T18:12:41,CrRAR,that's the safe to swim barrier
14-10-2018T18:13:06,unsteddyphoenix,"I see, figured as much"
14-10-2018T18:13:14,unsteddyphoenix,It was either that or some subtle portal
14-10-2018T18:13:42,Bgrmystr2,a portal to a real beach? That big?
14-10-2018T18:13:51,Bgrmystr2,that'd be pretty frickin' awesome
14-10-2018T18:14:01,Xexanoth,"dam wall illusion, when i was young we built a proper ocean into our mansionx XD"
14-10-2018T18:14:19,Twokinds,lol
14-10-2018T18:14:47,Twokinds,"One of the walls has an invisible hidden door. Though it doesn't lead to anything sinister, just beach stuff."
14-10-2018T18:15:05,CrRAR,That's where they store the floaties
14-10-2018T18:15:15,Bgrmystr2,legit cool
14-10-2018T18:15:42,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
14-10-2018T18:15:44,Bgrmystr2,"Evil trace may have been evil, but gotta give him some credit. Dude's got some damn style"
14-10-2018T18:16:01,unsteddyphoenix,Scatter those around the mansion as a prank for thieves
14-10-2018T18:18:46,CrRAR,"in addition to floaties, the doors possibly also contain the incantation for the unchickening spell."
14-10-2018T18:22:26,Xexanoth,or just tons of cheese
14-10-2018T18:22:42,Xexanoth,just one of Nora's pranks
14-10-2018T18:22:48,CrRAR,...cheese...
14-10-2018T18:22:56,CrRAR,for the MOUSE ARMADA!
14-10-2018T18:23:56,unsteddyphoenix,Are these fish in the beach
14-10-2018T18:24:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, a giant beach aquarium"
14-10-2018T18:27:44,CrRAR,no expense spared
14-10-2018T18:28:19,CrRAR,The fish serve Trace loyally foreverrr
14-10-2018T18:28:54,CrRAR,constantly. swimming.
14-10-2018T18:29:12,unsteddyphoenix,"but ready to attack, just in case"
14-10-2018T18:29:23,CrRAR,haha
14-10-2018T18:29:37,unsteddyphoenix,in case beach-negotiations break down
14-10-2018T18:29:43,CrRAR,^
14-10-2018T18:30:11,CrRAR,Every room has a hidden diabolical downfall.
14-10-2018T18:30:44,unsteddyphoenix,ooo I like that idea lol
14-10-2018T18:30:52,CrRAR,Just a snap of Trace's fingers away~
14-10-2018T18:31:47,CrRAR,"""So... are you prepared to tender me the hostages?"""
14-10-2018T18:31:50,CrRAR,*snaps*

14-10-2018T18:33:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Flora was joking about tigersharks, little does she know..."
14-10-2018T18:35:55,CrRAR,haha
14-10-2018T18:36:16,Ordithus,"I too, commend thee of this cool room.  Magic, it's awesome."
14-10-2018T18:43:35,CrRAR,also $5 on the secret door being under the waterfall
14-10-2018T18:44:08,Bgrmystr2,well obviously
14-10-2018T18:44:15,Ordithus,:ocean::ctwokinds-katwet:
14-10-2018T18:44:22,Ordithus,Sounds very wet
14-10-2018T18:44:39,CrRAR,it's worth the sacrifice
14-10-2018T18:49:43,Bgrmystr2,you're not going to need >Obviously for water< items unless you are planning to do stuff in the water

14-10-2018T19:15:51,Xexanoth,Clovis is just there as undercover boss
14-10-2018T19:19:14,Twokinds,I guess owning a lesbian bar would make a certain amount of sense for the prince.
14-10-2018T19:20:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm: *princess
14-10-2018T19:21:00,Twokinds,"Right, of course."
14-10-2018T19:26:44,Xexanoth,the most amusing thing for me is still that raine is more concerned with making an excuse for being in the bar than wondering why those two are woman
14-10-2018T19:27:14,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, Raine might not even know they aren't women."
14-10-2018T19:27:19,Bgrmystr2,:P
14-10-2018T19:27:32,Ordithus,Good point
14-10-2018T19:27:53,Bgrmystr2,she's had interactions with them.. how many times? xD
14-10-2018T19:28:21,Bgrmystr2,and all of it in the patreon sketches too
14-10-2018T19:28:52,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think they even met in the comic proper, or if they did, it was off-screen"
14-10-2018T19:33:19,Ordithus,The only sketch I can think of is where Raine is about to maul Evals for the rubber duckie
14-10-2018T19:33:32,Bgrmystr2,lool
14-10-2018T19:37:14,Ordithus,"Oh, there was Shifters Night Out.  Mike was a girl in that one. https://www.patreon.com/posts/shifters-night-8832792"
14-10-2018T19:38:10,Bgrmystr2,"well hey, if that's connected to the bar one we just got.. in it's own canonical setting"
14-10-2018T19:38:17,Bgrmystr2,then Raine already knows why they're female
14-10-2018T19:38:30,Bgrmystr2,cuz (s)he already told her in that first one
14-10-2018T19:38:42,Mippy,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
14-10-2018T20:05:44,qwe304,"so... is the room a portal, a pocket dimension, or something closer to a holodeck"
14-10-2018T20:06:16,Bgrmystr2,no it's just a room
14-10-2018T20:11:32,Bgrmystr2,"It's prolly got magic to look really big, but it's just a normal room where if you go far enough out, there's a wall."
14-10-2018T20:11:50,Bgrmystr2,tom was talking about it earlier.
14-10-2018T20:18:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"For me, I don’t see them going into heat since they’re only physically female. Unless the internal organ system was changed too"
14-10-2018T20:18:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"In that case, haha"
14-10-2018T20:20:21,Twokinds,"At least in Mike's case, he certainly wouldn't."
14-10-2018T20:21:12,Bgrmystr2,"well.. the internal organs are also physical, but yeh"
14-10-2018T20:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Female organs are not
14-10-2018T20:25:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you saying Evals has a possibility of going into heat
14-10-2018T20:26:28,Bgrmystr2,uwot how are female organs not physical? XD
14-10-2018T20:26:35,Bgrmystr2,are they mental instead?
14-10-2018T20:26:37,SpazztasticKiwi,As in can be seen
14-10-2018T20:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Ie “external”
14-10-2018T20:27:03,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, so metaphorical :ptv-laugh:"
14-10-2018T20:27:23,Ordithus,They only look like girls
14-10-2018T20:27:24,Bgrmystr2,I get what you mean
14-10-2018T20:28:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"To put even more simply - Mike not going into heat but physically looking female either means no organs at all, he got essentially fixed, or his lady bits are defective"
14-10-2018T20:29:30,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: no organs! He's a ghost!
14-10-2018T20:29:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure if I want to know which of those options I’d like to hear confirmed
14-10-2018T20:30:02,Bgrmystr2,haha
14-10-2018T20:30:42,Ordithus,"No matter what, poor Mike"
14-10-2018T20:31:09,Dadrobit,Metaphysical Ovaries. What will magic science come up with next?
14-10-2018T20:31:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully a cure for going into heat at all
14-10-2018T20:31:37,Bgrmystr2,"I think it's only visually female for mike. It wears off, so it's all magical."
14-10-2018T20:31:51,Bgrmystr2,"Unlike Natani's magic, which couldn't hide her physical body"
14-10-2018T20:31:54,Bgrmystr2,Nora's magic can
14-10-2018T20:32:19,Bgrmystr2,but Mike's still male there
14-10-2018T20:32:43,Bgrmystr2,Evals we just.. don't know what happened to him to make him female lol
14-10-2018T20:32:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Self-realization?
14-10-2018T20:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I can understand Nat’s situation better than Mike/Evals
14-10-2018T20:36:38,SpazztasticKiwi,It’d be interesting to see if Nat would take an offer of turning physically male for heat and then swapping back. Kind of like a MENstrual period
14-10-2018T20:37:07,Bgrmystr2,boo :u
14-10-2018T20:38:11,Bgrmystr2,Mike was just magic'd by nora to be female cuz it was funny
14-10-2018T20:39:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"To be fair, it’d be a stupid question “do you want to be a guy for a week instead of feeling like your ovaries are playing rugby”"
14-10-2018T20:40:39,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-10-2018T20:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Just like the question “would you act gay for a year for $17 billion”
14-10-2018T20:41:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"For $17 billion, I’d ACTIVELY be gay, what are you talking about"
14-10-2018T20:41:46,Ordithus,Sacrifices must be made
14-10-2018T20:42:03,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
14-10-2018T21:04:53,Ordithus,Wait until the Templar figure out that 90+% of the towers' output goes to the estate for features like this
14-10-2018T21:21:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone had kettle cooked chips
14-10-2018T21:22:04,Twokinds,I don't know...
14-10-2018T21:23:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I just wanna know if they’re any good
14-10-2018T21:23:22,Ordithus,"Yes, and yes."
14-10-2018T21:23:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Are they like baked chips
14-10-2018T21:24:07,Ordithus,"No, they're fried.  Just in small batches."
14-10-2018T21:24:23,Ordithus,Very crunchy
14-10-2018T21:24:27,Ordithus,Yum
14-10-2018T21:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’m looking for something similar to baked
14-10-2018T21:24:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause I can eat a whole bag of baked potato chips
14-10-2018T21:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"This does remind me that someone brought me some sushi to throw out cause it had gotten too warm to sell and told me, “these are from automotive (department)”"
14-10-2018T21:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,For the life of me the only thing I was imagining was sushi made by an auto department
14-10-2018T21:26:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Mmmm oil soy sauce
14-10-2018T21:26:36,Ordithus,Imported with the car
14-10-2018T21:26:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m tired
14-10-2018T21:26:48,Ordithus,Well then take a nap
14-10-2018T21:27:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m in the middle of Walmart
14-10-2018T21:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I will not be a Walmart weirdo
14-10-2018T21:33:09,Twokinds,I am tired
14-10-2018T21:33:23,Twokinds,I'm gunna hit the hay
