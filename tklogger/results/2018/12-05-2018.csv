12-05-2018T14:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Weakest muscled finger is the ring one but the weakest bone‚Äôs probably the pinky

12-05-2018T22:08:27,Bgrmystr2,trace seems to have helped that
12-05-2018T22:08:50,Bgrmystr2,"if she still is, she doesn't really show it. Maybe in sketches and stuff"
12-05-2018T22:09:01,BluePhantom90,yeah but if there is a Bath scene she will be that way again I think
12-05-2018T22:09:10,unsteddyphoenix,Most of those jokes are in the sketches now
12-05-2018T22:09:20,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: that's.. not how character development works, blue lol"

12-05-2018T22:11:49,unsteddyphoenix,Havent they been getting gradually bigger even before the skip?
12-05-2018T22:11:54,Ordithus,You are a cruel creator

12-05-2018T22:13:12,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
12-05-2018T22:13:23,Ordithus,Probably the skip to the start of Edinmire
12-05-2018T22:13:35,Ordithus,There was a two week skip then
12-05-2018T22:14:14,Bgrmystr2,I didn't notice any time skip since the boat ride
12-05-2018T22:14:17,Bgrmystr2,"least, I don't recall"
12-05-2018T22:14:19,Ordithus,"The most recent ""skip"" was like a day"
12-05-2018T22:14:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's why I was confused lol

12-05-2018T22:31:48,SpazztasticKiwi,How do y‚Äôall think I celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day?

12-05-2018T22:33:32,Bgrmystr2,"Should we be as thrifty as you, tom.."
12-05-2018T22:34:31,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom and sister are kinda hard to shop for
12-05-2018T22:34:32,unsteddyphoenix,Only time I buy sweets is to sneak them into movies
12-05-2018T22:34:57,unsteddyphoenix,That way you get the same FEELING of cheating the system
12-05-2018T22:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,We‚Äôre not big on celebrating holidays anyway. Most of them are like another day
12-05-2018T22:36:41,Twokinds,same same same
12-05-2018T22:37:08,unsteddyphoenix,Halloween seems a lot bigger in the US than anywhere else
12-05-2018T22:37:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve not really even celebrated my own birthday since I was like 12
12-05-2018T22:38:03,Bgrmystr2,"terrible, Kiwi"

12-05-2018T22:38:10,unsteddyphoenix,"mm, same"
12-05-2018T22:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad died 28 days after my 12th birthday
12-05-2018T22:38:42,unsteddyphoenix,my borthdays closish to christmas so most people are on vacation at the time
12-05-2018T22:39:37,Bgrmystr2,My bday is 2 days before the country's bday.. so my friends all left town.. most of my childhood birthdays had noone there but me :v
12-05-2018T22:39:44,Bgrmystr2,Still celebrate it.
12-05-2018T22:40:12,unsteddyphoenix,Eh thats wooork. Plus you have to acknowledge time passing
12-05-2018T22:40:13,BluePhantom90,BTW Tom did you see the Avengers Infinity war? ( and No I wont spoil it for you guys if you didn't see it)
12-05-2018T22:40:16,unsteddyphoenix,And I aint about that
12-05-2018T22:40:16,Bgrmystr2,Now I live where people can't afford to vacation so :D
12-05-2018T22:40:33,Bgrmystr2,it's not work though phoenix
12-05-2018T22:40:46,unsteddyphoenix,much more fun celebrating someone elses birthday
12-05-2018T22:40:52,Bgrmystr2,"I don't do anything during my birthday really. I eat cake, cookies, and get presents."
12-05-2018T22:41:02,Bgrmystr2,I think you definitely have it backwards lol
12-05-2018T22:42:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll sometimes get myself something
12-05-2018T22:44:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Like snacks I don‚Äôt normally get cause they‚Äôre so bad for you
12-05-2018T22:44:38,unsteddyphoenix,ehh
12-05-2018T22:44:46,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe if theyre on sale¬¨
12-05-2018T22:45:08,SpazztasticKiwi,We‚Äôve never really been much to celebrate birthdays and holidays
12-05-2018T22:46:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Some of them are too overhyped anyway
12-05-2018T22:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,And it‚Äôs just been getting more expensive to celebrate anymore
12-05-2018T22:46:35,unsteddyphoenix,"Its more for those ""disposable income"" type families"
12-05-2018T22:46:38,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
12-05-2018T22:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,More of a homebody person myself
12-05-2018T22:48:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Sit and watch tv or a movie with my cats
12-05-2018T22:48:57,unsteddyphoenix,Going outside is wild
12-05-2018T22:49:10,unsteddyphoenix,I was approached about drugs by strangers TWICE yesterday
12-05-2018T22:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Not worth the risk or social interaction
12-05-2018T22:49:24,SpazztasticKiwi,*of
12-05-2018T22:49:28,unsteddyphoenix,Never happened to me before and it happens twice in one day
12-05-2018T22:50:14,Bgrmystr2,jeez
12-05-2018T22:50:45,unsteddyphoenix,Stay indoors kids.
12-05-2018T22:51:01,unsteddyphoenix,"To be fair it's probably related to my hair, I need to cute it."
12-05-2018T22:51:04,unsteddyphoenix,*cut
12-05-2018T22:51:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, both."
12-05-2018T22:51:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta cut it so it‚Äôs cuter
12-05-2018T22:51:34,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: Cute your hair, firebirb"
12-05-2018T22:52:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Put a pretty little bow in it. They won‚Äôt approach you then
12-05-2018T22:52:21,unsteddyphoenix,They might approach me for a different reason~
12-05-2018T22:52:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Can‚Äôt a grown man wear a bow in their hair and not have the cops called?
12-05-2018T22:53:05,unsteddyphoenix,In current year!
12-05-2018T22:53:11,Bgrmystr2,No kiwi
12-05-2018T22:53:12,Bgrmystr2,xD
12-05-2018T22:53:14,unsteddyphoenix,Cmon people~
12-05-2018T22:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Outrageous
12-05-2018T22:53:31,unsteddyphoenix,How do you talk to hairdressers though I dont speak their language
12-05-2018T22:53:49,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI want to look human‚Äù
12-05-2018T22:54:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúNot trendy, a trim‚Äù"
12-05-2018T22:54:03,Bgrmystr2,"I just go and say ""I want my usual"" they seem to know whatit means"
12-05-2018T22:54:24,Bgrmystr2,and then she cuts it all spikey
12-05-2018T22:54:26,Bgrmystr2,and it looks great
12-05-2018T22:54:28,Bgrmystr2,:D
12-05-2018T22:54:34,SpazztasticKiwi,A pixie cut was proposed to me once
12-05-2018T22:54:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Curly hair and pixie cut don‚Äôt mix
12-05-2018T22:54:48,unsteddyphoenix,I have big fat dumb curly hair and it seems to frighten them
12-05-2018T22:55:23,Bgrmystr2,"Find a professional, and it won't."
12-05-2018T22:55:35,Bgrmystr2,unless your hair is /that/ bad
12-05-2018T22:55:53,unsteddyphoenix,"""just...make it shorter and not terrible"""
12-05-2018T22:56:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"And wash it first, so they don‚Äôt give you a shampoo and then charge you for that"
12-05-2018T22:56:19,unsteddyphoenix,ooo protips
12-05-2018T22:56:24,Bgrmystr2,"Down here, they wash it anyway"
12-05-2018T22:56:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve had salons try that one on me
12-05-2018T22:56:30,Bgrmystr2,irrelevant if you washed it first
12-05-2018T22:56:38,Bgrmystr2,but I dunno if they charge you
12-05-2018T22:56:48,Bgrmystr2,don't think the wash is extra
12-05-2018T22:57:04,TorqueEmUp,"I've had the same person cut my hair, since I have had hair to cut."
12-05-2018T22:57:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Some places I‚Äôve been do some include it in the price
12-05-2018T22:57:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Others do it without asking and then charge
12-05-2018T22:58:02,TorqueEmUp,and probably will continue to have my hair cut by her until she can no longer do it.
12-05-2018T22:58:28,unsteddyphoenix,im jealous~
12-05-2018T22:58:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Just shave it all off. Solves the problem pretty well
12-05-2018T22:59:03,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true.
12-05-2018T22:59:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, think you‚Äôll ever get your fluff cut back?"
12-05-2018T22:59:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Or I could stay in my room forever, then it'll never matter"
12-05-2018T22:59:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Grow it out to become cousin It
12-05-2018T23:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúLadies, you said you liked hair on a man. How‚Äôs this?‚Äù"
12-05-2018T23:00:32,TorqueEmUp,Really long hair I find is pretty gross.
12-05-2018T23:01:29,SpazztasticKiwi,It can be. But that‚Äôs where maintenance adds in
12-05-2018T23:01:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Long hair can be attractive if you tend and care for it
12-05-2018T23:02:02,TorqueEmUp,indeed
12-05-2018T23:02:37,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I prefer long hair but its def more work
12-05-2018T23:03:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Gotta wash it more, there‚Äôs more brushing, and then there‚Äôs the fun of a windy day..."
12-05-2018T23:03:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Welcome to my world
12-05-2018T23:03:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Invest in hair ties. They can be your friend
12-05-2018T23:05:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Or braiding. Braiding you gotta learn though
12-05-2018T23:05:43,unsteddyphoenix,Im a simple man braids are out of my league
12-05-2018T23:05:58,unsteddyphoenix,Thoughts on manbuns :thinking:
12-05-2018T23:06:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a fan
12-05-2018T23:06:13,SpazztasticKiwi,At all
12-05-2018T23:06:31,unsteddyphoenix,but ponytails are fine?
12-05-2018T23:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Ponytails serve to keep hair out of the face and stay cool
12-05-2018T23:07:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone I‚Äôve met with a man bun‚Äôs been generally annoying
12-05-2018T23:09:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Or just a dick
12-05-2018T23:09:37,unsteddyphoenix,hmm im already those things no sense amplifying it I guess
12-05-2018T23:09:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But I also live in jacked-up truck country so that could be a factor
12-05-2018T23:10:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm talking ‚Äúsmoking a cigarette within 3 feet of a restaurant door‚Äù dick
12-05-2018T23:11:20,unsteddyphoenix,unconscionable
12-05-2018T23:11:31,unsteddyphoenix,Thank god there dont seem to be many smokers around here
12-05-2018T23:11:45,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
12-05-2018T23:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can‚Äôt stand cigarettes. Someone lights up around me, I move"
12-05-2018T23:12:08,Bgrmystr2,I've never heard that word before
12-05-2018T23:12:11,Bgrmystr2,I had to look it up lol
12-05-2018T23:12:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Which word?
12-05-2018T23:13:11,Bgrmystr2,"oh, unconscionable"
12-05-2018T23:13:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Fancy words
12-05-2018T23:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,We‚Äôre fancy people
12-05-2018T23:16:37,Bgrmystr2,"I know lots of fancy words lol, can't know all of em though"
12-05-2018T23:16:51,Bgrmystr2,add one to the mental dictionary till I forget it :v

12-05-2018T23:31:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And not Ord even though you‚Äôre probably long gone already
12-05-2018T23:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,*nite
12-05-2018T23:32:17,unsteddyphoenix,donate attentions to local cat
12-05-2018T23:34:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Cat demands all pets
12-05-2018T23:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially head rubs
