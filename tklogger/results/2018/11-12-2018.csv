11-12-2018T12:09:33,Mippy,Morning Tom! I am no longer dieing in work.

11-12-2018T12:43:07,Xexanoth,"Nora Card version is just Flora going: I can barely draw, how do you expect me to colour this!"

11-12-2018T12:52:21,SpazztasticKiwi,She colors it with an orange juuuuuust off enough for it to bug everyone
11-12-2018T12:52:38,SpazztasticKiwi,And then does the lines in the wrong direction
11-12-2018T13:10:14,CrimsonQuill,Sounds accurate.
11-12-2018T13:18:24,Mippy,:ctwokinds-FloDance: Almost done for winter break
11-12-2018T13:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta go into work. I’ll see y’all later

11-12-2018T13:26:38,Xexanoth,"Flora going for the ""pixel art"" style XD"
11-12-2018T13:26:57,Xexanoth,or rather early 3d games
11-12-2018T13:27:37,Xexanoth,polygons was the word i meant to use not pixels :/
11-12-2018T13:28:39,iliar,Drawing bad is very simple if you actually can't draw.
11-12-2018T13:28:47,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
11-12-2018T13:29:25,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs...
11-12-2018T13:29:45,CrimsonQuill,My question is how did you get such a high-quality pic from one of the panels.

11-12-2018T14:45:56,CrimsonQuill,"Good, thanks."
11-12-2018T15:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Still say she’d color it just slightly off enough to bug someone
11-12-2018T15:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Like “eggshell” white instead of white

11-12-2018T16:21:07,Twokinds,He still has it
11-12-2018T16:23:51,Mippy,"Cool, just had to ask. Representation for the verbally challenged is kind is difficult to find. XD"
11-12-2018T16:25:29,Mippy,Oh boy...I’m gonna sleep for a week after exam week is done

11-12-2018T16:53:21,RimaDraws,i am back after a day of my internet being out
11-12-2018T18:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,New dude asked me what I wanted for the secret santa we’re having in deli
11-12-2018T18:24:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone know what’s wrong with that sentence?
11-12-2018T18:25:25,RimaDraws,hmm
11-12-2018T18:26:54,RimaDraws,the entire thing
11-12-2018T18:27:18,SpazztasticKiwi,“SECRET” santa
11-12-2018T18:27:25,SpazztasticKiwi,And he asked me what I wanted
11-12-2018T18:27:36,RimaDraws,LOL
11-12-2018T18:27:37,RimaDraws,wow
11-12-2018T18:30:54,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-wondering: could be asking for a coworker, but yknow"
11-12-2018T18:32:28,unsteddyphoenix,"My """""" friend"""""" wants to know what youd want"
11-12-2018T18:32:37,unsteddyphoenix,(Nailed it)
11-12-2018T18:33:45,SpazztasticKiwi,The only reason he’d be asking me is if he drew my name
11-12-2018T18:34:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Because besides him, none of us know who each other drew"
11-12-2018T18:41:34,RimaDraws,lol
11-12-2018T18:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can get it since he’s newer and doesn’t know any of us, but like I’m doing, a box of chocolates is neutral enough"
11-12-2018T18:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t know what he’s getting - he said he “knew exactly what he was getting” just before he left today
11-12-2018T18:57:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Well lunch is over
11-12-2018T19:03:22,Bgrmystr2,secret santas usually concede with coworkers getting together to help each other get someone else a gift while making sure they don't tell the person that's getting the present
11-12-2018T19:03:45,Bgrmystr2,"somehow, it works"
11-12-2018T19:05:14,Bgrmystr2,"Not knowing what to get someone is fairly common, this is why you ask other coworkers about if they spend time with such person, and thus, learning things that they want or need."
11-12-2018T20:43:25,Twokinds,Or give them money :D
11-12-2018T20:49:48,Bgrmystr2,"mmmmmmoney works. :thinking: I mean, it feels like a cheap-out kinda thing, but buying a pre-paid debit mastercard or whatnot with like $50 or somesuch.. that gives the person the ability to get prettymuch whatever they want"
11-12-2018T20:50:10,Bgrmystr2,I'd be okay with that
11-12-2018T20:50:52,unsteddyphoenix,Nah money is best
11-12-2018T20:51:24,Twokinds,Pff
11-12-2018T20:51:27,unsteddyphoenix,Tom i paid my patreon subscription merry chriatmas :D
11-12-2018T20:51:45,Twokinds,Prepaid cards take like 4 - 7 dollars to buy.
11-12-2018T20:52:05,Twokinds,Might as well give them all the money and not pay VISA or MASTERCARD for the privilage.
11-12-2018T20:52:37,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed
11-12-2018T20:52:44,Bgrmystr2,no they don't
11-12-2018T20:52:48,Bgrmystr2,wtf card do you buy?
11-12-2018T20:52:58,unsteddyphoenix,Just colour in the cash to make them more festive!
11-12-2018T20:53:12,Bgrmystr2,I've bought like 5 or 6 different kind of pre-paid debit cards and they don't charge a penny more than how much you put on the card.
11-12-2018T20:53:24,Bgrmystr2,no tax either
11-12-2018T20:53:26,Twokinds,"Any prepaid debit cards have to be bought, in the US."
11-12-2018T20:53:44,Bgrmystr2,Might be a state thing.
11-12-2018T20:54:35,Twokinds,Every visa gift card I've ever seen has a fee.
11-12-2018T20:54:53,Twokinds,And I've bought them in different states.
11-12-2018T20:54:57,Bgrmystr2,"Strange, I've never paid a cent more than what I put on the card. :thinking:"
11-12-2018T20:55:06,Twokinds,I'd love if that were true!
11-12-2018T20:55:12,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe you never knew! :0
11-12-2018T20:55:25,unsteddyphoenix,Aecretly charged the whole time...
11-12-2018T20:55:53,Bgrmystr2,"lol, secretly charged my non-existant bank account.. or all the money in my wallet, yes."
11-12-2018T20:55:55,Bgrmystr2,definitely xD
11-12-2018T20:56:25,unsteddyphoenix,You dont have a bank account?
11-12-2018T20:57:42,Bgrmystr2,nope
11-12-2018T20:58:05,Bgrmystr2,they all charge bullshit amounts of money per month unless you have like $500+ in there
11-12-2018T20:58:08,Bgrmystr2,and keep it in there
11-12-2018T20:58:51,Bgrmystr2,"if not, they charge you like $10+ per month, I've gotten $16 fees for having less than $60 in the bank."
11-12-2018T20:58:59,Bgrmystr2,it's dumb as shit
11-12-2018T20:59:07,Bgrmystr2,so I said fuck em
11-12-2018T20:59:15,Bgrmystr2,And I don't use any banks
11-12-2018T20:59:48,Twokinds,Huh
11-12-2018T20:59:50,Bgrmystr2,"I used to have Capital One where they had no fee for checking account, then they changed it, and that was the last time I had an account."
11-12-2018T21:00:08,Twokinds,So do you just use a home safe?
11-12-2018T21:00:15,Bgrmystr2,lol I use paypal
11-12-2018T21:00:30,Bgrmystr2,no fees ever
11-12-2018T21:00:36,Bgrmystr2,money back debit card
11-12-2018T21:00:46,Twokinds,"Oh, I see."
11-12-2018T21:00:48,Bgrmystr2,"either that, or what's in my waller"
11-12-2018T21:00:52,Bgrmystr2,..wallet* even
11-12-2018T21:01:33,Bgrmystr2,haha I have like $2 in my wallet
11-12-2018T21:01:48,Twokinds,More than me! My wallet is totally empty.

11-12-2018T21:02:22,Bgrmystr2,I expected mine to be empty but I guess it isn't.
11-12-2018T21:03:49,Bgrmystr2,I've been looking for online banks that don't charge for low money in the checking account
11-12-2018T21:04:21,Bgrmystr2,"There was one I found a few years back, but I don't recall what it was"
11-12-2018T21:04:34,Bgrmystr2,"don't have the name anymore, it was before my HD died."
11-12-2018T21:06:12,Twokinds,What about savings account?
11-12-2018T21:07:00,Bgrmystr2,"nope, don't have one of those. I don't even have enough money to put into one. It'd be at bear minimum almost all the time"
11-12-2018T21:07:26,Bgrmystr2,and they gain what.. 3 cent on the dollar per year? If that..
11-12-2018T21:07:27,unsteddyphoenix,Rip
11-12-2018T21:07:39,Bgrmystr2,"I don't recall what it was, but it was really silly low"
11-12-2018T21:08:07,unsteddyphoenix,Nz has a system where if you sign up with a savings account bwfore 18 you get a free $1000 in it
11-12-2018T21:08:14,Bgrmystr2,wtf
11-12-2018T21:08:18,Bgrmystr2,gimme
11-12-2018T21:08:20,unsteddyphoenix,Probably to circumvent that very problem
11-12-2018T21:08:22,Bgrmystr2,I want that
11-12-2018T21:08:28,Twokinds,lol
11-12-2018T21:08:46,Twokinds,Ally Bank offers no maintenance fees and no minimum balance
11-12-2018T21:08:53,unsteddyphoenix,Just go back in time real quick
11-12-2018T21:09:03,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like an ally
11-12-2018T21:09:39,Twokinds,Their savings accounts give 2% APY
11-12-2018T21:09:51,Bgrmystr2,"It's been so long, I wouldn't recognise it even if that were the one I found, but I recall the one I did find rejected me"
11-12-2018T21:10:07,Twokinds,"So if you just had 5 million dollars, you could make 100,000 dollars a year."
11-12-2018T21:10:27,Twokinds,Just for having the money.
11-12-2018T21:10:42,Bgrmystr2,haha yes that sounds like a steal
11-12-2018T21:11:53,unsteddyphoenix,Wow juat 5mil?
11-12-2018T21:11:58,Bgrmystr2,"just go to the bank when noone's there, ""borrow"" $5m, put it in that account, then a year later, bring the money back to the bank again when noone's there."
11-12-2018T21:12:02,Bgrmystr2,Easy peasy
11-12-2018T21:12:05,unsteddyphoenix,Thats walking around money

11-12-2018T23:00:25,unsteddyphoenix,Disgraceful
11-12-2018T23:00:32,unsteddyphoenix,No.
11-12-2018T23:00:34,RimaDraws,no
11-12-2018T23:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I ordered some Walmart pickup stuff awhile ago - told me it’d be ready the 14th cause of delays. I also just came home from work
11-12-2018T23:00:35,unsteddyphoenix,But if we ever play~
11-12-2018T23:00:41,RimaDraws,how was i supposed to know
11-12-2018T23:00:44,Dadrobit,You know it unsteddy
11-12-2018T23:00:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess whose pickup email just came in
11-12-2018T23:01:20,Dadrobit,"""that got my brother in law"" That part was kind of a hint?"
11-12-2018T23:01:31,RimaDraws,i didn't read that
11-12-2018T23:01:50,RimaDraws,only saw what tom said
11-12-2018T23:01:55,RimaDraws,too tired to read everything
11-12-2018T23:02:04,unsteddyphoenix,Heh.
11-12-2018T23:02:11,Dadrobit,"But seriously, who the hell bets half their stack on pocket threes?!?!?"
11-12-2018T23:02:26,RimaDraws,people who can bluff
11-12-2018T23:02:27,unsteddyphoenix,Dude pocket 3's isnt that bad
11-12-2018T23:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom wants you to lose clothes
11-12-2018T23:02:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Apparently
11-12-2018T23:02:48,unsteddyphoenix,Thats like as good as KA suited imo
11-12-2018T23:03:06,RimaDraws,i dont know what a pocket of three's are
11-12-2018T23:03:42,CrRAR,"It's advantageous, the more clothes YOU lose the more Natani has to cuddle with."
11-12-2018T23:03:44,Dadrobit,"Pairs are super common, 3's are a helluva gamble, the only thing they beat are pair of two and high card."
11-12-2018T23:04:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Its when you start the game with your two cards being 3s, so you have a (weak) pair in your hand right from the get go"
11-12-2018T23:04:02,RimaDraws,oh
11-12-2018T23:04:10,unsteddyphoenix,True Cr!
11-12-2018T23:04:12,Dadrobit,Pocket threes is that the initial cards you are dealt are a pair of threes.
11-12-2018T23:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Play strip poker on date. Move on to messy twister
11-12-2018T23:04:24,RimaDraws,so they bluffed you with a pocket of three's
11-12-2018T23:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,What happens happens
11-12-2018T23:04:26,unsteddyphoenix,A lot of the time noone makes a pair though.
11-12-2018T23:04:40,unsteddyphoenix,"They go in with like, two high cards and get nothin/"
11-12-2018T23:05:13,unsteddyphoenix,then your trees beat their king high or w/e

11-12-2018T23:05:29,unsteddyphoenix,^
11-12-2018T23:05:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s too late for math
11-12-2018T23:05:40,CrRAR,tru
11-12-2018T23:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes sense three trees beat a king. Just one hitting you hurts enough
11-12-2018T23:06:44,Dadrobit,"It's nearly a 50/50 that someone gets a pair, and I had a pocket pair of Kings. Next best is Pair of aces, or two of a kind, which drops the probabiliy to under 10%. Shit's unlikely at that point."
11-12-2018T23:07:47,Bgrmystr2,haha kiwi well played
11-12-2018T23:07:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yeah, no, you got screwed"
11-12-2018T23:08:04,unsteddyphoenix,"But i'd go in on 3's, probably"
11-12-2018T23:08:12,unsteddyphoenix,I'd just lose 'cause im not that lucky~
11-12-2018T23:08:52,Dadrobit,lol
11-12-2018T23:11:36,Dadrobit,"S'what I get for playing like I do. Moderately aggro early game to knock out some folks, swap to conservative and calculated mid to late game. I got dunked on this time though."
11-12-2018T23:12:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh, interesting. I do the opposite."
11-12-2018T23:12:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Conservative to wait for people to get out, then aggressive near the end."
11-12-2018T23:13:16,Dadrobit,Usually gets me into the final hands of the game. Though I've only won the pot once.
11-12-2018T23:14:25,Dadrobit,"My other brother in law plays legit poker, so while I've gotten better, his game knowledge still beats me (and pretty much everyone else too) out."
11-12-2018T23:15:52,unsteddyphoenix,Study up and beat him! :O
11-12-2018T23:16:03,unsteddyphoenix,Read poker books I bet those exist
11-12-2018T23:16:10,Dadrobit,"And by conservative, I mean that I only bank on hands that I know are good, and for those hands I do go hard."
11-12-2018T23:17:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, youre not folding pocket aces"
11-12-2018T23:18:16,Dadrobit,"""But I thought Aced counted as only one?"""
11-12-2018T23:18:20,Dadrobit,Aces*
11-12-2018T23:18:51,unsteddyphoenix,"""No silly, its one OR eleven"""
