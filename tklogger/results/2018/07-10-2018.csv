07-10-2018T22:19:47,CrRAR,eyyy neighbor lol
07-10-2018T22:20:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though where I live, it could also be considered the 1920s"
07-10-2018T22:20:15,CommanderTrace,I live in Germany lol xD
07-10-2018T22:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just talking a peek in from Mark’s stream
07-10-2018T22:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,He told the story of being served live octopus and eating a chicken foot
07-10-2018T22:23:52,CommanderTrace,so it is a bit difficult to watch tom's livestreams because when he  streams its night for me
07-10-2018T22:24:28,CommanderTrace,ok lol
07-10-2018T22:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oddly enough, it’s not the weirdest thing he’s tried. And he said he passed on the octopus"
07-10-2018T22:33:42,CommanderTrace,and what's the strangest thing he's ever eaten?
07-10-2018T22:33:56,CommanderTrace,do you know that?
07-10-2018T22:35:32,SpazztasticKiwi,He said he’s tried a pig testicle
07-10-2018T22:36:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Which was a piece of information I personally don’t feel I really needed
07-10-2018T22:37:02,CommanderTrace,:joy: im too
07-10-2018T22:37:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I wonder if he needs someone to tell him to rein in the word vomit
07-10-2018T22:38:41,CommanderTrace,:joy:
07-10-2018T22:41:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"To be fair, I might would try a tiny TINY bit of live octopus"
07-10-2018T22:42:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"But my problem is I like my food dead. Dead dead. As in, if it is moving; if it is looking at me. I’m. Not. Fecking. Eating. It."
