29-12-2018T18:45:02,HobbitGames,You know your shizz
29-12-2018T18:45:24,Aphala,Clearly nat is using a black soul stone then
29-12-2018T18:45:29,Bgrmystr2,though Mekkan has a very different physics engine than Earth.exe so
29-12-2018T18:45:34,RimaDraws,wow i go to do dishes and i see wisecracks made
29-12-2018T18:45:43,Bgrmystr2,maybe magic is a thing that changes it.
29-12-2018T18:45:47,EggRollss,Hello everyone
29-12-2018T18:45:49,TerraTheWizard,"but ghosts traditionally glow, so would they cast a shadow :ctwokinds-floraquestion:"

29-12-2018T18:46:05,Bgrmystr2,disgoosting
29-12-2018T18:46:05,CrimsonQuill,"I wash dishes, thank you very much."
29-12-2018T18:46:19,CrimsonQuill,Someone has to wash the stuff that isn't dishwasher safe.
29-12-2018T18:46:21,HobbitGames,Im crimson far ye
29-12-2018T18:46:22,Mippy,It’s pretty common to do dishes
29-12-2018T18:46:23,ThingsAreMoving,"Laura is in a different plane of existance, that apparently includes shadows"
29-12-2018T18:46:25,CrimsonQuill,And that someone is me.
29-12-2018T18:46:28,Aphala,All those old lady ceramics
29-12-2018T18:46:34,Bgrmystr2,"why would you buy stuff that isn't dishwasher safe, Quill?"
29-12-2018T18:46:35,Aphala,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
29-12-2018T18:46:37,Bgrmystr2,that's the first problem
29-12-2018T18:46:47,HobbitGames,(That is a slightly different version of a common irish sayibg(
29-12-2018T18:47:03,HobbitGames,))
29-12-2018T18:47:07,Aphala,I mean a washing machine is just a more unsafe dishwasher
29-12-2018T18:47:09,Aphala,Try it
29-12-2018T18:47:15,HobbitGames,Hahaha aphal
29-12-2018T18:47:16,HobbitGames,A
29-12-2018T18:47:20,Bgrmystr2,Aphala nooo
29-12-2018T18:47:23,CrimsonQuill,"@Bgrmystr2 Because sometimes it's nice to have good crockery, and also you can'd dishwash a porcelyn teapot, or Nicholas Mosse."
29-12-2018T18:47:36,Bgrmystr2,then get one that you can.
29-12-2018T18:47:39,CrimsonQuill,Nope
29-12-2018T18:47:41,CrimsonQuill,Denied
29-12-2018T18:47:51,Bgrmystr2,"hey, you're the one that has to do the dishes"
29-12-2018T18:48:03,CrimsonQuill,"Anyhow, dishwashing glass does pit and cloud it over time."
29-12-2018T18:48:05,Bgrmystr2,no complaining if you won't even get somethin that's similar but also dishwasher safe.
29-12-2018T18:48:07,CrimsonQuill,Something in the tablets.
29-12-2018T18:48:20,Mippy,Besides if it’s only two people eating there is no point in using the dishwasher. Waste of water and water bills are expensive
29-12-2018T18:48:27,Aphala,Tenacious D will always be timeless
29-12-2018T18:48:30,Bgrmystr2,and that's a bad brand of dishwashing soap lol
29-12-2018T18:48:36,Katfeathers,over here I'd need a dishwashing machine for that to be relevent
29-12-2018T18:48:40,CrimsonQuill,"Not to mention, some stuff just HAS to be handwashed due to the stubborness of the stains."
29-12-2018T18:48:51,Bgrmystr2,"Mippy, spend a week here at my house and you'll see differently"
29-12-2018T18:48:54,CrimsonQuill,"We mostly use the dishwasher, yes"
29-12-2018T18:49:01,CrimsonQuill,But some stuff HAS to be handwashed.
29-12-2018T18:49:07,CrimsonQuill,And it's all the better for it.
29-12-2018T18:49:20,CrimsonQuill,yawns.
29-12-2018T18:49:32,Bgrmystr2,"gotta get quality detergent that gets rid of all of it, yo"
29-12-2018T18:49:43,Aphala,:ctwokinds-flomad:
29-12-2018T18:49:49,ThingsAreMoving,soak it up for two hours
29-12-2018T18:49:57,ThingsAreMoving,no need for lots of scrubbing
29-12-2018T18:49:59,Bgrmystr2,soaking can help too
29-12-2018T18:50:02,HobbitGames,Im bopping hard rn
29-12-2018T18:50:08,CrimsonQuill,@ThingsAreMoving  Scrubbing AND soaking's faster.
29-12-2018T18:50:13,unsteddyphoenix,Just lick your plates clean
29-12-2018T18:50:16,CrimsonQuill,NO
29-12-2018T18:50:16,ThingsAreMoving,^
29-12-2018T18:50:18,Aphala,Just live like a true mad lad and just use paper plates
29-12-2018T18:50:22,ThingsAreMoving,unfteddy gets it
29-12-2018T18:50:22,unsteddyphoenix,You get the bonus of flavour
29-12-2018T18:50:28,RimaDraws,talkin about cleaning dishes?
29-12-2018T18:50:32,CrimsonQuill,Yes
29-12-2018T18:50:37,Bgrmystr2,"that requires you spending time cleaning them when you could be doing more important things, Quill"
29-12-2018T18:50:39,RimaDraws,want me to do them?
29-12-2018T18:50:44,unsteddyphoenix,Laura talking about being more assertive...
29-12-2018T18:50:47,CrimsonQuill,"Such as, Bgr?"
29-12-2018T18:50:57,HobbitGames,You could write a book?
29-12-2018T18:51:02,ThingsAreMoving,"You WANT to do the dishes, Rima?"
29-12-2018T18:51:12,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know, making money? Enjoying a hobby? Taking a break from work?"
29-12-2018T18:51:14,RimaDraws,well it don't bother me
29-12-2018T18:51:17,ProsePro7,Hey quick question.  In universe how long has it been since the TK comic started?  A year right?
29-12-2018T18:51:19,HobbitGames,Maybe invent something that could revolutionise the world as we know it
29-12-2018T18:51:30,CrimsonQuill,"Someone has to clean stuff up, mate."
29-12-2018T18:51:39,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah Quill, We call it a dishwasher :V"
29-12-2018T18:51:44,CrimsonQuill,"It isn't pretty, but SOMEONE has to do it."
29-12-2018T18:51:44,Bgrmystr2,and they work
29-12-2018T18:51:44,unsteddyphoenix,Few months I believe
29-12-2018T18:51:46,Katfeathers,Personally I'm tired of those who think they should just leave their dishis for someone else to clean
29-12-2018T18:51:47,RimaDraws,i dont have one
29-12-2018T18:51:51,CrimsonQuill,And that SOMEONE is me.
29-12-2018T18:51:55,ThingsAreMoving,"heck, to be honest I'd rather do the dishes than vacuum the house"
29-12-2018T18:51:58,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe half a year at most I dont quite remember
29-12-2018T18:52:05,RimaDraws,i love vacuuming
29-12-2018T18:52:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah dishes arent the worst
29-12-2018T18:52:06,CatzArt,At my old college the school took our dishwashers because the beef and chicken science majors were washing their farm clothes in them.
29-12-2018T18:52:08,Bgrmystr2,You're an electric machine that washes dishes?
29-12-2018T18:52:08,Mippy,I like doing the dishes if it gets me out of serving customers
29-12-2018T18:52:12,HobbitGames,"I have my slav---- servants to do that for me. Yeah, i live the classic Irish lifestyle."
29-12-2018T18:52:14,ProsePro7,Yeah half year sounds right
29-12-2018T18:52:18,unsteddyphoenix,Love vaccuuming...

29-12-2018T19:25:08,Apostrophe,My elementary/middle/high school used all metric/SI units for science courses. Then I got to undergrad and they insisted on using imperial for some reason. I had a tough time re-learning everything. So much dirtier formulae.

29-12-2018T20:46:37,Dadrobit,Reni is something like 20? Seems their youth is likely akin to that of a human?
29-12-2018T20:47:00,Dadrobit,"Just, ya know, bigger faster."
29-12-2018T20:47:19,Dadrobit,Unless the eggs are house sized.
29-12-2018T20:48:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,one egg can feed entire family for generation
29-12-2018T20:49:19,Dadrobit,An omelette to remember.

29-12-2018T20:51:27,unsteddyphoenix,20 is fairly adult by our standards

29-12-2018T20:51:45,Dadrobit,"Reni is called ""young one"" by Nora. But that's about it for hard facts on the matter."
29-12-2018T20:52:41,qwe304,if we are lucky tom may tell us
29-12-2018T20:53:28,Dadrobit,"And that her rank is ""near the very bottom"" by dragon standards."
29-12-2018T20:54:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Was there a thing about ""pure"" dragons and ""impure"" dragons?"
29-12-2018T20:54:51,unsteddyphoenix,Or am I getting fantasies confused
29-12-2018T20:55:15,Xexanoth,there was not
29-12-2018T20:55:48,Dadrobit,I think that was an impromptu factoid from Tom after a stream concerning the offspring of dragons with other creatures like humans.
29-12-2018T20:55:59,unsteddyphoenix,Curses. I thought there was dragons that mated with dragons or drgons with other humanoids
29-12-2018T20:56:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, yeah cool. So it was twokinds"
29-12-2018T20:56:22,Dadrobit,"And Reni was one of them, therefore she is not immortal."
29-12-2018T20:56:52,unsteddyphoenix,"But Nora is, I believe"
29-12-2018T20:57:25,Dadrobit,Yes.

29-12-2018T21:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh Tom - have you seen the spirit squirrel again?
29-12-2018T21:58:25,Twokinds,I haven't had an opprtunity to go looking.
29-12-2018T22:01:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah
29-12-2018T22:02:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably curled in a ball of fluff in its best anyway

29-12-2018T22:18:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Not many white materials to make a pure white nest
29-12-2018T22:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Not too sure the lil one is into such an aesthetic either - the goal is to blend in
29-12-2018T22:33:21,Dadrobit,Oof. So I'm on my folks' family plan and they decided to switch from Verizon to T-Mobile today. The plan is for unlimited everything for $25 a month. Down from Verizon's $40.
29-12-2018T22:33:43,Dadrobit,But I just got my phone back an it's not looking great.
29-12-2018T22:34:20,Dadrobit,One bar of service. Apps are taking loading breaks for everything I do. And YouTube is struggling to even hit 360p.
29-12-2018T22:35:03,Dadrobit,"If this persists and the family decides to stay, I might be getting my own plan methinks."
29-12-2018T22:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Smoke signals
29-12-2018T22:35:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Cheaper
29-12-2018T22:36:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok I think I’m gonna go ahead n get some more soup 🍲
29-12-2018T22:38:05,Dadrobit,:( It keeps on swapping back to 240p.... All I want to do is watch AntsCanada from the comfort of my own bed...
29-12-2018T22:38:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Internet thinks not it seems
29-12-2018T22:41:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I have three apps open including here and YouTube and it’s all playing fine
29-12-2018T22:41:29,SpazztasticKiwi,And I live out in Fifiknowsville
29-12-2018T22:42:28,Dadrobit,And I live just outside of one of the largest cities in the US. Still only one bar of service.
29-12-2018T22:43:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah the modern world
29-12-2018T22:45:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Hot soup is in fact hot. And attracts hungry kitty

29-12-2018T23:44:26,SpazztasticKiwi,...technically yeah
29-12-2018T23:45:09,SpazztasticKiwi,All our hams are “gluten” free as far as we’re informed. And all ham can be glutton free if you can control yourself
29-12-2018T23:45:54,SpazztasticKiwi,And very oddly enough that reminds me - did your dryer get over its tantrum?
29-12-2018T23:56:36,Twokinds,It's just old
29-12-2018T23:58:11,RimaDraws,lol
29-12-2018T23:59:56,SpazztasticKiwi,So it was a fit of alzheimer’s
