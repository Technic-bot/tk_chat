20-08-2018T00:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Some ghost curse just showed up in my game. It‚Äôs level 100 but isn‚Äôt doing damage
20-08-2018T00:17:36,Ordithus,"goku, cool cool"

20-08-2018T00:18:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Fate: The Cursed King
20-08-2018T00:20:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Ding dong the ghost is dead
20-08-2018T00:20:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Or - deadER
20-08-2018T00:20:56,Ordithus,Double dead
20-08-2018T00:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,You know that moment in a game where you come across a new enemy and you just ‚Äúwhat kind of abomination are you?‚Äù
20-08-2018T00:23:03,SpazztasticKiwi,This game is kinda full of that except old
20-08-2018T00:28:52,Ordithus,"Usually I expect the new enemy to be incredibly dangerous, and I go crazy.  This always ends with a nuke-the-puppy situation"
20-08-2018T00:29:15,Ordithus,"Anyways, night! :ctwokinds-natanisleep:"
20-08-2018T00:51:23,DarthRexKing,I am going to sleep too. Bye!
20-08-2018T00:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,K night guys
20-08-2018T00:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be done after one more level
20-08-2018T00:57:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Totally just one more
20-08-2018T01:47:04,Twokinds,...
20-08-2018T01:47:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear
20-08-2018T01:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I only went from dungeon level 11 to level 30
20-08-2018T01:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Night‚Äôs still young. One more
20-08-2018T01:50:10,Twokinds,lol
20-08-2018T01:50:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve played this game enough and it should be way too boring now but damn it I‚Äôll still play
20-08-2018T01:55:12,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, still not done eh"
20-08-2018T02:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,To be fair I‚Äôm passing time with YouTube videos in the background
20-08-2018T02:03:41,unsteddyphoenix,I feel that. Ive been doing the same divinity fight for like
20-08-2018T02:03:44,unsteddyphoenix,Approaching an hour
20-08-2018T02:04:11,unsteddyphoenix,Its a hard knock life
20-08-2018T02:04:41,SpazztasticKiwi,If I could find this merchant guy being held captive on this dungeon level my life could go on
20-08-2018T02:04:42,Bgrmystr2,"lol that was more aimed at tom than you kiwi, but noone's ever truely done"
20-08-2018T02:05:21,unsteddyphoenix,If these damn AI would stop killing my friendly NPC I could actually finish this fight
20-08-2018T02:06:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw why you hate the AI? They‚Äôre supposed to make your life difficult
20-08-2018T02:07:20,unsteddyphoenix,"They should be hitting me, the THREAT"
20-08-2018T02:07:31,unsteddyphoenix,Instead theyre pummeling a defenseless old man cowering on the floor
20-08-2018T02:07:34,unsteddyphoenix,Just to SPITE me
20-08-2018T02:07:55,unsteddyphoenix,There's evil and then there's just rude
20-08-2018T02:08:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe they don‚Äôt consider you worth their time
20-08-2018T02:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,#rude
20-08-2018T02:08:17,unsteddyphoenix,WHAT
20-08-2018T02:08:22,unsteddyphoenix,How DARE they think that
20-08-2018T02:08:26,Bgrmystr2,or perhaps they know that you're too much of an opponent
20-08-2018T02:08:33,Bgrmystr2,and they have to take out the weakest first
20-08-2018T02:08:38,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if they fight you, they lose."
20-08-2018T02:08:44,Bgrmystr2,but if they kill the old man with you
20-08-2018T02:08:52,Bgrmystr2,"even if they lose, you lose too"
20-08-2018T02:08:53,Bgrmystr2,..probably
20-08-2018T02:09:00,Bgrmystr2,"or so is their thought process, maybe"
20-08-2018T02:09:15,unsteddyphoenix,"""I'll win a fight against ANYBODY that doesnt fight"" -them"
20-08-2018T02:09:25,unsteddyphoenix,They know if they kill him i'll just reload
20-08-2018T02:09:29,unsteddyphoenix,Prolonging their lifespan
20-08-2018T02:09:31,unsteddyphoenix,My god
20-08-2018T02:09:35,Bgrmystr2,yes exactly
20-08-2018T02:09:35,unsteddyphoenix,This is true advanced AI
20-08-2018T02:09:45,Bgrmystr2,they know you gtfo if the guy dies
20-08-2018T02:09:55,Bgrmystr2,and they know they die if they attack you
20-08-2018T02:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,My situation is I‚Äôve finally found the captive guy but I gotta rescue him
20-08-2018T02:10:05,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, the old dude is the obvious choice."
20-08-2018T02:10:10,unsteddyphoenix,ah the ol' escort mission
20-08-2018T02:10:26,unsteddyphoenix,See I would think the ones that are going to kill me is the obvious choice
20-08-2018T02:10:40,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, attacking the old dude doesn't make em any less dicks cuz he's the strategically better choice, but yknow."
20-08-2018T02:10:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But the Djin that has him keeps running around and summoning imps that get in my way
20-08-2018T02:10:47,Bgrmystr2,least they're smart dicks.
20-08-2018T02:11:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Get over here and fight me you glorified genie
20-08-2018T02:11:49,unsteddyphoenix,There need to be more games that let you just
20-08-2018T02:11:53,unsteddyphoenix,goad your enemy into fighting you
20-08-2018T02:12:29,unsteddyphoenix,Get me a protagonist that knows taunt
20-08-2018T02:12:41,Bgrmystr2,Well.. the barbarian in Diablo 2 knew taunt.
20-08-2018T02:12:46,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
20-08-2018T02:12:49,Bgrmystr2,that's one game.
20-08-2018T02:13:31,Bgrmystr2,I don't think he's gonna help you though
20-08-2018T02:13:35,Xexanoth,there's a simple solution to your problem
20-08-2018T02:13:37,Bgrmystr2,in a game that's specifically not diablo 2
20-08-2018T02:13:43,Xexanoth,step 1: Git Gud! XD
20-08-2018T02:14:16,unsteddyphoenix,first of all how dare you
20-08-2018T02:15:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm perfectly skilled thank you it‚Äôs the big chicken enemy playing run away that‚Äôs the problem
20-08-2018T02:15:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm he just died
20-08-2018T02:15:50,Xexanoth,pls tell me he died because he ran into some natural damage source
20-08-2018T02:17:16,unsteddyphoenix,"ran into a wall, calling it"
20-08-2018T02:17:26,SpazztasticKiwi,No I kept chasing him with my summoned Valkyrie
20-08-2018T02:17:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"If he want to play ‚Äúcall mom‚Äù, so can i"
20-08-2018T02:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I did eventually corner him
20-08-2018T02:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Any better luck Steddy?
20-08-2018T02:27:13,unsteddyphoenix,Im having a good run this time
20-08-2018T02:27:32,unsteddyphoenix,Granted by abusing arrows that just keep some knocked down while I kill the rest
20-08-2018T02:27:46,unsteddyphoenix,But if theyre playing dirty SO AM I
20-08-2018T02:27:48,Twokinds,Okay
20-08-2018T02:27:55,Twokinds,I think I'm finally done with the text on this thing
20-08-2018T02:28:13,unsteddyphoenix,:clap::clap::clap: oo congrats
20-08-2018T02:28:29,unsteddyphoenix,Hey look we're all succeeding at the same time
20-08-2018T02:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªyay for you both! Progress is good stuff
20-08-2018T02:31:58,unsteddyphoenix,are you gonna upload today or tomorrow?
20-08-2018T02:32:05,Xexanoth,isn't knockdown the standard tactic of Divinity?
20-08-2018T02:32:32,unsteddyphoenix,there's a lot of tactics~
20-08-2018T02:32:43,unsteddyphoenix,I always thought knockdown arrows were busted
20-08-2018T02:32:47,unsteddyphoenix,oo and charm arrows
20-08-2018T02:33:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve decided to hang it up and put it down. The game anyway. Might scroll around more on YouTube, watch some DeFranco, listen to music, idk"
20-08-2018T02:34:17,unsteddyphoenix,But hey. You killed it. Nice work.
20-08-2018T02:34:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah, but that Djin wasn‚Äôt the big bad of the game. He was a sub boss"
20-08-2018T02:35:34,unsteddyphoenix,Still!
20-08-2018T02:35:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Progress is progress. Slow n steady
20-08-2018T02:37:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh yeah Tom, speaking of comic text, did you ever find out the problem with the previous page?"
20-08-2018T02:42:03,Twokinds,?
20-08-2018T02:42:24,Bgrmystr2,was there a problem with the previous page..?
20-08-2018T02:45:56,unsteddyphoenix,The thing with the transcript or something?
20-08-2018T02:46:55,Twokinds,OH yeah
20-08-2018T02:47:02,Twokinds,"Turns out, it was a weird problem with the text"
20-08-2018T02:47:16,Twokinds,It was using some other version of ' and ... characters
20-08-2018T02:47:22,Twokinds,And that was breaking the script
20-08-2018T02:47:35,Bgrmystr2,oh yeah I remember what's his name was making a note of it in the servers on discord
20-08-2018T02:47:58,Bgrmystr2,the guy who admins the site and stuff
20-08-2018T02:48:09,SpazztasticKiwi,At least it finally got figured out üëçüèª
20-08-2018T02:48:19,Bgrmystr2,"I can never remember his name off the top my head, I feel bad for him :("
20-08-2018T02:48:40,Twokinds,Tur
20-08-2018T02:49:14,Bgrmystr2,yeah! Turaiel
20-08-2018T02:49:18,Bgrmystr2,that's him
20-08-2018T02:49:23,Bgrmystr2,thanks lol
20-08-2018T02:50:50,shamdow,"just a quick question, when are the new books shipping?"
20-08-2018T02:50:58,unsteddyphoenix,NEVER
20-08-2018T02:51:03,Bgrmystr2,lolo
20-08-2018T02:53:03,Twokinds,I'll ask keepspot to send out an update to everyone
20-08-2018T02:53:19,shamdow,thanks! :)
20-08-2018T02:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been told about September
20-08-2018T02:53:31,SpazztasticKiwi,If not late this month
20-08-2018T02:53:44,unsteddyphoenix,thats probably a good idea yeah
20-08-2018T02:54:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Also got a JSE pin shipping in September too
20-08-2018T02:55:07,shamdow,jse?
20-08-2018T02:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Jacksepticeye
20-08-2018T02:55:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"For a donation to St. Jude‚Äôs, you got a pin"
20-08-2018T02:56:01,shamdow,"oh, nice."
20-08-2018T02:57:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"As if I don‚Äôt have enough posters, shirts, and pins as it is"
20-08-2018T02:58:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Just. One. More.
20-08-2018T03:01:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though since alot of it is because they were charity related, it‚Äôs very worth it"
20-08-2018T03:32:04,Twokinds,Comic is uploading...
20-08-2018T03:33:24,unsteddyphoenix,:ptv-excited:
20-08-2018T03:33:43,Bgrmystr2,noice
20-08-2018T03:34:24,unsteddyphoenix,Oh my god Natani
20-08-2018T03:34:51,unsteddyphoenix,:OOOO
20-08-2018T03:34:52,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy: MMMMMM NATANI
20-08-2018T03:35:14,unsteddyphoenix,It's gonna happppeeennn~ !!!!
20-08-2018T03:36:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Also Zen is like...wow, I can see how he's influenced Nat"
20-08-2018T03:36:32,unsteddyphoenix,"'Anything frilly = girly = bad' -Zen, maybe"
20-08-2018T03:36:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah
20-08-2018T03:36:52,Bgrmystr2,that's likely where Natani gets it from
20-08-2018T03:37:19,Bgrmystr2,"so it's not really Natani's thoughts on it, but just an overlap of Zen that Natani has taken as their own"
20-08-2018T03:37:28,Bgrmystr2,"or at least, tis how I'd see it"
20-08-2018T03:38:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea
20-08-2018T03:39:15,unsteddyphoenix,"And they both still seem to consider ""being a girl"" and ""liking girly things"" to be the same."
20-08-2018T03:39:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Despite, y'know, King Adelaide existing"
20-08-2018T03:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Shhhhhh. You‚Äôre not supposed to notice that
20-08-2018T03:49:43,Bgrmystr2,"Natani has always been a tomboy, from her younger mental self"
20-08-2018T03:50:09,Bgrmystr2,"and there's nothin wrong with girls liking things that guys usually like, and you don't even gotta be a tomboy for that"
20-08-2018T03:50:19,Bgrmystr2,just happens to be more common
20-08-2018T03:50:54,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed
20-08-2018T03:51:14,Bgrmystr2,"so I mean.. I dunno, I don't think there's anything natani has to worry about. You can still be a girl while being a fuckin manlyman and one of the strongest motherfuckers in the group"
20-08-2018T03:51:38,Bgrmystr2,there's nothin wrong with that at all
20-08-2018T03:51:56,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what IM sayin'. I wouldve hoped Adelaide wouldve proved that to her
20-08-2018T03:51:59,Bgrmystr2,Bugger all she feels the need to hide it. :/
20-08-2018T03:52:04,unsteddyphoenix,But it seems not yet~
20-08-2018T03:52:06,Bgrmystr2,"yeah same, phoenix"
20-08-2018T03:52:12,Bgrmystr2,I think it's slowly creeping in though
20-08-2018T03:52:19,Bgrmystr2,maybe it took time to sink in
20-08-2018T03:52:20,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
20-08-2018T03:52:35,unsteddyphoenix,And then Zen comes in and sets it all in a different direction
20-08-2018T03:52:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Poor Natani, perpetually confused wolf"
20-08-2018T03:52:52,Bgrmystr2,the guy throwin wrenches :wrench:
20-08-2018T03:53:03,unsteddyphoenix,seriously
20-08-2018T03:53:23,Bgrmystr2,"can't even fault the dude for misleading Natani, cuz that's probably all he's ever seen"
20-08-2018T03:53:40,Bgrmystr2,so he doesn't even realize that girls can be just as manly as guys can
20-08-2018T03:53:49,Bgrmystr2,"like, it's not even a thing maybe?"
20-08-2018T03:53:53,Bgrmystr2,I dunno
20-08-2018T03:54:30,Bgrmystr2,"and now natanis buff as shit, she could prolly take zen on physically, if they weren't injured or whatever"
20-08-2018T03:54:50,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah wolves are a very male-focused culture from what I understand
20-08-2018T03:54:59,unsteddyphoenix,Actual patriarchy
20-08-2018T03:55:09,Bgrmystr2,"so I mean, being physically a girl hasn't stopped her from being probably just as strong as zen is"
20-08-2018T03:55:29,Bgrmystr2,and has the sex appeal thing to use against enemies to boot..
20-08-2018T03:55:36,Bgrmystr2,not that it'd work against him but yknow.
20-08-2018T03:55:48,Twokinds,certainly now that he's only got one leg haha
20-08-2018T03:55:52,Bgrmystr2,LOL tom pls
20-08-2018T03:55:58,unsteddyphoenix,Hey maybe Zen has the sex appeal thing too~
20-08-2018T03:56:06,Bgrmystr2,haha that is true
20-08-2018T03:56:29,unsteddyphoenix,Tom who would win in arm wrestling Zen or Natani
20-08-2018T03:56:35,unsteddyphoenix,This is the most important lore question
20-08-2018T03:56:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz I dunno if wolves have the whole 'men shouldn't hit women' thing like we do here
20-08-2018T03:56:54,Bgrmystr2,haha phoenix asking the real questions
20-08-2018T03:57:05,Twokinds,"Honestly, Zen, probably"
20-08-2018T03:57:24,unsteddyphoenix,"Mmm, yeah."
20-08-2018T03:57:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Genetics are a thing, even amongst wolves."
20-08-2018T03:57:52,unsteddyphoenix,If males are stronger then that might develop bgr yeah
20-08-2018T03:58:28,Twokinds,"Dogs at least do, since Evals in canon said that to Mike"
20-08-2018T03:59:14,unsteddyphoenix,Oh did he? I didnt remember.
20-08-2018T04:00:17,unsteddyphoenix,The only race that seems different are basitins
20-08-2018T04:00:47,unsteddyphoenix,Males are ever so shorter and stockier but it seems like a very minor difference?
20-08-2018T04:00:49,Twokinds,"Yeah he said he didn't want to hit him, because he was a girl."
20-08-2018T04:01:02,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh right.
20-08-2018T04:01:18,unsteddyphoenix,"And Evals was ""wild"" originally so he didnt get it from humans"
20-08-2018T04:01:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd figured that Nat wore her boobs tied cause they also could get in the way when fighting
20-08-2018T04:02:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Better range of motion
20-08-2018T04:02:28,unsteddyphoenix,well im sure that's a nice side benefit
20-08-2018T04:03:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"In cross dressing it‚Äôs useful if you‚Äôre aiming to commit to a full cross, but it helps arm movement greatly too"
20-08-2018T04:04:05,Twokinds,I didn't know about arm movement
20-08-2018T04:04:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well with as blessed Nat is, yeah"
20-08-2018T04:04:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Boobs get in the way sometimes
20-08-2018T04:04:47,unsteddyphoenix,So women with big breasts have less...arm movement?
20-08-2018T04:04:50,unsteddyphoenix,That's a thing?
20-08-2018T04:04:56,SpazztasticKiwi,For her fighting
20-08-2018T04:05:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Try boxing with two ten pound weights on your chest
20-08-2018T04:05:18,SpazztasticKiwi,See how far you get
20-08-2018T04:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And you bump into shit all the time. Air bags without air
20-08-2018T04:06:45,unsteddyphoenix,Well obviously I know theyd be inconvinient
20-08-2018T04:07:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Just, less range of motion with your arms?"
20-08-2018T04:07:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Shrug, I guess?"
20-08-2018T04:08:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"It depends on the woman. Yes she‚Äôs got a nice size, but she could also train with that so it doesn‚Äôt cause problems"
20-08-2018T04:09:03,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs also why sports bras exist. To keep everything in place and to prevent pain from them moving around from exercise
20-08-2018T04:09:09,SpazztasticKiwi,As tmi as that is
20-08-2018T04:09:34,unsteddyphoenix,They really need to come out with pocket dimension bras already
20-08-2018T04:09:39,unsteddyphoenix,infinitely more versitile
20-08-2018T04:09:48,Twokinds,Yes very handy
20-08-2018T04:10:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"I figured this was one of the reasons Tom had Nat use binders. Yes because of the she is a He thing, but also cause boobs are a pain in the ass sometimes, let alone when you‚Äôre an Assassin"
20-08-2018T04:11:46,SpazztasticKiwi,But yes. Pocket bras would be beautiful
20-08-2018T04:12:04,unsteddyphoenix,But I bet Natani bound her...assets even when she was still growing
20-08-2018T04:12:22,unsteddyphoenix,"And they just, didnt stop~"
20-08-2018T04:12:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially since women‚Äôs pants with logical pockets don‚Äôt bloody exist apparently
20-08-2018T04:12:48,Bgrmystr2,"lol, I was gonna say somethin about sports bras, but I just got back now and yeah you hit the nail on the head there"
20-08-2018T04:13:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, that's a weird thing. I vaguely remember there's a reason womens pants dont have pockets but I forget"
20-08-2018T04:13:23,unsteddyphoenix,"But hey, at least you get to have handbags"
20-08-2018T04:13:26,Bgrmystr2,"cuz they help keep em still so it doesn't throw you off balance, that extra weight gotta be taken into account"
20-08-2018T04:13:58,Bgrmystr2,also weight in general..
20-08-2018T04:14:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Not to mention after moving around awhile your chest is like ‚Äúfor the love of God stop the momentum!‚Äù
20-08-2018T04:14:22,Bgrmystr2,I never did understand why women's pants don't have pockets like men's do. it's just dumb to me
20-08-2018T04:14:36,SpazztasticKiwi,So they can sell us handbags
20-08-2018T04:14:57,Bgrmystr2,"yeah just get men's pants with pockets and wear those, honestly.. :/"
20-08-2018T04:15:10,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it'd prolly be cheaper than pants + handbag
20-08-2018T04:15:21,Bgrmystr2,and someone can steal a handbag. they can't steal your pants.
20-08-2018T04:15:35,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, unless you take em off, then I'd question wot you'd be doin anyway :ptv-ohmy:"
20-08-2018T04:15:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I spend alot of time in the men‚Äôs department. Pants with pockets, shirts that don‚Äôt go to your belly button or show half your back..."
20-08-2018T04:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs great
20-08-2018T04:16:09,Bgrmystr2,right
20-08-2018T04:16:18,Bgrmystr2,I just wish it was like that for everyone
20-08-2018T04:16:18,unsteddyphoenix,No there IS a reason that's somewhat valid
20-08-2018T04:16:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Got a shirt the other day from over there
20-08-2018T04:16:28,Bgrmystr2,well yeah if they're YOU phoenix
20-08-2018T04:16:29,unsteddyphoenix,Something about womens figures and pockets
20-08-2018T04:16:45,Bgrmystr2,"If everyone was phoenix, noone would wear pants outside"
20-08-2018T04:16:50,Bgrmystr2,then we'd all be using handbags
20-08-2018T04:17:09,Bgrmystr2,though at that point.. that would also be equality... :thinking:
20-08-2018T04:17:23,unsteddyphoenix,Handbags are great
20-08-2018T04:17:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah the shirt thing is because boobs mean there‚Äôs got to be a shape in the chest part of the shirt to accommodate a bra and boobs
20-08-2018T04:17:43,Bgrmystr2,yeah but who puts pants on their boobs? lolol
20-08-2018T04:17:50,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. I'm sure SOME people
20-08-2018T04:17:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Though, you could always just buy mens pants"
20-08-2018T04:17:54,Bgrmystr2,but.. really
20-08-2018T04:18:06,unsteddyphoenix,Since women pretty much look good in anything
20-08-2018T04:18:39,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, phoenix, I think men would probably look good in anything to women as well"
20-08-2018T04:18:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Men‚Äôs jeans don‚Äôt usually fit me but I like the sweatpants stuff more anyway
20-08-2018T04:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,This just became Fashion Channel
20-08-2018T04:18:57,Bgrmystr2,"are they too big, kiwi?"
20-08-2018T04:19:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Too tall most of the time
20-08-2018T04:19:20,Bgrmystr2,ooh
20-08-2018T04:19:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah that makes sense
20-08-2018T04:19:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And too much waist room
20-08-2018T04:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Thigh room is great though
20-08-2018T04:19:41,Bgrmystr2,"you can always do what my mom did and roll up the bottom, hem them up"
20-08-2018T04:19:49,Bgrmystr2,she did that all the time
20-08-2018T04:20:05,Bgrmystr2,even did some sewing a few times so she didn't have to hem too much
20-08-2018T04:20:10,unsteddyphoenix,Just get boys pants! :D
20-08-2018T04:20:15,Bgrmystr2,XD phoenix
20-08-2018T04:20:47,unsteddyphoenix,"My dad would always buy baggy jeans, then take them to a local lady and she'd tailor them into skinny jeans"
20-08-2018T04:20:51,unsteddyphoenix,Saved $$$
20-08-2018T04:21:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Shopping in the men‚Äôs areas of stores often comes out to be cheaper and more comfortable but you can‚Äôt find dresses over there
20-08-2018T04:21:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah men don't usually wear dresses.
20-08-2018T04:21:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And dresses never have pockets
20-08-2018T04:21:41,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah :/
20-08-2018T04:21:50,Bgrmystr2,Should I ever wear a dress.
20-08-2018T04:21:57,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna get one with pockets.
20-08-2018T04:21:59,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:U
20-08-2018T04:22:06,Bgrmystr2,fuck not having pockets.
20-08-2018T04:22:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Grab the unicorn sitting next to it while you‚Äôre at it
20-08-2018T04:22:26,Bgrmystr2,naw
20-08-2018T04:22:30,Bgrmystr2,don't need that
20-08-2018T04:22:35,Bgrmystr2,those don't exist in gensokyo anyway
20-08-2018T04:22:40,Bgrmystr2,"not yet, anyway"
20-08-2018T04:22:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone needs a unicorn
20-08-2018T04:22:48,Bgrmystr2,I don't
20-08-2018T04:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe a dragon
20-08-2018T04:23:15,Bgrmystr2,just need a broom and a normal witch hat that makes you feel extraordinary when you wear it.
20-08-2018T04:23:28,Bgrmystr2,t'is all I need
20-08-2018T04:23:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have a witch costume
20-08-2018T04:23:52,Bgrmystr2,it's prolly not the same one I'm thinking of :P
20-08-2018T04:24:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Can‚Äôt be. Wore this one to my school renaissance fair
20-08-2018T04:24:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And it still fits
20-08-2018T04:25:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Wig, hat, dress, and now I have the cat for the whole gimmick"
20-08-2018T04:28:17,unsteddyphoenix,"true, a black cat too"
20-08-2018T04:30:45,SpazztasticKiwi,We all learned a lil something new
20-08-2018T04:31:13,Bgrmystr2,"what does it look like, kiwi? Curious"
20-08-2018T04:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,If you think I have a picture you‚Äôre crazy
20-08-2018T04:31:44,Bgrmystr2,no no just the outfit
20-08-2018T04:31:45,Bgrmystr2,not you
20-08-2018T04:31:49,Bgrmystr2,xD
20-08-2018T04:31:59,Bgrmystr2,just like a general idea of what kind of witch outfit it was
20-08-2018T04:32:11,Bgrmystr2,like if there was an image on google similar to it or somethin..
20-08-2018T04:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs very vampire heiress with the long sleeves
20-08-2018T04:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda Morticia Addams look
20-08-2018T04:35:46,Bgrmystr2,oh
20-08-2018T04:35:53,Bgrmystr2,that's not very classic witch-like
20-08-2018T04:35:55,Bgrmystr2,:/
20-08-2018T04:39:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I made it witch like. It fit the theme
20-08-2018T04:41:39,SpazztasticKiwi,October is my month. I like the art in costuming and makeup
20-08-2018T04:44:15,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, just saw the latest page. Spicy."
20-08-2018T04:47:54,unsteddyphoenix,riight~?
20-08-2018T04:53:07,BadFoMo,"Sorry, I have to do it. Zen: Well, at least Keidran/Basitin hybrids arn't possable."
20-08-2018T04:53:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Panties. I like em
20-08-2018T04:54:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Though is Kat obsessed with lace or is that something she racks on to just add color
20-08-2018T04:54:21,SpazztasticKiwi,*tacks
20-08-2018T04:54:58,unsteddyphoenix,its probably a bit of her preference seeping through
20-08-2018T04:55:50,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúYou get lace and frilly. And YOU get lace and frilly. YOU ALL GET LACE AND FRILLY‚Äù
20-08-2018T04:56:24,SpazztasticKiwi,(Nobody tell her about thongs)
20-08-2018T04:57:29,Dadrobit,I'm pretty confident she'd know?
20-08-2018T04:57:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if you want to split hairs, they have technically slept together"
20-08-2018T04:57:49,unsteddyphoenix,assuming they exist
20-08-2018T04:58:05,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôve just kept it to sleeping
20-08-2018T04:58:13,Dadrobit,Why wouldn't they. They save on material! It's just efficient clothing!
20-08-2018T04:58:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôd work well with a tail
20-08-2018T04:59:30,unsteddyphoenix,"The most EFFICIENT way to save on clothing would be, not wearing clothes"
20-08-2018T04:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I also feel I must note it‚Äôs concerning how odd this conversation is and yet it‚Äôs also kinda normal
20-08-2018T04:59:44,unsteddyphoenix,So clearly humans? Not concerned with that~
20-08-2018T05:00:07,unsteddyphoenix,Youve really not been on the internet long enough huh.
20-08-2018T05:00:25,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúLet your body breathe - go naked!‚Äù
20-08-2018T05:00:47,unsteddyphoenix,Something something the emporers new clothes
20-08-2018T05:01:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm on the internet too much
20-08-2018T05:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs the problem
20-08-2018T05:02:29,Bgrmystr2,"trying to make a file in stepmania with that icebreaker song tom had on his stream, but the damned thing won't even recognise the music file. -_-"
20-08-2018T05:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Computer says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not music‚Äù?
20-08-2018T05:03:01,Bgrmystr2,"no, just stepmania"
20-08-2018T05:03:18,Bgrmystr2,"apparently, the 5th version of the game has some shitty problems with audio files"
20-08-2018T05:03:20,Bgrmystr2,dunno why
20-08-2018T05:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Stepmania: ‚ÄúYour taste is awful. I‚Äôm not doing this.‚Äù
20-08-2018T05:03:52,Bgrmystr2,"it can shit off and die if it thinks that, there's plenty worse songs it already loaded."
20-08-2018T05:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll listen to the same song on repeat for hours while closing to the point I‚Äôm sure my phone wants to cry

20-08-2018T14:27:47,CrimsonQuill,Comes of forgetting that it was poured out...
20-08-2018T14:28:10,CrimsonQuill,I love the new page by the way. Funny as ever.
20-08-2018T14:29:24,Twokinds,Thanks!

20-08-2018T14:31:15,CrimsonQuill,That's actually the same difference as an American friend I have...

20-08-2018T14:32:54,Twokinds,normal

20-08-2018T14:34:29,CrimsonQuill,How long does it take you to draw a single comic page?
20-08-2018T14:36:27,Twokinds,10 hours
20-08-2018T14:36:36,CrimsonQuill,Oh. Gosh.
20-08-2018T14:36:48,CrimsonQuill,I actually want to learn to draw...

20-08-2018T14:38:53,CrimsonQuill,I'll get there eventually.
20-08-2018T14:39:41,CrimsonQuill,Also-have you ever read the newspaper Comic Calvin and Hobbes? It's something my Dad introduced me to. Cool strip.
20-08-2018T14:44:10,Xexanoth,patience problem hmmm... don't give in to the dark side!
20-08-2018T14:45:03,CrimsonQuill,I might have done so already.
20-08-2018T14:45:48,CrimsonQuill,@Xexanoth Or I could be wibble-wobbling on the edge of either.

20-08-2018T18:27:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm just gonna go back to my chillin
20-08-2018T18:31:34,SpazztasticKiwi,And sketch storming
20-08-2018T19:53:15,Bgrmystr2,today's sketch post is :ptv-ohmy::ptv-excited: :heartpulse:
20-08-2018T20:00:45,unsteddyphoenix,:heartbeat::heartbeat::heartbeat::heartbeat::heartbeat::heartbeat::heartbeat:
20-08-2018T20:02:40,unsteddyphoenix,The touchups Tom did
20-08-2018T20:02:45,unsteddyphoenix,Amazing :ok_hand:
20-08-2018T20:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh no
20-08-2018T20:04:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Side boob and full butt
20-08-2018T20:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,My precious eyes!
20-08-2018T20:06:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Easy, breezy, beautiful UnCovered Girl"
20-08-2018T20:06:15,Dadrobit,Dat's Scandaous!
20-08-2018T20:11:02,unsteddyphoenix,#freethesideboob
20-08-2018T20:11:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well considering there‚Äôs obviously no bra, it is free technically. Just covered"
20-08-2018T20:19:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"If she leans to far over the stove, she may set those ruffles on fire then her boobs will really be hot"
20-08-2018T20:24:02,unsteddyphoenix,Oh goodness
20-08-2018T20:24:11,unsteddyphoenix,Better get her away from that then
20-08-2018T20:24:14,unsteddyphoenix,It's not safe~
20-08-2018T20:24:31,Bgrmystr2,"they're pretty hot already, so I'm not quite sure how her outfit isn't already on fire :fire:"
20-08-2018T20:24:41,Bgrmystr2,must be fireproof :v
20-08-2018T20:24:48,Bgrmystr2,we're probably safe.
20-08-2018T20:31:47,unsteddyphoenix,logical
20-08-2018T20:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs getting hot in there, but she‚Äôs already taken all her clothes off"
20-08-2018T20:42:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Paradoxically, it's becoming hotter"
20-08-2018T20:43:06,unsteddyphoenix,Lol that song was so silly
20-08-2018T20:44:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"With as many people who‚Äôd want to join her in the kitchen, cooking would be impossible, let alone safe cooking"
20-08-2018T20:44:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if anything other than cooking started, I‚Äôm out"
20-08-2018T20:51:49,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-snicker: Don't worry Kiwi, There's more than one oven in that kitchen."
20-08-2018T20:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And mine‚Äôs unplugged as far as that‚Äôs concerned
20-08-2018T20:54:50,SpazztasticKiwi,And Kay‚Äôs is technically defective
20-08-2018T20:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,*Kat‚Äôs
20-08-2018T20:55:15,Bgrmystr2,"Keidran Kat being technically defective, yes."
20-08-2018T20:55:32,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-08-2018T21:01:15,unsteddyphoenix,This went in an unexpected direction
20-08-2018T21:02:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"The direction of truth, you mean??"
20-08-2018T21:02:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Look! A Nibbly of distraction! :ctwokinds-nibsdance:

20-08-2018T21:05:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Also distraction #2: :ctwokinds-florajiggle:
20-08-2018T21:09:38,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•™
20-08-2018T21:17:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you think we could get a Nibbly sleeping emote?
20-08-2018T21:24:06,TorqueEmUp,I just want more Keidran Nibbly. :P
20-08-2018T21:24:39,TorqueEmUp,Tom draws the best anthro squirrels.
20-08-2018T21:25:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it‚Äôs literally his job
20-08-2018T21:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure hope he‚Äôs good at it
20-08-2018T21:48:40,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance: running an intercept on the distractions
20-08-2018T21:50:29,Ordithus,So &lt;3 human :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
20-08-2018T21:54:30,Twokinds,I am planning to do a short featuring anthro nibs
20-08-2018T21:55:10,Ordithus,Sythe is going to have a heart attack
20-08-2018T21:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
20-08-2018T21:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Cute incoming then
20-08-2018T21:56:00,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited: I like this
20-08-2018T21:56:42,Twokinds,It'll actually be part of a series of non-canon shorts called Magical Mishaps
20-08-2018T21:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
20-08-2018T21:57:07,Bgrmystr2,aw
20-08-2018T21:57:12,Bgrmystr2,non canon
20-08-2018T21:57:16,Bgrmystr2,still sounds fun
20-08-2018T21:57:22,Ordithus,the canon kind of non-canon?
20-08-2018T21:57:45,Bgrmystr2,"Btw tom, where did the bounce song go from your playlist? this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7dlT6VRsdw"
20-08-2018T21:57:52,SpazztasticKiwi,":ctwokinds-nibsdance: üé∂ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be a star, I‚Äôm gonna be a star..‚Äù üé∂"
20-08-2018T21:57:55,Bgrmystr2,I haven't heard it in a long time
20-08-2018T21:58:05,Twokinds,It's still there
20-08-2018T21:58:09,Twokinds,There's just a lot of songs now
20-08-2018T21:58:09,Bgrmystr2,ah okay
20-08-2018T21:58:44,Twokinds,And dumb new youtube playlists got rid of linear shuffle
20-08-2018T21:58:50,Bgrmystr2,just wanted to make sure. :/
20-08-2018T21:58:52,Ordithus,Magical mishaps... lots of antics then.
20-08-2018T21:59:00,Twokinds,"So now it just picks a song at random, rather than creating a shuffled playlist"
20-08-2018T21:59:06,SpazztasticKiwi,The old ‚ÄúI have 200+ songs in my playlist and I‚Äôm not getting rid of any of them‚Äù
20-08-2018T21:59:06,Twokinds,Meaning some songs play more than once
20-08-2018T21:59:30,Bgrmystr2,you can always get a downloader to get the video and play em off your drive with a media player
20-08-2018T21:59:43,SpazztasticKiwi,My playlist does a shuffle
20-08-2018T22:00:27,Twokinds,ugh
20-08-2018T22:00:33,Twokinds,downloading 200 songs doesn't sound fun
20-08-2018T22:00:57,Bgrmystr2,:/ yeah
20-08-2018T22:00:58,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs been over the course of some time
20-08-2018T22:01:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"And it‚Äôs actually 210, but I rounded"
20-08-2018T22:02:27,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I just kinda download the songs I like when I hear em, and put em in a playlist and just happen to end up with a couple hundred lol.."
20-08-2018T22:02:40,Bgrmystr2,but all at once is a bit daunting
20-08-2018T22:03:12,Ordithus,"If enough people complain, they may add the shuffle back"
20-08-2018T22:03:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs YouTube you‚Äôre getting them from, right?"
20-08-2018T22:03:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah kiwi
20-08-2018T22:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a video converter/downloaded that can transfer all the videos to an on-computer playlist
20-08-2018T22:04:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And no ads
20-08-2018T22:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause it‚Äôs downloaded
20-08-2018T22:04:28,Twokinds,Oh is there?
20-08-2018T22:04:31,Twokinds,That would be really handy
20-08-2018T22:05:19,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, well it may not be FVD, cuz that's what I use"
20-08-2018T22:05:26,Bgrmystr2,and I don't see any way to download a playlist with it
20-08-2018T22:05:28,Ordithus,"Love the new page, by the way.  Good banter between siblings."
20-08-2018T22:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Now it may reject some videos because it senses the music, but for the most part, it‚Äôll convert and download"
20-08-2018T22:06:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And you have to do it video by video unless you want to run a conversion in a few separate windows
20-08-2018T22:06:40,Bgrmystr2,lol kiwi what is it called
20-08-2018T22:07:14,SpazztasticKiwi,https://www.clipconverter.cc
20-08-2018T22:07:17,Ordithus,"Still seems tedious, but youtube doesn't exactly want to make this easy"
20-08-2018T22:07:45,unsteddyphoenix,wow I remember using that site
20-08-2018T22:07:51,Bgrmystr2,ahh it converts videos
20-08-2018T22:07:53,unsteddyphoenix,Somewhat nostalgic
20-08-2018T22:08:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Instructions are on the page, and I‚Äôve never had a problem with it but it may be pest to run it through a virus checker just in case"
20-08-2018T22:08:08,Bgrmystr2,the one I have takes the audio stream itself that youtube plays
20-08-2018T22:08:10,SpazztasticKiwi,*best
20-08-2018T22:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,You can convert the video or turn it into a strict audio file
20-08-2018T22:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs how I used to save YouTube videos to my computer to watch offline
20-08-2018T22:09:05,Ordithus,"You could also do something absurdly silly, like use a mic input on a tape deck :ctwokinds-natsducky:"
20-08-2018T22:09:09,Bgrmystr2,"that's interesting, but I can only imagine it will lower the audio quality of songs"
20-08-2018T22:09:17,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's converting them
20-08-2018T22:09:24,Bgrmystr2,not getting the audio track itself
20-08-2018T22:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,It hasn‚Äôt that I‚Äôve really noticed
20-08-2018T22:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"If the audio is weird as it was downloaded for the YouTube video, yeah, it‚Äôll be bad, but in my experience, it just creates an offline form of the video"
20-08-2018T22:10:17,Bgrmystr2,"it happens though, when you convert lossy audio, and youtube doesn't usually use lossless"
20-08-2018T22:10:25,Ordithus,"A first-pass recompression won't do too much damage, if the original is high quality enough"
20-08-2018T22:10:55,Ordithus,Make sure the video is in HD.  I think you'd need that to get the best audio off youtube
20-08-2018T22:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,The site used to convert and download VEVO channels until it began noticing copyright
20-08-2018T22:11:21,Bgrmystr2,I just ignore that possibility alltogether and get the audio directly from the site.
20-08-2018T22:11:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Then it pops up that it detects possible copyrighted music, or that it just detects music in general"
20-08-2018T22:12:05,Bgrmystr2,yeah mine doesn't do that xD tis why I use it
20-08-2018T22:12:14,Bgrmystr2,seems like a lot of sites have that problem
20-08-2018T22:12:35,Bgrmystr2,cuz youtube's pushing the web coding to not keep the song saved in the cache
20-08-2018T22:13:01,Bgrmystr2,"and either gives a 404 error to websites, or gives a 403 if it's there"
20-08-2018T22:13:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"That‚Äôs when you use a video that uses the song but isn‚Äôt affiliated as official content, like an anime mix or short animation with the song as the storyteller"
20-08-2018T22:13:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Loopholes
20-08-2018T22:13:46,Ordithus,Yay for DRM
20-08-2018T22:13:51,Bgrmystr2,"not all songs have that benefit, unfortunatelyl ol"
20-08-2018T22:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,That lol looks like it‚Äôs trying to run away there Bgr
20-08-2018T22:14:38,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-snicker:
20-08-2018T22:14:39,Bgrmystr2,a lot of things try to run away from me
20-08-2018T22:14:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw
20-08-2018T22:14:51,Bgrmystr2,"things, people, eh. Happens. :V"
20-08-2018T22:15:04,Bgrmystr2,clearly wasn't worthy of my presence anyway. :ptv-condescending:
20-08-2018T22:15:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Well we‚Äôre still here
20-08-2018T22:15:23,Bgrmystr2,"yes, always appreciated. :)"
20-08-2018T22:15:46,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
20-08-2018T22:15:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"So does clipconverter sound good, Tom? Think you‚Äôd use it?"
20-08-2018T22:16:52,Twokinds,Perhaps
20-08-2018T22:16:54,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. if I had the playlist, I could go and get the audio files myself so tom wouldn't have to fuck with it :U"
20-08-2018T22:17:04,Bgrmystr2,but I don't lol
20-08-2018T22:17:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, don‚Äôt set off too many downloads at once or close them until they actually tell you ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù. This may sound like ‚Äúduh, I‚Äôm not that stupid‚Äù info, but"
20-08-2018T22:18:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I did that once or twice and the download wasn‚Äôt complete and it corrupted. And I had to go through the entire download process again
20-08-2018T22:20:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"When it‚Äôs all said and done, the entire playlist would probably fit on a USB. Mine did, and since I know too many nosy ass people, I password locked the USB"
20-08-2018T22:22:16,Bgrmystr2,yeah but usbs come in ALL different sizes
20-08-2018T22:22:39,Bgrmystr2,"so if the songs really were small, then they did actually lose a lot of quality if they were bigger than that when uploaded to youtube"
20-08-2018T22:23:39,SpazztasticKiwi,The USB stored everything as videos. In case my laptop crashed. It also had a few important pictures
20-08-2018T22:24:11,SpazztasticKiwi,My second USB held my backup school assignments and research
20-08-2018T22:24:58,Ordithus,"A 64 GB drive can fit a LOT of music.  Like, 1000 or so hours of 128 kbps music."
20-08-2018T22:25:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's a fairly large USB Ord
20-08-2018T22:25:44,Ordithus,"I've got one, it wasn't even expensive"
20-08-2018T22:26:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I have five USBs. I two are 8GB if I remember right but they‚Äôre old and the number is worn off
20-08-2018T22:26:02,Ordithus,"Granted, I can only use 32 GB of it thanks to my car..."
20-08-2018T22:26:08,Bgrmystr2,"I've got a 2gb, and 8gb, and a 16gb. I'd give for 64gb. -_-"
20-08-2018T22:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,*I know
20-08-2018T22:27:03,Ordithus,"Still, even a 16 GB drive could hold around 250 hours!"
20-08-2018T22:27:42,Bgrmystr2,250 hours? xD
20-08-2018T22:27:46,Bgrmystr2,I dunno about tha
20-08-2018T22:27:50,Bgrmystr2,that* even
20-08-2018T22:27:56,Ordithus,"If I can do math, which is debatable"
20-08-2018T22:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know we sell 64 GB drives, but they‚Äôre not exactly flying off the shelves. They‚Äôre expensive"
20-08-2018T22:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Online, you can get a 256 GB chip for $100"
20-08-2018T22:30:22,Bgrmystr2,yeah at that point they're basically SSDs
20-08-2018T22:30:28,Bgrmystr2,but with a slower connection speed
20-08-2018T22:30:31,Bgrmystr2,cuz USB
20-08-2018T22:31:21,Ordithus,"Anyways... Tom, I think you should just sing throat singing for the streams"
20-08-2018T22:31:38,Bgrmystr2,256gb on a flash drive is crazy though.. I'm still sitting on a 500gb external drive from WD
20-08-2018T22:31:38,SpazztasticKiwi,You mean hum?
20-08-2018T22:31:56,Bgrmystr2,"accapella preferably, kiwi :P"
20-08-2018T22:32:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Him Skrillix
20-08-2018T22:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,*hum
20-08-2018T22:32:14,Bgrmystr2,jesus haha
20-08-2018T22:33:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you guys ever heard the epic rap battle on YouTube about Skrillix?
20-08-2018T22:33:15,Bgrmystr2,hmm not really
20-08-2018T22:33:21,Ordithus,Not seen that one
20-08-2018T22:33:51,SpazztasticKiwi,https://youtu.be/_6Au0xCg3PI
20-08-2018T22:34:00,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs beautiful
20-08-2018T22:34:41,Ordithus,"Throat singing, only a mic is required https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx8hrhBZJ98"
20-08-2018T22:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Call me crazy but I don‚Äôt see Tom doing that
20-08-2018T22:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool tho
20-08-2018T22:38:22,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôve also done BF vs Deadpool
20-08-2018T22:38:46,SpazztasticKiwi,*Boba Fett
20-08-2018T22:39:16,Twokinds,sings!
20-08-2018T22:39:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
20-08-2018T22:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Welp
20-08-2018T22:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,There it is
20-08-2018T22:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,First sign of the apocalypse
20-08-2018T22:41:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Errbody run
20-08-2018T22:42:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And someone put that dying animal out of its misery
20-08-2018T22:43:49,unsteddyphoenix,I think talking comes before singing
20-08-2018T22:43:53,unsteddyphoenix,Baby steps here
20-08-2018T22:46:36,Bgrmystr2,tom's talked a few times
20-08-2018T22:46:40,Bgrmystr2,we're covered
20-08-2018T22:47:49,Bgrmystr2,rofl throat singing sounds like when Peter Frampton uses the voice box for his guitar
20-08-2018T22:47:50,Bgrmystr2,cool shit
20-08-2018T22:48:08,Ordithus,"I have no idea how it works, but it do, and it is amazing"
20-08-2018T22:48:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Wow Tom speaks?
20-08-2018T22:48:44,SpazztasticKiwi,What a revolution
20-08-2018T22:48:52,unsteddyphoenix,Revalation?
20-08-2018T22:49:01,SpazztasticKiwi,My phone hates me
20-08-2018T22:49:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Thanks for reminding me though
20-08-2018T22:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh, y‚Äôall want to hear the latest work story?"
20-08-2018T22:50:09,unsteddyphoenix,:telephone::telephone::telephone:
20-08-2018T22:51:59,Ordithus,More Tales from the Waly Zone?
20-08-2018T22:53:37,SpazztasticKiwi,We sell chicken sandwich‚Äôs with blue and gold wrappers and ‚ÄúCHICKEN SANDWICH‚Äù written on the front
20-08-2018T22:54:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Girl came by and got one, opened it, and was like, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt a hamburger‚Äù"
20-08-2018T22:54:27,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
20-08-2018T22:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I want to stick my head in the oven
20-08-2018T22:54:43,unsteddyphoenix,Technically she was correct
20-08-2018T22:55:31,Dadrobit,"Late to the party, but mp3 is actually terribly bad, and I hate that it's still so widely used."
20-08-2018T22:56:02,Ordithus,"Eh, with a high enough bitrate, it's OK."
20-08-2018T22:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Then she picked up mayonnaise packet when she was looking for ketchup
20-08-2018T22:56:20,Ordithus,"I don't think this person can read, Kiwi"
20-08-2018T22:56:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"To be fair, she was also nose deep in her phone the whole time too"
20-08-2018T22:57:13,Dadrobit,"Nah, even high bit rate the complete dissolution of all frequencies above 16k is simply not good, not to mention the distortion added to the frequencies that are left."
20-08-2018T22:57:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if the reading was the issue, what about the fact that the chicken paddy doesn‚Äôt look like a hamburger nor does the mayo (white packet) look like ketchup (red packet)"
20-08-2018T22:58:03,SpazztasticKiwi,*patty
20-08-2018T22:58:12,Bgrmystr2,maybe she was blind?
20-08-2018T22:58:30,Dadrobit,Looking at the DJ Cutman song from earlier https://i.imgur.com/62HUGjB.png
20-08-2018T22:58:35,Ordithus,"Granted, there are lossless formats that can be almost as compact as some MP3s"
20-08-2018T22:59:02,SpazztasticKiwi,She was staring at her phone. Not blind
20-08-2018T22:59:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Just not paying a bit of attention
20-08-2018T22:59:22,unsteddyphoenix,"So practically, she was blind"
20-08-2018T22:59:29,Ordithus,Blind to the world
20-08-2018T23:00:13,Dadrobit,Here's a fun exercise to see just how bad the mp3 distortion affects the music. Take out the mono channel and all that lossy crud comes right through.
20-08-2018T23:00:38,Ordithus,Subtract the music from the music?
20-08-2018T23:00:44,Dadrobit,https://soundcloud.com/daddrobit/weird-dj-cuts/s-oOEHI
20-08-2018T23:01:24,Ordithus,"Ick.  Fortunately, we don't listen to it like that!"
20-08-2018T23:02:00,Bgrmystr2,the problem is you can still hear that when the song is playing normally
20-08-2018T23:02:10,Ordithus,"Honestly, it's entertaining in its horror"
20-08-2018T23:02:17,Bgrmystr2,you just need a better audio system generally
20-08-2018T23:02:35,Bgrmystr2,"some ppl don't hear very well though, so there's that"
20-08-2018T23:03:04,Ordithus,My audio system is fine... I just don't pay that much attention to it
20-08-2018T23:04:00,SpazztasticKiwi,What song is that again?
20-08-2018T23:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And are you talking about the echo like noise or is that just me?
20-08-2018T23:04:26,Bgrmystr2,it tends to take decent :money_with_wings: value stereo to be able to hear the difference
20-08-2018T23:05:07,Ordithus,What's the track title to that one?
20-08-2018T23:05:12,Bgrmystr2,"I say stereo, but audio system*"
20-08-2018T23:05:21,Bgrmystr2,it's this one  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7dlT6VRsdw
20-08-2018T23:05:39,Ordithus,Thank you
20-08-2018T23:06:19,Bgrmystr2,dadro is simply pointing out where the mp3 compression itself destroyed the quality of the song in some places
20-08-2018T23:06:36,Bgrmystr2,"and with that soundcloud link, it's fairly apparent lol"
20-08-2018T23:07:23,Ordithus,"The soundcloud makes it obvious, yeah.  I can maybe hear it, a bit, in the full."
20-08-2018T23:07:28,Ordithus,Easy to gloss over
20-08-2018T23:08:17,Ordithus,I guess I wouldn't make a good sound engineer :confused:
20-08-2018T23:08:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, all those clicks and warbles are the mp3 compression at work. You can still hear it mixed in with the full mix, but most folks won't notice it until it's blatantly pointed out like that."
20-08-2018T23:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My taste is too all over the place to be too much of a critic
20-08-2018T23:09:25,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, what dadro said :u"
20-08-2018T23:10:01,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately, some stereos just don't have the range to even play the better quality ones"
20-08-2018T23:10:05,Bgrmystr2,and they sound the same
20-08-2018T23:10:08,Dadrobit,:/ Internet is going in and out. feelsbadman
20-08-2018T23:10:13,Bgrmystr2,cuz the audio system is just not good enough
20-08-2018T23:11:02,Ordithus,"I'd give my setup a ""high-end consumer"" grade.  Not audiophile stuff, even remotely."
20-08-2018T23:11:28,Bgrmystr2,gotta get that full range.. lowballing subs and nice tweeters help
20-08-2018T23:12:14,Bgrmystr2,just recently was given two tweeter sets
20-08-2018T23:12:28,Bgrmystr2,so I got em hooked up the other day
20-08-2018T23:14:09,SpazztasticKiwi,SoundCloud is my new friend
20-08-2018T23:15:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Would that be a better option for you Tom? SoundCloud?
20-08-2018T23:15:58,unsteddyphoenix,"There's lots of better options, just that it's a lot of work to transfer a playlist"
20-08-2018T23:18:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Thinking on that now as I look at my 200+
20-08-2018T23:19:46,Dadrobit,Soundcloud costs money after a certain point. It's only free for the first few minutes of uploaded audio.
20-08-2018T23:20:03,Dadrobit,3 hours are free.
20-08-2018T23:22:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah it‚Äôs nice, but looking at it more, it‚Äôs gonna annoy me in some spots"
20-08-2018T23:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll stick to my usual
20-08-2018T23:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I don‚Äôt ever remember using shuffle on my YouTube list
