06-12-2018T00:03:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Got my tracking number the other day
06-12-2018T00:04:37,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
06-12-2018T00:04:55,SpazztasticKiwi,It says they’re still somehow processing it
06-12-2018T00:05:59,Ordithus,Huh.  Hopefully that is resolved soon.  Could just be the volume of holiday shipping...
06-12-2018T00:07:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I ordered this 8 months ago. It has fuck all to do with the holidays
06-12-2018T00:08:02,Ordithus,"The actual shipment, I mean"
06-12-2018T00:08:34,Ordithus,"Yeah, Keenspot has been having major trouble with this."
06-12-2018T00:11:52,Bgrmystr2,wait wtf you ordered it 8 months ago
06-12-2018T00:11:56,Bgrmystr2,wtf is keenspot doing
06-12-2018T00:12:30,Bgrmystr2,Honestly I'd rather just send money direct to tom if he had any spares. :u
06-12-2018T00:13:20,Ordithus,"It was a preorder, and they only started actually shipping out Sept/Oct."
06-12-2018T00:13:37,Ordithus,"Kiwi, what is the shipment status?"
06-12-2018T00:14:09,Bgrmystr2,well yeah but...  2 months?
06-12-2018T00:14:13,Bgrmystr2,christ
06-12-2018T00:14:16,Ordithus,"Yes, still very bad"
06-12-2018T00:16:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s says the shipping label has been created
06-12-2018T00:16:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Today
06-12-2018T00:16:40,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s it
06-12-2018T00:16:47,Ordithus,Today?  Give it some time
06-12-2018T00:17:03,Ordithus,"Might ship tomorrow or next week.  If it doesn't, contact them"
06-12-2018T00:17:51,Ordithus,"In my case, it showed ""shipping label created"" for two months.  Turns out it was lost, but Keenspot refunded me, and Tom stepped up big <3"
06-12-2018T00:17:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d contacted them before when it was going on 6 months
06-12-2018T00:18:10,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. how many orders do they REALLY have to process?
06-12-2018T00:18:22,SpazztasticKiwi,They just said “oh we’re soooo sorry please be patient “
06-12-2018T00:18:38,Bgrmystr2,patient is fine. Months of patience is not fine.
06-12-2018T00:18:54,Bgrmystr2,:fire: this is not fine. :fire:
06-12-2018T00:19:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I was ok with 3 months or so of waiting. A preorder. They had to ship back and forth to Tom. Lots of orders
06-12-2018T00:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,That didn’t bug me at all. I’ve done preordered stuff before
06-12-2018T00:19:41,Bgrmystr2,well it wasn't being shipped till recently so it doesn't matter
06-12-2018T00:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But this is not
06-12-2018T00:19:59,Bgrmystr2,"preorders don't ship when you order, they ship when they're released. Hence the name of it."
06-12-2018T00:20:00,Ordithus,"If the shipping label was created today, that is the last step before it actually ships."
06-12-2018T00:20:04,Bgrmystr2,but this is after it's released :/
06-12-2018T00:20:55,Bgrmystr2,I can understand if it was like.. tom for example.. who had to sign thousands of books and prints and shit from the kickstarter
06-12-2018T00:20:59,Bgrmystr2,and then package them all
06-12-2018T00:21:07,Bgrmystr2,and just good lord that's a lot
06-12-2018T00:21:53,Bgrmystr2,"but they won't have just ONE person on that duty, nor will they have to do it the DAY they're releasing it cuz that's not how it works"
06-12-2018T00:22:12,Bgrmystr2,they already have the product and just need to properly package it for shipping.
06-12-2018T00:23:09,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I'd really have to know wtf is holding them back, but generally I'd find that wait completely unacceptable."
06-12-2018T00:23:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m aware of that. It’s why I’m not using them anymore after this
06-12-2018T00:23:46,Bgrmystr2,I want to believe.. but come on :/
06-12-2018T00:24:06,Bgrmystr2,it's not fair to tom or the people who bought the books.
06-12-2018T00:24:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unless they had a warehouse vandalized or broken into, the delay and “just be patient a little longer” is not flying with me"
06-12-2018T00:25:13,Bgrmystr2,"yeah... though to be fair, if something like that leaked to the public that was purchasing stuff from them, people would have issue with that."
06-12-2018T00:25:28,Bgrmystr2,"and wouldn't look great on em, even if it weren't their fault"
06-12-2018T00:26:56,Ordithus,"Wow, Nyquil kicked in.  Have a good night :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
06-12-2018T00:27:08,Bgrmystr2,gnight ord

06-12-2018T00:50:11,Bgrmystr2,thankfully cat's don't weigh that much lol
06-12-2018T00:50:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah he doesn’t. Likes to sit right on that hip joint though
06-12-2018T00:51:02,Bgrmystr2,yeah prolly not a great thing to happen constantly
06-12-2018T00:51:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta shove him off and brushie the teeth now

06-12-2018T08:11:01,iliar,"Good morning, Tom!"
06-12-2018T08:16:42,iliar,"I am curious. The plot of the comic with Sam and Colin develops in the TwoKinds universe? I mean, is this the same universe, just many years later, or a completely different one?"
06-12-2018T08:17:25,Twokinds,It's related
06-12-2018T08:18:09,Bgrmystr2,"mornin tom, I'm goin to bed :v"
06-12-2018T08:19:17,Bgrmystr2,see you guys at the stream tonight :ptv-greetings:
06-12-2018T08:21:37,Twokinds,G'night!
06-12-2018T08:22:17,iliar,"So in this comic we can see Nora and probably Reni and some other dragons. I am not asking if they will be there. I mean, technically possible?"
06-12-2018T08:23:40,Twokinds,"Nora is in the comic, though isn't a character in the story."
06-12-2018T08:23:46,Twokinds,She's in the background.
06-12-2018T08:40:38,iliar,"I can not say that in TwoKinds she is character in the story. Even when she sailed on a ship together with the main characters she didn't do anything special. Looks like she’s a spectator, who picked the best place in front row."
06-12-2018T08:41:39,Twokinds,lol yeah true
06-12-2018T09:24:01,unsteddyphoenix,Tom! I received your package!

06-12-2018T09:24:33,Twokinds,I was expecting it not to arrive for another week
06-12-2018T09:25:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, it made it safe and sound~"
06-12-2018T09:25:16,unsteddyphoenix,You really went above and beyond anything I was even hoping for wow
06-12-2018T09:25:20,Twokinds,I'm glad. I tried my best to make sure it was packed up well.
06-12-2018T09:25:44,unsteddyphoenix,"You've made my...year, with this. <3"

06-12-2018T09:32:37,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I won't be doing that for another week."
06-12-2018T09:33:13,CrimsonQuill,I've reached the most recent strips...I've got so much anticipation for what's going on next.

06-12-2018T09:38:38,TerraTheWizard,they *should* get here on time
06-12-2018T09:38:52,TerraTheWizard,providing the US side of the shipping isn't slower than usual
06-12-2018T10:17:32,CrimsonQuill,I'm watching the Ancient Magus' bride.
06-12-2018T10:40:12,CrimsonQuill,It's really good.

06-12-2018T12:41:09,Twokinds,And cheap
06-12-2018T12:41:12,CrimsonQuill,What was the catch?
06-12-2018T12:41:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And haunted?
06-12-2018T12:41:29,CrimsonQuill,There's always a catch in these things.
06-12-2018T12:41:30,Ordithus,Oh?
06-12-2018T12:41:45,Twokinds,Went into google street view. House next door: Dog Kennel.
06-12-2018T12:41:54,CrimsonQuill,Oooh.
06-12-2018T12:41:59,CrimsonQuill,That explains the price.
06-12-2018T12:42:06,Ordithus,Yeesh not good neighbors
06-12-2018T12:42:36,Twokinds,lol yeah
06-12-2018T12:42:37,SpazztasticKiwi,“There’s a squirrel in your yard. Let me tell you for the next two hours” 🐕

06-12-2018T12:43:29,CrimsonQuill,@Ordithus Or until Death takes a holiday

06-12-2018T12:43:57,SpazztasticKiwi,So this mean your house hunting again?
06-12-2018T12:44:18,TerraTheWizard,read hunting as haunting
06-12-2018T12:44:20,Twokinds,You never know
06-12-2018T12:44:32,Twokinds,It's such a shame because otherwise it's perfect
06-12-2018T12:44:38,Twokinds,Private driveway.
06-12-2018T12:44:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"With how Tom is, he could haunt a house"
06-12-2018T12:45:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Not like there’ll be any wild parties
06-12-2018T12:45:16,CrimsonQuill,What about one of those out-of-the-way houses like in that autumn cocoa picture you did?
06-12-2018T12:45:22,CrimsonQuill,By a forest.
06-12-2018T12:45:30,CrimsonQuill,Too remote?
06-12-2018T12:46:07,SpazztasticKiwi,There was another little house go up for sale around here
06-12-2018T12:46:15,Twokinds,Yeah I'd like that
06-12-2018T12:46:34,Twokinds,"As long as Krogers delivers and internet still works, I'm good with being far from others."
06-12-2018T12:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Had a bit of porch but it’s in a neighborhood. Near a school. And a highway
06-12-2018T12:46:39,Twokinds,"In fact, I'd prefer it."
06-12-2018T12:47:12,CrimsonQuill,"Yes, because I read the description on how you'd like to just live somewhere where you can watch nature go by."
06-12-2018T12:47:17,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s land out here for sale most often
06-12-2018T12:47:22,CrimsonQuill,Give you ideas for drawing.
06-12-2018T12:48:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Isolated is pretty easy to find too. But you either build a house or gotta go looking cause most houses that are advertised are commonly in or near-city
06-12-2018T12:48:58,Ordithus,That is where most of the houses are
06-12-2018T12:49:00,Twokinds,That would be ideal
06-12-2018T12:49:15,CrimsonQuill,You could sit on the steps in the morning with some tea.
06-12-2018T12:49:30,CrimsonQuill,A nice pot of Twinings. Earl Grey.
06-12-2018T12:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean if you ever want to look, that’s you. But 🤷🏻‍♀️"
06-12-2018T12:49:55,Twokinds,LOL
06-12-2018T12:50:18,Twokinds,There's a house for sake that has a runway
06-12-2018T12:50:22,Twokinds,sale*
06-12-2018T12:50:29,Ordithus,Sweet
06-12-2018T12:50:34,CrimsonQuill,Wh-what? Why? Why?
06-12-2018T12:50:39,CrimsonQuill,Just why?
06-12-2018T12:50:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Another house behind the Walmart went up too
06-12-2018T12:50:44,TerraTheWizard,lol
06-12-2018T12:50:53,Twokinds,For crops
06-12-2018T12:50:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Bad driver?

06-12-2018T12:51:09,Ordithus,And an airplane
06-12-2018T12:51:16,Twokinds,"The pictures show a prop plane, though I'm guessing it doesn't come with the house"
06-12-2018T12:51:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully not
06-12-2018T12:51:26,Ordithus,"Haha, see if they'll leave it"
06-12-2018T12:51:39,SpazztasticKiwi,There’d be someone who’d try using it
06-12-2018T12:51:39,CrimsonQuill,"I'd just like a house close to a forest, but not too far away from a town. Somewhere where the sky is clear as possible, but with decent internet and network."
06-12-2018T12:51:49,Twokinds,It's actually amazingly reasonable for the price.
06-12-2018T12:51:54,CrimsonQuill,Like that's going to happen for another decade...
06-12-2018T12:52:11,TerraTheWizard,good luck getting the good internet part
06-12-2018T12:52:13,Ordithus,"If the house gets cable TV, it may have good internet"

06-12-2018T12:55:02,Ordithus,Goats!  Never have to mow.  And then you can have a bonkers herding dog
06-12-2018T12:55:07,Ordithus,And it won't destroy your house
06-12-2018T12:55:11,CrimsonQuill,I named one Cyclops...after a cockrel gored his eye out.

06-12-2018T12:56:47,TerraTheWizard,my neighbours got a new dog that would bark nonstop whenever they went out
06-12-2018T12:56:53,TerraTheWizard,took about a year for it to calm down
06-12-2018T12:57:01,CrimsonQuill,My aunt has four dogs and some cats.

06-12-2018T12:57:33,CrimsonQuill,I caught Smoky with a mouse or a vole...I couldn't tell which. It didn't have a head.
06-12-2018T12:57:44,CrimsonQuill,He's adorably fluffy though.

06-12-2018T14:38:46,CrimsonQuill,Hi!
06-12-2018T14:38:51,TerraTheWizard,'lo
06-12-2018T14:38:57,CrimsonQuill,o/
06-12-2018T14:39:02,CrimsonQuill,How are things?
06-12-2018T14:39:21,TerraTheWizard,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
06-12-2018T14:39:41,CrimsonQuill,"It's very quiet, isn't it?"
06-12-2018T14:40:51,Twokinds,Did you know you can just buy prescription glasses on amazon?
06-12-2018T14:40:59,CrimsonQuill,No.
06-12-2018T14:41:04,CrimsonQuill,I didn't.
06-12-2018T14:41:13,CrimsonQuill,That's actually a thing?
06-12-2018T14:41:53,Twokinds,A few years ago I spent $400 on an appointment and pair of glasses from lenscrafters.
06-12-2018T14:42:23,Twokinds,"Recently, I bought a pair from amazon for 12 dollars."
06-12-2018T14:42:36,CrimsonQuill,Are they proper quality?
06-12-2018T14:42:49,Twokinds,They're just as good as my other ones.
06-12-2018T14:42:54,CrimsonQuill,Wierd.
06-12-2018T14:43:02,Twokinds,Didn't need a prescription or anything.
06-12-2018T14:43:07,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm....
06-12-2018T14:43:23,ScarderXD,lol
06-12-2018T14:43:32,CrimsonQuill,"Well, well done you."
06-12-2018T14:43:41,CrimsonQuill,I didn't know that.
06-12-2018T14:43:49,CrimsonQuill,"But then again, I don't wear glasses..."
06-12-2018T14:43:53,Twokinds,Mmhm
06-12-2018T14:44:30,TerraTheWizard,and now i remember the bad jokes i made when i got my first glasses
06-12-2018T14:44:33,CrimsonQuill,I wear a fluffy hat instead.
06-12-2018T14:44:45,Twokinds,"The only reason it wouldn't help is if your eyesight is worse than -4.00, or you have different prescriptions in each eye."
06-12-2018T14:44:55,TerraTheWizard,"namely: ""wow, everything's in HD now!"""
06-12-2018T14:45:35,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, well thankfully, my eyes have not dissolved yet...although they will if I keep spending too much time in front of a computer..."
06-12-2018T14:46:43,ScarderXD,i remember when i got my glasses
06-12-2018T14:46:48,CrimsonQuill,I'll be right back. I need to restart my PC...something's wrong.
06-12-2018T14:46:48,Azumachan,Most of the time i spend 500+ on prescriptions
06-12-2018T14:47:21,TerraTheWizard,"that was my theory for why i had bad eyesight, but seeing (lol) as they've not changed since my first prescription & i've spent vastly more time infront of a pc,"
06-12-2018T14:47:44,TerraTheWizard,i concluded that puberty decided i didn't need perfect vision
06-12-2018T14:51:00,TerraTheWizard,"went to look for my prescription to see what it was, the optician has really bad handwriting"
06-12-2018T14:51:30,TerraTheWizard,and i don't know where the printed one is
06-12-2018T14:52:06,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I don't really know how that stuff works,"
06-12-2018T14:53:06,TerraTheWizard,it either says -0.50 or -1.50
06-12-2018T14:53:11,TerraTheWizard,probably the latter
06-12-2018T14:53:17,CrimsonQuill,mmm...
06-12-2018T14:53:25,CrimsonQuill,Never had my eyesight tested
06-12-2018T14:53:41,CrimsonQuill,I can see pretty nicely
06-12-2018T14:53:45,TerraTheWizard,i know someone with -11.00
06-12-2018T14:53:48,TerraTheWizard,idk how they see
06-12-2018T14:53:57,CrimsonQuill,-11?
06-12-2018T14:54:04,TerraTheWizard,super duper near sighted
06-12-2018T14:54:04,CrimsonQuill,That seems bad.
06-12-2018T14:54:12,TerraTheWizard,"like, can't see past their nose nearsighted"
06-12-2018T14:54:22,CrimsonQuill,That is bad.
06-12-2018T14:54:40,CrimsonQuill,I hope they have REALLY good glasses.
06-12-2018T14:55:16,TerraTheWizard,they do
06-12-2018T14:55:25,CrimsonQuill,Good.
06-12-2018T14:55:27,TerraTheWizard,but i think they go full velma if they drop them
06-12-2018T14:55:29,TerraTheWizard,lol
06-12-2018T14:55:43,CrimsonQuill,I don't really go for Scooby Doo
06-12-2018T14:55:53,CrimsonQuill,"WHen I was much younger yes, now no."
06-12-2018T14:56:29,TerraTheWizard,"they've rebooted it like 5 times, each time getting worse"
06-12-2018T14:57:12,CrimsonQuill,I just try to avoid any animation that isn't anime.
06-12-2018T14:57:20,CrimsonQuill,There are only a few exceptions.
06-12-2018T14:57:41,CrimsonQuill,Most of them being Aardman (the people who made Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run)
06-12-2018T14:57:49,CrimsonQuill,A few from Dreamworks
06-12-2018T14:57:58,CrimsonQuill,And maybe a few from Pixar.
06-12-2018T14:58:07,CrimsonQuill,But I'm more an Anime person.

06-12-2018T20:46:47,RimaDraws,her fur pattern reminds me of flora's because she has that white under belly and under the tail

06-12-2018T20:47:20,RimaDraws,im just unsure with a name but i wanted to name her winter after winter schnee

06-12-2018T20:53:41,RimaDraws,no her name is gonna be winter
06-12-2018T20:53:41,MrMongMong,Because we seem to equate winter with a need to purchase as much milk as possible in case a storm comes I guess?
06-12-2018T20:54:10,MrMongMong,Ok.
06-12-2018T20:54:47,MrMongMong,"That's delightful. When you hear her paws heading toward you, you can say: ""Brace yourselves, winter is coming"""

06-12-2018T23:16:28,ZRO4825,Blue is one of the greatest parts of Yosh! imo. And I'm not just saying that cuz she's one of the busty ladies either.
06-12-2018T23:16:58,Mihari,Sure you are. XD
06-12-2018T23:17:58,ZRO4825,"Iz true!! I <3 the wacky shit Blue gets up to, and her teasing of Nami and the other ladies is some of the best highlights of the comic imo. Also, she got Toyoko in the black dress. <3"
06-12-2018T23:18:17,SageSaga,Forever in Blue's debt

06-12-2018T23:23:00,ZRO4825,lol
06-12-2018T23:23:01,Tharkis,"today the blue mccaw was declared officially extinct in the wild, with only an extremely small dwindling number alive in captivity"
06-12-2018T23:23:12,Combak,RIP

06-12-2018T23:27:17,FoxxTrotter,"The last apparent sighting of a Spix's macaw in the wild was back in 2016. Even at that time, the ICUN considered them extinct in the wild."
06-12-2018T23:28:17,FoxxTrotter,"Like Tharkis said, though, there are captive breeding programs going on with the species."
06-12-2018T23:29:19,FoxxTrotter,"Something similar with the red wolf species here in NC. There aren't many of those left, either."

06-12-2018T23:36:05,Ordithus,It's not completely awful
06-12-2018T23:36:07,ZRO4825,"Well, it kinda does a nice pastel watercolor effect? lol"
06-12-2018T23:36:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Eh, its still a nice look"
06-12-2018T23:36:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Not a complete fail
06-12-2018T23:37:46,FluffKevlar,you can adjust it with 'advanced option' thing.
06-12-2018T23:37:49,FluffKevlar,also hi

06-12-2018T23:38:11,ChampionOfBagels,Hola fluff
06-12-2018T23:38:38,SageSaga,let's see if this works worse or better
06-12-2018T23:39:08,SageSaga,worse
06-12-2018T23:39:24,Bgrmystr2,lol
06-12-2018T23:39:31,Bgrmystr2,did it even color half of it?
06-12-2018T23:39:41,Bgrmystr2,it looks like it actually spreads the amount of color you put on it
06-12-2018T23:39:47,Bgrmystr2,rather than just filling it in
06-12-2018T23:39:55,Ordithus,"Like butter, spread over too much bread"
06-12-2018T23:40:02,Bgrmystr2,"cuz the less color you put on it, the lighter it seems to be"
06-12-2018T23:41:00,Kanrod,"Sup, Fluff"
06-12-2018T23:41:00,Zakuru,almost done with this page >~<
06-12-2018T23:41:16,Kanrod,Was cool seeing you again at MFF!
06-12-2018T23:42:06,Ordithus,"Still very washed out, but maybe a bit better.  It's got a long ways to go, though"
06-12-2018T23:42:12,Ordithus,"Very, very far"
06-12-2018T23:47:14,FluffKevlar,hey! thanks

06-12-2018T23:50:50,SageSaga,wanna see what happens if i hit colorize on a flat colored image?
06-12-2018T23:51:01,SableArts,Wow. Just straight-up murders her.

06-12-2018T23:52:15,InTheLionsDen,Odd tone overlap on the face.
06-12-2018T23:52:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah it looks really bad
06-12-2018T23:52:47,FluffKevlar,"adjust the bleed in options. not perfect, but again its new tech"
06-12-2018T23:52:50,SageSaga,there's gotta be a cool use for colorize
06-12-2018T23:53:08,Ordithus,"If you want it to look like a washed out watercolor, it's your tool"
06-12-2018T23:53:10,SageSaga,there's nothing called bleed in the options
