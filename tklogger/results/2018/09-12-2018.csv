09-12-2018T00:07:30,Bgrmystr2,though most characters and most people don't
09-12-2018T00:07:32,Bgrmystr2,so eh
09-12-2018T00:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s about how I am
09-12-2018T00:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"You may amuse me, but try impressing me. That’s harder"
09-12-2018T00:08:57,Bgrmystr2,"90% of the time I'm impressed by how stupid some people are, because I thought / expected better."
09-12-2018T00:09:07,Bgrmystr2,"which is not great, but"
09-12-2018T00:09:13,Bgrmystr2,impressive none the less.

09-12-2018T00:11:24,Ordithus,"""Hooman you haz something on face.  I halp"""
09-12-2018T00:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I got other insults by the way
09-12-2018T00:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,One of my favorites is “you seem to have plenty of get up and go. So why don’t you?”
09-12-2018T00:17:12,SpazztasticKiwi,And “I’ll help you out. Which way did you come in?”
09-12-2018T00:24:08,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: night
09-12-2018T00:25:39,Twokinds,Man I am tired
09-12-2018T00:25:47,Twokinds,But I can't go to sleep until Alexa tells me to.
09-12-2018T00:26:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Alexa told me to tell you it’s bed time
09-12-2018T00:26:34,Twokinds,I feel like you are being disingenuous.
09-12-2018T00:26:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Who me:ptv-wondering:
09-12-2018T00:27:06,Twokinds,Or duplicitous
09-12-2018T00:27:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Humans lie, thats why you listen to robots"
09-12-2018T00:27:24,Twokinds,Exactly!
09-12-2018T00:27:39,Dadrobit,"I mean, if you go to bed a little bit early and then wake up at the same time as usual, it's kinda like you got to ignore your secretary and get to still sleep in!"
09-12-2018T00:27:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never said I wasn’t a robot
09-12-2018T00:27:58,Twokinds,lol
09-12-2018T00:28:08,Twokinds,"I can't, because her voice commands are on a routine."
09-12-2018T00:28:43,Twokinds,"If I go to bed early, then as I'm going to sleep 30 min later she'll cut in and tell me it's time for bed."
09-12-2018T00:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Watch a YouTube video or something then for 30 minutes
09-12-2018T00:29:08,Dadrobit,You can't disable that for a night?
09-12-2018T00:29:31,Twokinds,Well probably but I haven't figured out how
09-12-2018T00:29:38,Bgrmystr2,it's easy tom. Go to sleep and then sleep through the notification.
09-12-2018T00:29:46,Twokinds,It's better if I don't know. That way I can't stop her from telling me what to do.
09-12-2018T00:29:55,Dadrobit,Throw a towel over it
09-12-2018T00:29:57,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
09-12-2018T00:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it’s an alarm, you can just tell her to disable the alarm"
09-12-2018T00:30:49,unsteddyphoenix,shh dont tell him
09-12-2018T00:30:55,Twokinds,"Ah, she just gave the bed warning."
09-12-2018T00:30:58,unsteddyphoenix,The robot overlords must be obeyed
09-12-2018T00:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Time to brush your teeth, Tom!”"
09-12-2018T00:34:07,iliar,"Tom, you are a troll. You made a very SFW sketch on the basis of an NSFW suggestion."
09-12-2018T00:34:45,Dadrobit,Which one?
09-12-2018T00:39:41,Bgrmystr2,"Are you just figuring this out now, Iliar? lol"
09-12-2018T00:40:10,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: or are you making another note we can stick into the pile
09-12-2018T00:41:31,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I feel like thats happened more than once
09-12-2018T00:41:50,iliar,I expected little bit more NSFW result when suggested this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/359539122496339968/521503857713348638/sk.6_waifu2x_n1.png
09-12-2018T00:42:27,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt that exactly what the suggestion asked?
09-12-2018T00:42:30,Twokinds,"Sorry, I was not entirely sure what to do with it."
09-12-2018T00:42:33,unsteddyphoenix,What did you expect :thinking:
09-12-2018T00:42:45,unsteddyphoenix,Laura TELLS natani Keiths kinks right?
09-12-2018T00:43:47,Twokinds,"lol if it had been ""showing"" I could see it being more"
09-12-2018T00:45:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom Lawyer: kink sinker
09-12-2018T00:46:32,Bgrmystr2,ahh that
09-12-2018T00:46:43,Dadrobit,That's about what I was expecting from that suggestion. Tom is not the place to go for lewds.
09-12-2018T00:46:55,Dadrobit,Or foot massages for that matter.
09-12-2018T00:46:56,iliar,"Once again, my bad English fails me."
09-12-2018T00:47:54,unsteddyphoenix,Now paw massages on the other hand...
09-12-2018T00:48:05,unsteddyphoenix,inherently lewd anyway
09-12-2018T00:48:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Not necessarily bad English. Toms just a snarky smartass
09-12-2018T00:48:53,SpazztasticKiwi,And I mean that in the nicest way
09-12-2018T00:48:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course
09-12-2018T00:49:04,iliar,I expected Natani to start trying advices in practice. Or something like this.
09-12-2018T00:49:52,Dadrobit,That's part two for you then I suppose?
09-12-2018T00:50:00,unsteddyphoenix,^
09-12-2018T00:50:12,Twokinds,Ooo yeah that would make sense
09-12-2018T00:50:27,Dadrobit,Natani just ends up completely awkwardly tangled in the rope.
09-12-2018T00:50:57,unsteddyphoenix,"But she's just tied him up like a prisoner and is like ""ok I dont really get this?"""
09-12-2018T00:51:01,Dadrobit,"Or Natani presents the rope to Keith as a noose ""It's the only knot I know..."""
09-12-2018T00:51:15,unsteddyphoenix,Christ.
09-12-2018T00:51:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Are all the characters bedroom acrobats?
09-12-2018T00:51:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus
09-12-2018T00:51:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Only Laura, Natani has a ways to go"
09-12-2018T00:51:51,Dadrobit,Probably Nora
09-12-2018T00:51:58,unsteddyphoenix,ah true
09-12-2018T00:52:19,SpazztasticKiwi,“Hold the leash”
09-12-2018T00:52:21,SpazztasticKiwi,“No”
09-12-2018T00:52:31,SpazztasticKiwi,“Come on. Just for a minute”
09-12-2018T00:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“He’l no”
09-12-2018T00:52:44,SpazztasticKiwi,hell
09-12-2018T00:53:12,unsteddyphoenix,Have to hold his own leash :(
09-12-2018T00:53:16,unsteddyphoenix,What a cruel fate
09-12-2018T00:53:29,Dadrobit,I think that was Nora askig Trace to hold her leash
09-12-2018T00:53:33,Dadrobit,asking*
09-12-2018T00:53:43,Twokinds,I'm not sure if Natani can be as confident as Laura
09-12-2018T00:53:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, then *her"
09-12-2018T00:54:03,RimaDraws,laura can i dont think i disagree
09-12-2018T00:54:03,THETOXICATOR,Neither am I
09-12-2018T00:54:06,RimaDraws,can't&
09-12-2018T00:54:16,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe Natani will discover a part of herself that she didnt know was there~
09-12-2018T00:54:30,RimaDraws,laura seems so much more self conscious
09-12-2018T00:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,“He likes to be choked? Well that explains why he doesn’t chew-OH”
09-12-2018T00:54:39,unsteddyphoenix,Not in the bedroom
09-12-2018T00:54:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Ignore that last one actually
09-12-2018T00:54:53,Dadrobit,Really? I'm not sure I'm on board with the Laura being a dom canon moreso than Natani. Laura was always portrayed to being more of a coward until the very last minute no?
09-12-2018T00:55:06,RimaDraws,natani would be best dom
09-12-2018T00:55:10,Dadrobit,While Natani is the super gung-ho person
09-12-2018T00:55:15,unsteddyphoenix,Right which is why she flips in the bedroom
09-12-2018T00:55:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Lady in the streets but freak in the sheets
09-12-2018T00:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Ring a bell?
09-12-2018T00:55:30,THETOXICATOR,Almost 7:00am ans still haven't slept yet
09-12-2018T00:55:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Since she feels out of control IRL, she prefers control in that space"
09-12-2018T00:55:41,unsteddyphoenix,The opposite of Nora
09-12-2018T00:56:05,Dadrobit,But she ran away on the wedding day? That was the eternal tie for her bedroom escapades.
09-12-2018T00:56:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Sex out of wedlock is a naughty thing some placed
09-12-2018T00:56:30,Dadrobit,"Just seems odd, even for the sake of irony."
09-12-2018T00:56:32,SpazztasticKiwi,places
09-12-2018T00:56:42,unsteddyphoenix,Yes well...being a bad person doesnt relate to sexual preferences
09-12-2018T00:56:42,RimaDraws,this aint the 50s anymore kiwi
09-12-2018T00:56:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It is in some towns still
09-12-2018T00:57:09,RimaDraws,wow stone age people
09-12-2018T00:57:21,Dadrobit,"Egypt is a country, Spazz, not a town."
09-12-2018T00:57:44,RimaDraws,dad has a point
09-12-2018T00:58:06,Dadrobit,And keidran are canonically promiscuous.
09-12-2018T00:58:18,RimaDraws,coy or ?
09-12-2018T00:58:21,RimaDraws,playful
09-12-2018T00:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Around here, a girl can get looks™️ for having a guy stay for a night"
09-12-2018T00:58:40,unsteddyphoenix,THE LOOKS
09-12-2018T00:58:42,RimaDraws,like i said this aint the 50s lol
09-12-2018T00:58:56,RimaDraws,its hardly looked down on anymore for sleeping with a guy
09-12-2018T00:59:03,Dadrobit,"What was it Tom said? Something along the lines of ""Bed them on the first date. Get their names over coffee on the second?"""
09-12-2018T00:59:13,RimaDraws,women are having children like crazy before marriage if not at all
09-12-2018T00:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,He did?
09-12-2018T00:59:45,unsteddyphoenix,Thats about how keidran go as I understand yeah
09-12-2018T00:59:49,Dadrobit,"Yeah, a while back."
09-12-2018T01:00:11,RimaDraws,keidrans are also polyamorous type creatures
09-12-2018T01:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s
09-12-2018T01:00:27,SpazztasticKiwi,enlightening I guess
09-12-2018T01:00:40,RimaDraws,meaning one night with one other then another night with another keidran
09-12-2018T01:00:46,RimaDraws,hard to tell where their children are from
09-12-2018T01:00:59,iliar,"Hmm ... I was sure Natani would be interested in these tips. But even in this case: Natani in dom outfit with rope in hands asking Laura ""Are you sure Keith like this?"""
09-12-2018T01:01:19,Twokinds,Seer that is the kind of specifics I like
09-12-2018T01:01:29,RimaDraws,do what tom?
09-12-2018T01:01:42,Twokinds,See*
09-12-2018T01:02:00,unsteddyphoenix,Specifics in sketch reqs?
09-12-2018T01:02:19,RimaDraws,i try to keep mine a few works and specific as possible
09-12-2018T01:02:33,RimaDraws,words
09-12-2018T01:02:34,RimaDraws,omg
09-12-2018T01:02:38,RimaDraws,im so tired..
09-12-2018T01:03:08,THETOXICATOR,"Goodbye, need to get a bit sleep before school."
09-12-2018T01:03:33,iliar,"That's my problem. When I try to trim an idea to 100 characters, the result does not look very good."
09-12-2018T01:03:49,RimaDraws,im sure you could do that iliar
09-12-2018T01:04:01,RimaDraws,you just gotta find a way to shorten a long suggestion
09-12-2018T01:04:12,SpazztasticKiwi,...I think I’m gonna go on to bed after that info
09-12-2018T01:04:53,Dadrobit,"Sweet dreams, Spazz."
09-12-2018T01:05:04,unsteddyphoenix,Night
09-12-2018T01:06:02,Twokinds,Sleep time for me
09-12-2018T01:06:09,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
09-12-2018T01:06:14,iliar,And you said that you don’t like when in suggestion you say what the characters should do and what to say.
09-12-2018T01:06:22,unsteddyphoenix,Night x2
09-12-2018T01:06:33,iliar,"Good night, Tom."
09-12-2018T01:06:47,Twokinds,No I did not
09-12-2018T01:07:18,Twokinds,"I want them to be brief and specfic, without being three paragraphs long."
09-12-2018T01:08:29,Dadrobit,"Have a good night, Tom."
09-12-2018T01:10:40,RimaDraws,Good night tom I have to sleep too.
09-12-2018T01:11:30,RimaDraws,Later guys
09-12-2018T01:14:14,Dadrobit,Aaaaand Done! Job finished and submitted with 45 minutes still to the deadline!
09-12-2018T01:14:17,Dadrobit,o/ Rima
09-12-2018T01:15:29,unsteddyphoenix,Nice dad!
09-12-2018T01:15:56,unsteddyphoenix,See? You couldvr watched 44 minutes more of stream!
09-12-2018T01:17:21,Dadrobit,"I mean, I told the client ""By Monday, so I probably could've submitted it in the morning, but I wanted to get started on other work."
09-12-2018T01:17:35,Dadrobit,"""By Monday,""*"
09-12-2018T01:17:49,Dadrobit,"It was a fun one though, I wanted to do a good job on it."
09-12-2018T01:18:25,unsteddyphoenix,What was it?
09-12-2018T01:19:07,Dadrobit,Playing as a slightly over the top evil character (my favorite) in a hidden object game.
09-12-2018T01:19:28,Dadrobit,"Just under 200 words, $150."
09-12-2018T01:20:36,unsteddyphoenix,Ooh nice
09-12-2018T01:21:23,unsteddyphoenix,Dramatically over the top villians are a vood time
09-12-2018T01:21:53,Dadrobit,"The official descriptor was ""He has a low, bossy and commanding voice, he sounds evil and too self-assured. He talks fast and emotionally"""
09-12-2018T01:22:14,Dadrobit,"So not ~too~ over the top, just enough."
09-12-2018T01:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know. Bed on first date/name on the second is what Tom said about Keidran, right?"
09-12-2018T01:22:44,Dadrobit,But the script leant itself towards it quite well.
09-12-2018T01:22:50,Dadrobit,Yes?
09-12-2018T01:22:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"That mean Basitins are like, Amish in comparison?"
09-12-2018T01:23:19,unsteddyphoenix,Absolutely
09-12-2018T01:23:32,unsteddyphoenix,Basitin strongly dislike keidran in general
09-12-2018T01:23:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"And then with humans, much like now, it’s “how/where you grew up”"
09-12-2018T01:24:03,unsteddyphoenix,They even led a war against keidran at one point
09-12-2018T01:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains some of the “I’m not talking to you” mess
09-12-2018T01:24:49,Dadrobit,"The favorite rule of thumb I heard for when you're ready to bed your significant other, is when you know their middle name off the top of your head."
09-12-2018T01:25:09,unsteddyphoenix,Wolf Keidran wouldve been severely damaged as a culture if humans hadnt saved them
09-12-2018T01:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,One thing go by is never on the first date
09-12-2018T01:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Or before you’re in an actual relationship
09-12-2018T01:26:27,Dadrobit,"I mean, unless their first question is ""What's your middle name?"""
09-12-2018T01:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Though it also raises the question - does that mean Basitins are more romantic
09-12-2018T01:26:48,Dadrobit,A different kind of romance.
09-12-2018T01:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Since they’d be more likely to do dates than one night stands as Keidran
09-12-2018T01:27:57,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah romance in a very different way
09-12-2018T01:28:07,Dadrobit,Likely not many dates either being that the districts are totally separated and intercourse is seen as a State Duty.
09-12-2018T01:28:09,unsteddyphoenix,Their cultures are alien to us
09-12-2018T01:28:37,Dadrobit,"I'm sure it happens, but I don't think it'd be safe to generalize them as ""romantic""."
09-12-2018T01:28:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Although there would be the outlier in each group that would do opposite of the norm
09-12-2018T01:29:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"but that’s what he said was the Keidran belief in a nutshell, right"
09-12-2018T01:30:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause Flora’s obviously an exception as it seems. Dedicated to one person
09-12-2018T01:30:44,Bgrmystr2,I guess I would take a while.. I'm absolutely awful at remembering names of any type
09-12-2018T01:30:48,Bgrmystr2,no matter who it is
09-12-2018T01:31:46,Bgrmystr2,"it took me months to remember my friend's names in highschool, and I'm either the same or worse by now"
09-12-2018T01:32:53,Dadrobit,"Even Flora mentioned that her mother told her it would take time to settle down with a singular person. So yeah, she's the exception."
09-12-2018T01:33:21,Dadrobit,"Who knows, maybe she had some time with Sythe, honestly it might be likely."
09-12-2018T01:33:45,SpazztasticKiwi,If she was young and it was “her culture norm”
09-12-2018T01:33:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Possible
09-12-2018T01:34:17,Dadrobit,"But she did essentially grow up around human culture, so that may have imprinted on her a fair bit."
09-12-2018T01:35:08,SpazztasticKiwi,She still seemed nervous around Trace at first though too. That may be because of how close she was in human culture rather than hers while being told both sides
09-12-2018T01:35:09,Dadrobit,She's only spent a year of her life as an adult with an actual Tiger Clan
09-12-2018T01:36:06,Dadrobit,"Also, she knew that he was the Grand Templar Trace, pretty solid reason to be nervous when you're being rescued by literally Hitler."
09-12-2018T01:39:19,SpazztasticKiwi,At first the nerves was “he’s a powerful human” or “literally hitler” as you say
09-12-2018T01:39:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"But after they fell in love, she was still hesitant"
09-12-2018T01:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to say because she was only home for a year and the rest of the time was Alsace if I remember right
09-12-2018T01:40:35,SpazztasticKiwi,a slave
09-12-2018T01:41:49,Dadrobit,"Actually, we don't know if she returned to her original home, just that she was with a Tiger clan for a year."
09-12-2018T01:42:26,Dadrobit,And the hesitancy was likely due to her relationship with Keiren ending so badly after spending essentially her whole life with him.
09-12-2018T01:43:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t blame her
09-12-2018T01:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s an exception in any case. Got to be plenty more around in all the groups
09-12-2018T01:44:22,Bgrmystr2,"After eating and catching up, I'm going to go on a limb and say Laura might be more of an introvert. Specifically, she might seem shy around people, but it's not that, she's just more comfortable with people she knows very well, like Keith for example."
09-12-2018T01:44:56,Bgrmystr2,so she may be much more forward in her personality if she's alone with him than she would with other people around.
09-12-2018T01:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,A crowded mall - no thanks. But open and friendly at a convention kind of thing
09-12-2018T01:45:45,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, depends, usually both of those are no-gos xD"
09-12-2018T01:45:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Comfortable with like minds
09-12-2018T01:46:22,Bgrmystr2,"cuz conventions are still packed with hundreds of people one doesn't know. Maybe if you're hanging in a hotel room with a bunch of friends, then sure"
09-12-2018T01:47:32,SpazztasticKiwi,very “one person for me”
09-12-2018T01:47:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Introverted, I guess"
09-12-2018T01:48:43,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it could be partial. some people have traits of introversion without having all of em"
09-12-2018T01:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,More involved in some situations than others thing
09-12-2018T01:49:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Particularly if they’re social
09-12-2018T01:50:12,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, and I can relate to that in lots of ways. I don't mind going to public places or conventions with LOTS of people I don't know, but being the center of attention drives me up the wall and I can't do it"
09-12-2018T01:50:17,Bgrmystr2,I nope.
09-12-2018T01:50:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be much like Laura too I guess
09-12-2018T01:51:12,Bgrmystr2,"as long as I'm blending in with the crowd, I can mesh, and it's because most 99% of people don't even know you exist there. you're another face in the crowd"
09-12-2018T01:51:22,Bgrmystr2,"another brick in the wall, just like everyone else is to you, generally"
09-12-2018T01:51:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Get close to one person and unless you raise a red flag, I’m stuck"
09-12-2018T01:52:07,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know if I'd go to a convention by myself, I'd get lost easily and do very little"
09-12-2018T01:52:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m friendly socially. But as I get to know who I’m around, I’ll talk more"
09-12-2018T01:52:23,Bgrmystr2,but I really enjoy going with friends
09-12-2018T01:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cons are weird. I’ll explore, but I’ll do it in my own wonder. At East, I went up to a game and the guy there was trying to chat me up and get me to go ahead and jump in"
09-12-2018T01:54:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know you. You’re in my elbow room. I’m looking and I’ll pick up the controller when you’re not staring at me
09-12-2018T01:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"He was perfectly nice and real sweet and as I found out a fan of Jacksepticeye, whose shirt I had on. But I am hardcore closed off unless I know we have something in common"
09-12-2018T01:55:32,Bgrmystr2,"the only cons I've gone to are anime cons, so a majority of the time I talk to people trying to sell stuff"
09-12-2018T01:55:57,SpazztasticKiwi,and I didn’t know he was another fan
09-12-2018T01:56:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Thing that got me was the staring though
09-12-2018T01:59:37,SpazztasticKiwi,But I know he didn’t mean anything by it. He was just trying to be nice and helpful
09-12-2018T02:29:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I wondered if going ahead and closing it up would help actually going to bed but Bagheera’s the only one in bed
09-12-2018T03:03:07,DarthRexKing,bye.

09-12-2018T09:14:02,Twokinds,That is one of life's great mysteries.
09-12-2018T09:14:24,MrMongMong,Hm... I pray to the great Nora to give us knowledge and experience in this issue.
09-12-2018T09:14:49,MrMongMong,:ptv-left:
09-12-2018T09:15:07,CrimsonQuill,What about the Doctor? They might be able to answer.
09-12-2018T09:15:37,MrMongMong,"Nah, it's a regeneration, so it would completely change them."
09-12-2018T09:16:01,MrMongMong,Unless... Maybe regeneration will force them to stay as a female until they give birth.
09-12-2018T09:16:05,CrimsonQuill,They've handled shapeshifting before.
09-12-2018T09:16:09,iliar,Hi @CrimsonQuill. I hope I do not have to do a three-way handshake.

09-12-2018T09:19:31,CrimsonQuill,"Tom, Permission to aske a question."
09-12-2018T09:20:39,iliar,"And about suggestions. Tom, could you please not replace ""with"" -> ""\w"""
09-12-2018T09:21:28,Twokinds,my program automatically shortens all ands with & and withs with w/ in an attempt to shorten the suggestions

09-12-2018T09:23:50,Twokinds,but now that it's more like 18 it is a bit much
09-12-2018T09:24:09,iliar,"And if you use Google Translate ""w/"" create problems."
09-12-2018T09:25:02,Twokinds,alright

09-12-2018T09:28:33,CrimsonQuill,"Guys, I just need to ask something for a second. You too Tom."
09-12-2018T09:28:58,CrimsonQuill,Last night in the stream I went to bed feeling a bit...off. And I know why I felt off...
09-12-2018T09:29:28,CrimsonQuill,"Just to clarify, have I been a little...too enthusiastic or belligerant during streams lately?"
09-12-2018T09:29:47,CrimsonQuill,Because I feel like I went a little loopy over the past two weeks.
09-12-2018T09:29:58,CrimsonQuill,Or in the chat in general as a matter of fact...
09-12-2018T09:30:05,iliar,"About ""redraw my suggestion"". I will be honest. I would be glad if you do that. BUT I feel it uncomfortable."
09-12-2018T09:30:11,iliar,"Many people have never won the vote and I won several times already. It seems to me unfair to ask you to do this. Therefore, I want to clarify. You are not required to do this."

09-12-2018T10:39:45,CrimsonQuill,hi
09-12-2018T10:58:28,Twokinds,I've decided to give up coffee for a while.
09-12-2018T11:00:43,CrimsonQuill,Why?
09-12-2018T11:00:54,CrimsonQuill,Something happening to sleep?
09-12-2018T11:00:58,Twokinds,No.
09-12-2018T11:01:04,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
09-12-2018T11:01:09,Twokinds,I put a lot of sugar in my coffee.
09-12-2018T11:01:09,CrimsonQuill,So what is it?
09-12-2018T11:01:12,CrimsonQuill,Ha.
09-12-2018T11:01:14,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
09-12-2018T11:01:17,CrimsonQuill,Sugar rush?
09-12-2018T11:01:23,Twokinds,"I'm trying to cut back on sugar, but I can't stand black coffee."
09-12-2018T11:01:28,CrimsonQuill,I see.
09-12-2018T11:01:35,CrimsonQuill,Try Earl Grey.
09-12-2018T11:01:36,Twokinds,So I'm just going to stop drinking it.
09-12-2018T11:02:01,CrimsonQuill,Earl Grey Tea should see you through.
09-12-2018T11:02:09,CrimsonQuill,Or normal bog standard tea.
09-12-2018T11:02:59,Twokinds,I don't own a replicator though.
09-12-2018T11:03:40,iliar,"Have you tried adding syrup to coffee? Recently, I use this one. Delicious. https://ozon-st.cdn.ngenix.net/multimedia/c1200/1013783082.jpg"
09-12-2018T11:03:45,CrimsonQuill,Don't they sell it in the States?
09-12-2018T11:04:02,Twokinds,That would be a lot of sugar
09-12-2018T11:06:53,iliar,"I mean add syrup instead of sugar. Of course, the syrup also contains a lot of sugar. But unlike sugar, it still has a taste and a pleasant smell."
09-12-2018T11:06:54,CrimsonQuill,Do shops in the USA sell Earl Grey?
09-12-2018T11:09:23,Twokinds,I'm not much of a tea drinker but I'm sure they do.
09-12-2018T11:12:03,CrimsonQuill,I highly recommend it. It tastes glorious.

09-12-2018T11:20:42,MrMongMong,Hm. I liked the one where he shoots his clock.

09-12-2018T19:46:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah neither am I honestly, hoping to get enough money together for a wiiu eventually"
09-12-2018T19:46:42,unsteddyphoenix,Cats makes work take longer but you get soul healing

09-12-2018T19:53:49,MrMongMong,:ptv-whiny: (as in crying)
09-12-2018T19:55:15,unsteddyphoenix,Awh
09-12-2018T19:55:16,unsteddyphoenix,Poor thing
09-12-2018T20:03:22,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
09-12-2018T20:05:00,RimaDraws,hi dadro
09-12-2018T20:05:06,unsteddyphoenix,yo dad
09-12-2018T20:06:01,RimaDraws,but anyway my heart doesnt hurt so much as it did almost a year ago
09-12-2018T20:07:20,Dadrobit,Literally never buying anything from Newegg ever again. Absolutely unacceptable customer service.
09-12-2018T20:07:36,RimaDraws,oh boy
09-12-2018T20:07:37,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
09-12-2018T20:07:50,unsteddyphoenix,but the value! :O
09-12-2018T20:08:05,Dadrobit,"Sorry about the pupper Rima, emphasize entirely, still miss my childhood dogs."
09-12-2018T20:08:19,RimaDraws,he wasn't my childhood doggo
09-12-2018T20:08:24,RimaDraws,i only had him five years
09-12-2018T20:08:38,RimaDraws,a very short time
09-12-2018T20:09:05,Dadrobit,"What value? Almost two weeks to arrive on a one week shipping, then the system has a fatal crash in only a few days and gets a dead pixel in the center of the screen to boot?"
09-12-2018T20:10:02,unsteddyphoenix,Oof. This your laptop?
09-12-2018T20:11:42,Dadrobit,"And customer ""support"" is actually nonexistent. Multiple times put on hold for hours, only to be disconnected. Both on the phone and computer. Fucking waiting in line ""You are number 372"" only to get ""sorry there was an issue, please try again"" 2 hours in"
09-12-2018T20:12:19,Bgrmystr2,it is december..
09-12-2018T20:12:28,Dadrobit,"All. Fucking. Day. I have been trying to get in touch with ANYBODY only to get ""errors"" and ""disconnects""."
09-12-2018T20:13:20,Bgrmystr2,"you'd think you're the only one on the customer support during the massive christmas rush which probably bogged their support servers, if not crashed them outright"
09-12-2018T20:13:39,Bgrmystr2,what company doesn't have this shit happen every single year right before christmas? lol
09-12-2018T20:13:54,Dadrobit,I get that it's December. Obviously they forgot to at least hire temps. It being December does not fucking forgive them for not providing ANYTHING after 11 hours of nonstop attempts?
09-12-2018T20:13:56,unsteddyphoenix,They should hire temp then around this time
09-12-2018T20:14:44,Dadrobit,I get being on hold for a few hours. But for literally half a fucking day?
09-12-2018T20:14:56,Dadrobit,Pardon my language. I am a bit miffed.
09-12-2018T20:14:59,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think a few temps will even remotely change much. 5? 7? 10? When they likely have hundreds of claims, it's just a drop in the bucket."
09-12-2018T20:15:58,Bgrmystr2,I've long since given up ever getting any customer service ever during the entire December month for any company that sells a product.
09-12-2018T20:16:28,Dadrobit,That's why you have things like business analysts that calculate how many temps you need to hire. It's not like Newegg is some tiny indie company.
09-12-2018T20:17:38,Bgrmystr2,"Course not, but are they gonna go out and hire a couple hundred temps just to handle the massive demand for customer support? xD"
09-12-2018T20:17:52,unsteddyphoenix,Um.
09-12-2018T20:17:55,Dadrobit,Yes
09-12-2018T20:18:02,Dadrobit,That is literally what they should do
09-12-2018T20:18:19,unsteddyphoenix,Fun fact people can answer more than one phone per work day
09-12-2018T20:18:25,unsteddyphoenix,So they probably wouldnt need 100 temps
09-12-2018T20:18:44,Bgrmystr2,"I think you highly underestimate the sheer amount of orders people make, phoenix lol"
09-12-2018T20:19:02,Dadrobit,I got put into line at around 200-300 each time I tried to reconnect
09-12-2018T20:19:04,unsteddyphoenix,I think you might be slightly over
09-12-2018T20:19:06,unsteddyphoenix,Just slightly
09-12-2018T20:19:28,Dadrobit,Currently sitting at 39. But I've seen as low as 26
09-12-2018T20:22:51,Bgrmystr2,"yeah 200 people sitting in line on top of everyone they're already taking care of, even if it were only 5mins. it would take one person 16.6 hours to go through 200 people. And those calls take what, anywhere from 20-40mins if it's quick?"
09-12-2018T20:23:06,Dadrobit,What?
09-12-2018T20:23:45,Dadrobit,"Oh, one person"
09-12-2018T20:23:56,Dadrobit,So get 20 teps
09-12-2018T20:23:59,Dadrobit,temps
09-12-2018T20:24:41,Dadrobit,And 20-40 minutes is way too long once you're actually in with a person.
09-12-2018T20:25:12,Bgrmystr2,is it?
09-12-2018T20:25:19,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
09-12-2018T20:25:25,Dadrobit,5-10 minutes unless you're talking about calling for health insurance.
09-12-2018T20:26:33,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know any customer service phonecalls that didn't take less than 20 mins, in fact, most of em would take 35-40 mins or longer, and that's not just my experience either."
09-12-2018T20:26:42,Dadrobit,"""What did you order"" ""Here's my order number. It's broken."" Is it under warranty?"" ""Yes"" ""We'll send you a return box and send you a new one."""
09-12-2018T20:26:50,Bgrmystr2,ignoring when you're sitting on the phone for hours with someone
09-12-2018T20:26:55,Bgrmystr2,cuz those aren't normal
09-12-2018T20:27:26,Bgrmystr2,lol dadro if only that were the case. xD
09-12-2018T20:27:40,Bgrmystr2,for all that I can just put an RMA which requires zero person interaction.
09-12-2018T20:27:50,Dadrobit,It is the case. This isn't my first rodeo in dealing with lemon laptops.
09-12-2018T20:28:29,Bgrmystr2,"Not to me, I've never had that nor heard of it. That's like some happy christmas movie miracle shit in my eyes lol"
09-12-2018T20:28:41,Dadrobit,That's the issue isn't it. The website RMA link is dead. Or else I would have already gone and done that.
09-12-2018T20:29:09,Bgrmystr2,wot
09-12-2018T20:29:15,Bgrmystr2,how is the link dead
09-12-2018T20:31:59,Dadrobit,"It links me to ""Ineligible for return."" Which is 100% Grade A+ Horse Shit."
09-12-2018T20:33:22,Dadrobit,"""For purchases placed between November 1, 2018 and December 24, 2018 you will have until January 31, 2019 to return your product. There's nothing additional that you have to do! """

09-12-2018T23:02:29,Twokinds,I was just tired
09-12-2018T23:02:42,Twokinds,Quit coffee
09-12-2018T23:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh no
09-12-2018T23:03:31,SpazztasticKiwi,How’re you gonna survive to the new year
09-12-2018T23:04:35,Ordithus,That will do you in for a while.  Cold turkey?
09-12-2018T23:04:41,Twokinds,Yeah
09-12-2018T23:04:59,Twokinds,"Though after a day, I think I want coffee tomorrow"
09-12-2018T23:05:04,Ordithus,At least a few days.  Drink lots of water
09-12-2018T23:05:16,Twokinds,lol
09-12-2018T23:05:25,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re gonna quit so easy? Tsk tsk
09-12-2018T23:05:38,Twokinds,Nha
09-12-2018T23:05:54,Twokinds,But it's definitely taking a toll
09-12-2018T23:06:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I cut drinking so much coke
09-12-2018T23:06:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And as much sugar as I could
09-12-2018T23:06:40,Twokinds,That's why I quit coffee
09-12-2018T23:06:48,Twokinds,Cut as much sugar as possible
09-12-2018T23:06:54,Twokinds,But I can't stand black coffee
09-12-2018T23:07:00,Twokinds,So cold turkey is better
09-12-2018T23:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t drink it with sugar then
09-12-2018T23:07:12,Ordithus,Black is just about the only way I drink coffee
09-12-2018T23:07:13,Ordithus,Love it
09-12-2018T23:07:22,Twokinds,It tastes so bad
09-12-2018T23:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t find it that bad
09-12-2018T23:07:48,Ordithus,"That's a personal problem, Tom"
09-12-2018T23:07:59,SpazztasticKiwi,But then again I’m just about as bitter
09-12-2018T23:08:06,QuinnMalachite,not even milk
09-12-2018T23:08:12,QuinnMalachite,*has no idea how to coffee*
09-12-2018T23:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope
09-12-2018T23:08:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I sometimes add creamer. But I’m more likely to use creamer than sugar in coffee
09-12-2018T23:08:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"With my tea, I keep straight"
09-12-2018T23:08:55,Ordithus,Then again I do tend to drink pretty good coffee.
09-12-2018T23:08:56,SpazztasticKiwi,No even honey
09-12-2018T23:13:12,RimaDraws,i hate black coffee
09-12-2018T23:20:34,unsteddyphoenix,Blacks alright
09-12-2018T23:21:07,unsteddyphoenix,Putting some honey in is an idea
09-12-2018T23:21:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I was talking honey in tea
09-12-2018T23:22:34,unsteddyphoenix,Try it with coffee yolo
09-12-2018T23:22:39,Ordithus,Cafe miel uses honey as a sweetener
09-12-2018T23:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway Tom - if it’s you wanting to be productive, make your bed or something"
09-12-2018T23:22:47,RimaDraws,ewww honey in black coffee'
09-12-2018T23:22:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Boom - accomplishment
