03-03-2018T14:53:43,TheArtApprentice,"Never mind In can always buy another one or even a better one the the one Tom has, I had the starter kit one of the small tablets I had returned it because its sensitivety was so high I couldn't do a thing but scribble later"
03-03-2018T14:55:03,TheArtApprentice,"after I had bought the graphics card I realized It had a sensitivity settings in it, at the time I thought to myself I was an idiot but  all my games relay on a good graphics card so I didnt complain"
03-03-2018T14:55:50,Combak,"Nah, it might make you a bit of a dick but it sounds like things worked out."

03-03-2018T16:49:25,ZephyrTWolffox,Maybe Mark when he was younger.

03-03-2018T16:50:03,DragonKnightAdam,just the fact that there is a furry community to tag to start with
03-03-2018T16:50:04,FenceEqualizer,Mark Hanmill as trace....I never knew I wanted this
03-03-2018T16:50:05,Dadrobit,And Mark Hamill is way too hella old

03-03-2018T16:52:30,CamtheGamerMan,Really I'd think Markiplier would be a good voice for trace. Really if tom decided to make one of those voice over comic reading videos for twokinds he'd probably do it
03-03-2018T16:52:34,BluePhantom90,heh I would have laughed more if Zen had some stars around him when Kat sees him

03-03-2018T16:53:07,ZephyrTWolffox,would sound even more like an old man.
03-03-2018T16:53:10,ThingsAreMoving,Trace obviously would need to be voiced by Arnold Shwarzenegger
03-03-2018T16:53:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,Maybe we should do a request where a bunch of famous actors are auditioning for the role of VAs for the characters and the TwoKinds cast are judging who would be best to be their voices.

03-03-2018T16:53:30,TorqueEmUp,I don't know too many actors that actually train their voice for different roles.

03-03-2018T17:10:20,FenceEqualizer,Who goes to Taco Bell for Mexican food!? You go to tacobell specifically for tacobell food
03-03-2018T17:10:21,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, Mvilu"
03-03-2018T17:10:26,Bgrmystr2,so why would they not drink tea?

03-03-2018T17:10:41,TheFDdriver,witch brew is prob monster energy
03-03-2018T17:10:51,Lolidesubearswag,Not as much overwhelming power I suppose

03-03-2018T17:12:06,TheBeckoner,"Instant is like a distant ghost cousin to real coffee, not even the same category of drink as far as coffee goes, yo expect something unlike coffee when you drink it. Or atleast I do.."
03-03-2018T17:12:09,FenceEqualizer,&gt;.&gt; I want some tacobell now

03-03-2018T17:12:43,Bgrmystr2,It teleported Flora before.
03-03-2018T17:12:45,Bgrmystr2,and Nibbly
03-03-2018T17:12:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I just don't like Coffee
03-03-2018T17:12:49,Bgrmystr2,and another squirrel

03-03-2018T17:13:09,bacon683,red bull is better than coffee
03-03-2018T17:13:10,ZephyrTWolffox,the solution is simple.  Give me all your coffee
03-03-2018T17:13:11,CrRAR,it brings eeet
03-03-2018T17:13:19,Dadrobit,And a dragon iirc
03-03-2018T17:13:29,ThingsAreMoving,Basitin has coffee if you have coin
03-03-2018T17:13:35,TorqueEmUp,Because you are having a caffine withdraw because you started drinking coffee in the first place. :P
03-03-2018T17:13:42,ZephyrTWolffox,Do they take Gil?
03-03-2018T17:13:45,MviluUatusun,"You can have all the coffee that was grown for me to drink, Zephyr."
03-03-2018T17:13:48,Bgrmystr2,"Dadro, I'm fairly sure noone has ever requested Laura to come from the table."
03-03-2018T17:13:54,Dadrobit,I did

03-03-2018T20:10:53,BadFoMo,*?
03-03-2018T20:10:56,ThingsAreMoving,isn't that exciting
03-03-2018T20:10:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yeet

03-03-2018T20:11:40,unsteddyphoenix,Eventually someone will have to make a daniels-37 timeline
03-03-2018T20:11:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,get neon to do it
03-03-2018T20:11:57,Dadrobit,"37 probably needs to be filled with more than ""detirmination"" to have two kids before Flora"
03-03-2018T20:12:16,Neverborn,"@ Tom, would you mind posting the chained up dragon sketch somewhere?  i only ever saw a flash of it, and wanted a better look."
03-03-2018T20:12:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"They’re already all over each other behind trees. I think if that sketch was drawn with about an hour or so time advancement, we’d be needing some convenient tree branches"
03-03-2018T20:12:44,Twokinds,That's a Nora Card it's in progress

03-03-2018T20:14:19,ThingsAreMoving,Maybe it's not just the power that grows with age in dragons

03-03-2018T20:18:09,Combak,"Seriously, @Twokinds, was the Human Nora, Trace, and Flora piece a canceled Nora card or something?"
03-03-2018T20:18:25,ThingsAreMoving,Also if Dragons in Twokinds are made of magic then maybe the don't need males to procreate
03-03-2018T20:19:15,unsteddyphoenix,Its already confirmed they can procreate with the other races
03-03-2018T20:19:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,too op pls nef

03-03-2018T20:21:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s more of an idea for different dragon characters

03-03-2018T20:25:45,TheBeckoner,Amazing
03-03-2018T20:27:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nibs is a young dragon. As younglings, dragons have no gender or official form - their purpose is to mimic life and learn about the world. At a certain age, they transform (molt?) into their dragon form"
03-03-2018T20:27:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't dads voice can go that high for velociraptor noises
03-03-2018T20:27:50,SpazztasticKiwi,My current theory
03-03-2018T20:28:02,unsteddyphoenix,i can see that
03-03-2018T20:28:33,TheBeckoner,More of throat type noise less of a vocal cord noise I think
03-03-2018T20:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"It explains why nibs can’t or doesn’t talk - either no on speaks squirrell (and really, who does?) or little Nib can’t talk yet cause they’re a baby"
03-03-2018T20:29:27,unsteddyphoenix,I bet a dragon would be fine after being flung against a tree....

03-03-2018T20:49:04,Dadrobit,I give you 50-65 years to live
03-03-2018T20:49:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Yoga is like parallel parking, you back up until you hear glass break and people screaming, then go 3 more feet"

03-03-2018T21:25:54,Bgrmystr2,I know better
03-03-2018T21:26:00,Dadrobit,Slash endless days
03-03-2018T21:26:14,Bgrmystr2,"I knew before I met him, honestly"
03-03-2018T21:26:18,TheBeckoner,I think the endless days thing would be neat for a while.
03-03-2018T21:26:29,Bgrmystr2,yeah
03-03-2018T21:26:33,Bgrmystr2,then you'd have endless nights
03-03-2018T21:26:41,Bgrmystr2,and then go back to endless days
03-03-2018T21:26:46,TheBeckoner,That would be cool to experience too.
03-03-2018T21:27:05,TheBeckoner,Endless days = Immortal?!?!
03-03-2018T21:27:07,TheBeckoner,Im in
03-03-2018T21:27:10,Bgrmystr2,"cool to experience, not sure if you'd want to live in it though"
03-03-2018T21:27:40,Bgrmystr2,inconvenient for most ppl since nighttime is dark and hard to see
03-03-2018T21:27:44,TheBeckoner,If I'm ever incredibly well off a vacation home there would be cool.
03-03-2018T21:28:00,Bgrmystr2,yeah probably
03-03-2018T21:28:38,Bgrmystr2,"I think if I ever get a vacation home, one of the places I'm interested in is this island off the southern coast of Georgia"
03-03-2018T21:29:01,Bgrmystr2,"nice place, lotta rich people have estates there, from what I've been told"
03-03-2018T21:29:20,TheBeckoner,What is the island?
03-03-2018T21:29:38,Dadrobit,brb
03-03-2018T21:29:57,TheBeckoner,I need a haircut...too long
03-03-2018T21:30:19,Bgrmystr2,Cumberland Island
03-03-2018T21:30:21,TheBeckoner,"Wind: ""I will place all of your hairs on your eyes. You want them there right?"""
03-03-2018T21:30:24,TorqueEmUp,get a haircut you stupid hippy!
03-03-2018T21:30:26,TorqueEmUp,:P
03-03-2018T21:30:44,TorqueEmUp,jk jk
03-03-2018T21:30:54,Bgrmystr2,"It's basically covering the southern shore of GA, which is why the naval base is there too"
03-03-2018T21:31:00,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's protected
03-03-2018T21:31:05,Bgrmystr2,"barrier island, and all that."
03-03-2018T21:31:32,TheBeckoner,Seems nice from the pictures.
03-03-2018T21:31:39,TheBeckoner,Lots of wild horses?
03-03-2018T21:31:57,TheBeckoner,Also I am terribly offended Torque. /s
03-03-2018T21:33:07,Bgrmystr2,I've been to the ruins on Cumberland Island
03-03-2018T21:33:09,Bgrmystr2,when I was a kid
03-03-2018T21:33:15,Bgrmystr2,school field trip
03-03-2018T21:33:18,Bgrmystr2,it was cool
03-03-2018T21:33:21,Bgrmystr2,lotta bugs
03-03-2018T21:33:32,Bgrmystr2,don't remember a whole lot about it... but it was neat nonetheless.
03-03-2018T21:33:39,TheBeckoner,I like bugs
03-03-2018T21:33:42,TheBeckoner,they stick
03-03-2018T21:33:45,TheBeckoner,thats the best part
03-03-2018T21:33:51,Bgrmystr2,Mosquitos and stuff are not fun
03-03-2018T21:33:54,TheBeckoner,Nope
03-03-2018T21:33:59,Bgrmystr2,that's the kinda bugs they had
03-03-2018T21:34:03,Bgrmystr2,the not-fun kind
03-03-2018T21:34:07,TheBeckoner,I mainly meant beetles
03-03-2018T21:34:17,TheBeckoner,Like june bugs
03-03-2018T21:34:24,TheBeckoner,which come in august...
03-03-2018T21:35:35,Bgrmystr2,ahh
03-03-2018T21:35:36,Bgrmystr2,Dunno
03-03-2018T21:35:45,Bgrmystr2,I was mostly worried about the flying bugs that bit you
03-03-2018T21:35:47,Bgrmystr2,:/
03-03-2018T21:37:04,Bgrmystr2,"The place was nice, though"
03-03-2018T21:37:07,Bgrmystr2,"to live in, I mean"
03-03-2018T21:37:16,Bgrmystr2,Lotta years of my life down there
03-03-2018T21:38:07,TheBeckoner,I've lived in the same place for my whole life. Well i moved once but that doesnt really count as a change since it was only an hour away
03-03-2018T21:38:13,Bgrmystr2,12 years I guess.
03-03-2018T21:38:25,Bgrmystr2,"Huh, not as long as I recall it being, but I guess being young does that to ya"
03-03-2018T21:38:28,TheBeckoner,I'd like to travel the US some day...
03-03-2018T21:38:49,Bgrmystr2,"Same, lotta places I wanna visit"
03-03-2018T21:39:10,TheBeckoner,I would really like to see Boston
03-03-2018T21:39:17,Bgrmystr2,I've been there
03-03-2018T21:39:28,Bgrmystr2,maybe once in Boston proper?
03-03-2018T21:39:39,TheBeckoner,Were you young?
03-03-2018T21:39:42,Bgrmystr2,Mother's family is from up there
03-03-2018T21:39:44,Bgrmystr2,yeah
03-03-2018T21:39:55,Bgrmystr2,so I don't recall it very well :(
03-03-2018T21:39:59,Bgrmystr2,and it wasn't recent
03-03-2018T21:40:22,Bgrmystr2,likely more than 16 years ago
03-03-2018T21:40:33,TheBeckoner,Yeah My family is from France and Russia originally. So I don't have any US based histoty I can go back and look at where family lived.
03-03-2018T21:40:47,Bgrmystr2,I would have been.. mid teens I guess?
03-03-2018T21:41:05,Bgrmystr2,Ahh
03-03-2018T21:41:11,TheBeckoner,Assuming you are 30 something or almost 30

03-03-2018T21:42:02,TheBeckoner,"Bah never feel old, just age"
03-03-2018T21:42:26,TheBeckoner,My goal is to make it to 2100
03-03-2018T21:42:35,TheBeckoner,If I can...
03-03-2018T21:42:48,Bgrmystr2,"My mother's side came from Methuen, which is not too far from Boston."
03-03-2018T21:42:58,Bgrmystr2,My Father's from here in Orleans
03-03-2018T21:43:21,Bgrmystr2,so I can safely say I've been to both
03-03-2018T21:43:44,Bgrmystr2,"Me, I just wanna travel"
03-03-2018T21:43:57,Bgrmystr2,"I wanna visit New York, wanna visit the salt flats"

03-03-2018T21:44:27,Bgrmystr2,"Won't be my first time, but will be the first time I remember"
03-03-2018T21:44:37,Bgrmystr2,I wanna go visit the needle in Seattle
03-03-2018T21:45:06,TheBeckoner,"I've been to New Orleans before. Only in passing though. Ive been to South carolina, mississippi, Alabama georgia and tennessee I believe..."
03-03-2018T21:45:17,TheBeckoner,Too me  a second to remember.
03-03-2018T21:45:37,TheBeckoner,Bonneville salt flats?
03-03-2018T21:45:45,TheBeckoner,I'd like to go there too sometime
03-03-2018T21:45:52,Bgrmystr2,NYC is prettymuch the city I'm going to see for like.. the skyscrapers and the hustle+bustle of city of concrete
03-03-2018T21:45:54,TheBeckoner,New york would be cool as well
03-03-2018T21:46:05,TheBeckoner,Same
03-03-2018T21:46:11,TheBeckoner,Real city life
03-03-2018T21:46:12,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah, the Bonneville salt flats"
03-03-2018T21:46:21,TheBeckoner,I wanna race there someday
03-03-2018T21:46:27,Bgrmystr2,"haha, right"
03-03-2018T21:46:33,TheBeckoner,Maybe join the 200mph club
03-03-2018T21:46:36,TheBeckoner,hah
03-03-2018T21:46:42,TheBeckoner,probably not
03-03-2018T21:46:52,Bgrmystr2,"with a proper setup, maybe?"
03-03-2018T21:47:00,Bgrmystr2,some cars just won't do it
03-03-2018T21:47:12,TheBeckoner,Eh We are building a 67 Nova that may be capable
03-03-2018T21:47:18,Bgrmystr2,then there ya go
03-03-2018T21:47:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,forced induction is a magic but terrifying thing
03-03-2018T21:47:33,TheBeckoner,Turbo LS ftw
03-03-2018T21:47:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sweet
03-03-2018T21:48:06,TheBeckoner,Id really like to do a truck though. Pay tribute to my first truck sorta deal.
03-03-2018T21:48:31,Bgrmystr2,"I know what vehicle I want to drive one day. Can't pay for it now, but.. one day"
03-03-2018T21:48:36,Bgrmystr2,and it's not even expensive
03-03-2018T21:48:41,Bgrmystr2,so I'll definitely have it
03-03-2018T21:48:45,TheBeckoner,what is it?
03-03-2018T21:48:56,Bgrmystr2,a 1970 El Camino 454 SS
03-03-2018T21:49:02,TheBeckoner,Aw hell yeah
03-03-2018T21:49:02,Bgrmystr2,Fuckin.. car truck thing
03-03-2018T21:49:10,TheBeckoner,I love the Elcos
03-03-2018T21:49:25,TheBeckoner,Specially the 70's chevelle like ones.
03-03-2018T21:49:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the hermaphrodite of automobiles?
03-03-2018T21:49:45,TheBeckoner,Good way to put it I suppose
03-03-2018T21:49:51,Bgrmystr2,"I was never big on cars in general, though I like musclecars somewhat.. and I like the benefits of a truck, but it's a workhorse, it's not fun"
03-03-2018T21:49:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that was from Archer
03-03-2018T21:49:56,Bgrmystr2,the El Camino is both
03-03-2018T21:50:07,TheBeckoner,Didnt know that Marv.
03-03-2018T21:50:35,Bgrmystr2,the 70s use a lot of the same body as the Chevelle yeah
03-03-2018T21:50:48,Bgrmystr2,so they're relatively easy to get replacement parts
03-03-2018T21:50:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,also Bgr pls do get one so you can say you have a El camino full of rampage
03-03-2018T21:50:57,TheBeckoner,Dime a dozen parts-wise
03-03-2018T21:51:02,Bgrmystr2,lool marv

03-03-2018T21:51:41,Bgrmystr2,one day

03-03-2018T21:54:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"1st gen super, they became their own thing in 1986"
03-03-2018T21:54:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,before they were Celicas
03-03-2018T21:54:20,TheBeckoner,"I will remember the car you have/like forever, though I may forget your name."
03-03-2018T21:54:24,TheBeckoner,Ahh thats right

03-03-2018T21:57:12,Bgrmystr2,I hope before I buy the thing that I'll know more about cars than I know now
03-03-2018T21:57:57,TheBeckoner,Just buy it. You'll learn fast.
03-03-2018T21:58:06,Bgrmystr2,that requires money
03-03-2018T21:58:08,TheBeckoner,That's what I did with my truck.
03-03-2018T21:58:10,TheBeckoner,True
03-03-2018T21:58:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"older cars like that, just fallow the gas"
03-03-2018T21:58:40,Bgrmystr2,"I'm bad at braking, and I'd probably be horrible with a stick, though I wouldn't mind learning it"
03-03-2018T21:58:47,TheBeckoner,"""wanna stop at burger king?"" ""Uhhh I figured we could eat at this gas station?"""
03-03-2018T21:58:54,Bgrmystr2,I'm just gonna end up having to replace a few gearboxes learning stick XD

03-03-2018T22:00:34,TheBeckoner,I like autos for boost keeping.
03-03-2018T22:00:40,Bgrmystr2,"I'd still want to learn w/ the clutch, even if I drive daily without one"
03-03-2018T22:01:05,TheBeckoner,It's pretty fun once you get a hang of it
03-03-2018T22:01:08,TheBeckoner,the*

03-03-2018T22:03:34,Twokinds,"If I was forced to, I could probably figure it out again, but it'd take some time."
03-03-2018T22:03:55,TheBeckoner,Initial D is pretty good imo
03-03-2018T22:04:16,TheBeckoner,You have an accord right Tom? or a honda of some sort?
03-03-2018T22:04:18,Twokinds,I get the basic principles.
03-03-2018T22:04:22,Bgrmystr2,"tis what I wanna do is get that truck, learn to drive it, then learn how drifting setups work and learn to drift with it too"
03-03-2018T22:04:33,Bgrmystr2,cuz I always enjoyed driving games

03-03-2018T22:07:15,Twokinds,"Yeah not a coupe, I assume. I don't know what that is but it doesn't sound familiar."
03-03-2018T22:07:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"honda civics are great cars tho, last forever"
03-03-2018T22:07:19,TheBeckoner,Last time Tom talked on stream he answered a couple questions about his car
03-03-2018T22:07:31,TheBeckoner,You got a sedan Tomo
03-03-2018T22:07:37,unsteddyphoenix,You cant remember how many doors your car has?
03-03-2018T22:08:19,TheBeckoner,"""5 if you count the trunk"""
03-03-2018T22:08:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Its funny you got people like Tom who can't remember how many doors, then you get people like me who can remember the piston firing order on his small block chevy"
03-03-2018T22:08:35,TheBeckoner,^^^
03-03-2018T22:08:46,TheBeckoner,Diametric indeed.

03-03-2018T22:09:15,TheBeckoner,The Chevy I6 is 162534 iirc
03-03-2018T22:09:38,unsteddyphoenix,Knowing that thing and not knowing your own car doors is on the same level of weird.
03-03-2018T22:10:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"bgr those tell you what piston fires first, like 1 goes then 8, and so on"
03-03-2018T22:10:10,Twokinds,Does Sedan mean four doors?
03-03-2018T22:10:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
03-03-2018T22:10:17,TheBeckoner,yee
03-03-2018T22:10:17,Twokinds,Ah! I see
03-03-2018T22:10:33,TheBeckoner,Now...does it have tires?
03-03-2018T22:10:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,coupe is usually a 2 door sport
03-03-2018T22:10:34,Twokinds,"I've heard the word, but I've never actually looked into what it meant exactly."
03-03-2018T22:10:44,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, a coupe is 2 door"
03-03-2018T22:10:47,unsteddyphoenix,I thought it was a brand
03-03-2018T22:11:01,TheBeckoner,Hatchback means sharp pointy 2 door
03-03-2018T22:11:16,Twokinds,I'm at a disadvantage with cars because I've never had to buy one
03-03-2018T22:11:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"sedan and saloon and the same thing, 4 door car"
03-03-2018T22:11:24,Twokinds,So I've never taken the time to research them at all.
03-03-2018T22:11:40,TheBeckoner,"It's ok, you have a Honda. You wont ever have to."
03-03-2018T22:11:43,unsteddyphoenix,I just...dont care about cars.
03-03-2018T22:11:48,TheBeckoner,Sinner

03-03-2018T22:12:10,Bgrmystr2,yes phoenix

03-03-2018T22:12:15,Twokinds,It's a 2013 so I expect it to last for a fair amount of time.
03-03-2018T22:12:15,Bgrmystr2,long as you bring your phone.
03-03-2018T22:12:16,TheBeckoner,In any car really
03-03-2018T22:12:21,unsteddyphoenix,Thats pretty good. I want that one.
03-03-2018T22:12:21,Bgrmystr2,shutup beck
03-03-2018T22:12:27,Twokinds,It'll probably fall apart more from disuse than anything else.
03-03-2018T22:12:30,Bgrmystr2,don't ruin his illusion
03-03-2018T22:12:30,TheBeckoner,lol

03-03-2018T22:13:16,TheBeckoner,give it treats

03-03-2018T22:14:25,unsteddyphoenix,It really works!
03-03-2018T22:14:27,Bgrmystr2,more often when I was young so they didn't want me to touch anything lol

03-03-2018T22:14:35,Twokinds,I had to do that so many times with my old car. What a pain.
03-03-2018T22:14:41,Twokinds,That thing's battery died constantly.
03-03-2018T22:14:56,Twokinds,And you had to take off the front left wheel to change it.
03-03-2018T22:14:59,TheBeckoner,Probably needed a new batt or alternator
03-03-2018T22:15:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds like a draw issue with the car
03-03-2018T22:15:10,TheBeckoner,Oh dang
