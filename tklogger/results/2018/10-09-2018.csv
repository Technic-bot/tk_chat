10-09-2018T00:01:18,unsteddyphoenix,Colin is beaitiful just the way he is!
10-09-2018T00:01:31,Bgrmystr2,"that is BIG floof, kiwi"
10-09-2018T00:02:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanna pet big floof
10-09-2018T00:03:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but I still think it could have lead to some interesting subplots revolving around him being a ""breed"" that is often seen as scary from people immediately judging him, when in fact he is a big sweetheart."
10-09-2018T00:03:59,Dadrobit,Alas and alak
10-09-2018T00:04:10,Dadrobit,alack*
10-09-2018T00:05:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Im sure there wont be a lack of systemic racism themes, dont worry~"
10-09-2018T00:05:32,Dadrobit,"I mean, it'd just be another layer"
10-09-2018T00:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t fuss if your large dog comes bouncing over to me for pets. If I get taken out by a 100 pound ball of fluff I’ll persevere
10-09-2018T00:06:51,unsteddyphoenix,What a way to go~
10-09-2018T00:07:02,unsteddyphoenix,Perhaps one layer too many! :O
10-09-2018T00:07:11,SpazztasticKiwi,All the layers
10-09-2018T00:07:12,Dadrobit,Colins are like onions
10-09-2018T00:07:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Symbolism abound
10-09-2018T00:07:27,Bgrmystr2,they're sweet and delicious?
10-09-2018T00:07:29,Bgrmystr2,"wait, that's cakes"
10-09-2018T00:07:29,unsteddyphoenix,Im guessing people will be spooked by him anyway since he's a goddamn giant
10-09-2018T00:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,He gets married and his wife gotta climb on a chair to see his face
10-09-2018T00:09:00,SpazztasticKiwi,What a way to stop arguments though
10-09-2018T00:09:06,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like sam and Colin is going to inevitably arrive at Sam riding on Colins shoulders to get around
10-09-2018T00:09:26,Bgrmystr2,xD
10-09-2018T00:09:40,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly probably easier for them to hold a conversation that way than them walking next to each other
10-09-2018T00:09:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“I can see my house from here!”
10-09-2018T00:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,“We’re picking apples in your backyard”
10-09-2018T00:09:58,Dadrobit,I feel like the opposite would be funnier. Sam getting a bit too overzealous at a party and trying to carry him.
10-09-2018T00:10:45,Dadrobit,*Cue Clown Music*
10-09-2018T00:11:05,unsteddyphoenix,can only end in disaster for everyone
10-09-2018T00:11:09,unsteddyphoenix,Im in
10-09-2018T00:11:45,SpazztasticKiwi,“The risk I took was calculated but man am I bad at math”
10-09-2018T00:12:40,Bgrmystr2,haha
10-09-2018T00:13:16,Bgrmystr2,"no offense to sam, but I don't think she'd be able to even get him off the ground"
10-09-2018T00:14:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Uh, yeah."
10-09-2018T00:14:19,Dadrobit,"Nah, Conlin is 85% floof, mostly air."
10-09-2018T00:14:26,Dadrobit,Colin*
10-09-2018T00:14:27,unsteddyphoenix,She should probably start with bench pressing balloons and go from there
10-09-2018T00:14:48,Bgrmystr2,mhmmm..
10-09-2018T00:14:48,unsteddyphoenix,Unless she has tiny girl anime strength
10-09-2018T00:14:57,Dadrobit,Probably that
10-09-2018T00:15:11,Bgrmystr2,colin's a big dog.
10-09-2018T00:15:21,unsteddyphoenix,for her
10-09-2018T00:15:24,unsteddyphoenix,(sorry)
10-09-2018T00:15:55,Bgrmystr2,'s a lotta weight to be lifting even when sober. When drunk? Coordination goes to shit.
10-09-2018T00:17:03,unsteddyphoenix,Very true.
10-09-2018T00:17:26,unsteddyphoenix,Ever tried to fight anyone while drunk?
10-09-2018T00:17:40,unsteddyphoenix,I probably couldnt have hurt a fly
10-09-2018T00:17:58,Bgrmystr2,"Not personally, but I've seen it."
10-09-2018T00:18:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but for some folks, dulling their senses makes them go that much harder."
10-09-2018T00:18:24,Bgrmystr2,if you could punch a gutterball.. yeah
10-09-2018T00:19:44,SpazztasticKiwi,“Fight meh!”
10-09-2018T00:20:01,SpazztasticKiwi,“You’re not even facing me”
10-09-2018T00:20:17,unsteddyphoenix,Luckily I dont know any of those peopel
10-09-2018T00:20:24,unsteddyphoenix,"Also, ^me"
10-09-2018T00:20:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen a vid of two drunk elderly men fighting
10-09-2018T00:20:56,SpazztasticKiwi,So entertaining since they were throwing punches five feet apart
10-09-2018T00:21:07,Bgrmystr2,Basically.. every drunk fight I've seen has been like watching people pin the tail on the donkey.. but instead attempting to pin the first to the other one's face.
10-09-2018T00:21:11,Bgrmystr2,didn't work.
10-09-2018T00:21:32,Bgrmystr2,fist*
10-09-2018T00:21:36,Bgrmystr2,ffs r go away
10-09-2018T00:21:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Also seen a drunk guy pick a fight with a black belt holder
10-09-2018T00:22:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Lasted one kick
10-09-2018T00:22:14,Bgrmystr2,drunk guy vs wall.
10-09-2018T00:22:15,Bgrmystr2,:v
10-09-2018T00:22:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunk guy vs mirror
10-09-2018T00:22:32,Bgrmystr2,haha
10-09-2018T00:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,*drunk
10-09-2018T00:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"That, I’d like to see though I’m sure it’s happened"
10-09-2018T00:23:10,Bgrmystr2,"hey, if he gets a solid hit in.. so does the mirror"
10-09-2018T00:23:30,SpazztasticKiwi,“Thank God I don’t have to look at you anymore”
10-09-2018T00:23:47,Bgrmystr2,xD mirror would do a number on his fist though
10-09-2018T00:23:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve also seen a drunk guy wee on an electric fence
10-09-2018T00:24:06,Bgrmystr2,bet that worked out well for him
10-09-2018T00:24:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t have to manscape after
10-09-2018T00:24:28,Bgrmystr2,xD
10-09-2018T00:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope it made him sterile
10-09-2018T00:24:57,unsteddyphoenix,Free manscaping AND no kids?
10-09-2018T00:25:00,unsteddyphoenix,Stop making that sound good
10-09-2018T00:25:24,Bgrmystr2,"xDD phoenix no, you don't need to do that"
10-09-2018T00:25:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean
10-09-2018T00:25:53,unsteddyphoenix,But...so efficient.
10-09-2018T00:25:58,SpazztasticKiwi,If you’re sterile you don’t need condoms when you marry
10-09-2018T00:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Just while you’re still single
10-09-2018T00:27:01,unsteddyphoenix,exactly~
10-09-2018T00:29:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothing like bullets with no gunpowder
10-09-2018T00:30:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Ironic, since both bullets and kids will end your life! :D"

10-09-2018T02:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,That still sounds like it could be either one
10-09-2018T02:30:19,unsteddyphoenix,As the old adage goes: sometimes a :ctwokinds-kingtea: is just a :ctwokinds-kingtea:

10-09-2018T02:44:52,Twokinds,Morning equivilent of twilight
10-09-2018T02:45:05,Dadrobit,Dawn?
10-09-2018T02:45:25,unsteddyphoenix,Is that... also twilight?
10-09-2018T02:45:54,unsteddyphoenix,"I think dusk and dawn is both ""twilight"""
10-09-2018T02:46:17,Dadrobit,Definition of twilight 1 : the light from the sky between full night and sunrise or between sunset and full night produced by diffusion of sunlight through the atmosphere and its dust

10-09-2018T16:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,“You look awful small/young for your age” is not exactly a compliment
10-09-2018T16:16:02,SpazztasticKiwi,So in what universe would it make sense to comment someone looks “shrimpy”
