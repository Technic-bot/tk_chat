06-04-2018T00:02:44,MatyMaty,that's above everything else :persevere:
06-04-2018T00:02:47,WIPKING,Why is zen x kat not good
06-04-2018T00:02:53,Bgrmystr2,"""pair the spares"" would be a literal creation of a ship, @MrEase"
06-04-2018T00:02:54,Ordithus,Nice robit
06-04-2018T00:02:58,Combak,WB WIP!
06-04-2018T00:03:03,WIPKING,Hi
06-04-2018T00:03:05,Bigboi182,Various Reasons WIP.
06-04-2018T00:03:10,WIPKING,Ok
06-04-2018T00:03:13,Bigboi182,VARIOUS reasons...
06-04-2018T00:03:15,Dadrobit,I'm honestly proud of that one.
06-04-2018T00:03:20,MrEase,because its just shoving her off on Zen because she couldn't get with Nat
06-04-2018T00:03:27,FenceEqualizer,Because they haven't meet. Can't go sailing without foundation!
06-04-2018T00:03:30,Unenlagia,I'd be okay with that if it actually developed and not just thrown in
06-04-2018T00:03:30,Bigboi182,Or Eric
06-04-2018T00:03:33,MrEase,thats the only reason the ship exists
06-04-2018T00:03:42,FenceEqualizer,The ship will sink
06-04-2018T00:03:59,Bigboi182,"What do you think about Eric and Kat, Maty?"
06-04-2018T00:04:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,must happen
06-04-2018T00:04:08,MrEase,I mean ships have existed for less though
06-04-2018T00:04:09,unsteddyphoenix,Even worse
06-04-2018T00:04:10,WIPKING,No
06-04-2018T00:04:14,Unenlagia,I think Mike is a little agoraphobic
06-04-2018T00:04:16,WIPKING,Yep bad
06-04-2018T00:04:17,MatyMaty,I think is kinda clear
06-04-2018T00:04:23,WIPKING,Rocks plus water
06-04-2018T00:04:24,MrEase,Kat deserves better
06-04-2018T00:04:27,MatyMaty,Eric doesn't really like Kat that way :P
06-04-2018T00:04:31,WIPKING,Much better
06-04-2018T00:04:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kat and Evals?
06-04-2018T00:04:39,WIPKING,Noooo
06-04-2018T00:04:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,nah
06-04-2018T00:04:46,unsteddyphoenix,He belongs with Mike they are in love
06-04-2018T00:04:47,Ordithus,What about Kat and Nibbly?
06-04-2018T00:04:51,WIPKING,Mike maybe
06-04-2018T00:04:58,MatyMaty,although I could see
06-04-2018T00:04:59,FenceEqualizer,But they family
06-04-2018T00:05:02,unsteddyphoenix,Im concerned about the logistics...
06-04-2018T00:05:10,WIPKING,Slave family
06-04-2018T00:05:16,MatyMaty,Kat x guard captain guy whose name I forgot
06-04-2018T00:05:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kei

06-04-2018T00:05:25,unsteddyphoenix,Uh.
06-04-2018T00:05:27,MrEase,absolutely not
06-04-2018T00:05:30,MatyMaty,they are both sorta rejected by the ones they like :P
06-04-2018T00:05:34,MrEase,He belongs to Reni
06-04-2018T00:05:34,Bgrmystr2,:ship::boom::cruise_ship: The ship war is real :ptv-shock:
06-04-2018T00:05:39,Combak,"Yeah, Reni is winning that ship/"
06-04-2018T00:05:40,Unenlagia,Rejectshipping
06-04-2018T00:05:42,unsteddyphoenix,Thats just...thats the same problem with Zen and Kat
06-04-2018T00:05:47,Bigboi182,XD Bgr.
06-04-2018T00:05:52,SageSaga,so they can settle for eachother and be like a real family
06-04-2018T00:05:53,FenceEqualizer,Kei you heathen and he already has a cruise
06-04-2018T00:05:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm on Maty's side on this war
06-04-2018T00:06:04,MatyMaty,XD
06-04-2018T00:06:07,Vatruvius,I would voice my opinion but my keys on my keyboard don't work for me to type the names. I am on the unpopular said it seems.
06-04-2018T00:06:15,Bigboi182,I hope noone comes up with weird ships.
06-04-2018T00:06:17,unsteddyphoenix,But...it's literally the same logic as pairing Zen and Kat...
06-04-2018T00:06:33,Bigboi182,Like Reni x Nora *shudders*
06-04-2018T00:06:37,Unenlagia,I wasn't down for that ship until I saw that sketch where Zen and Kat are casually intruduced. That felt more natural to me.
06-04-2018T00:06:40,MrEase,Really we can all agree that Maren X Raine or Zen X Raine needs to happen... So that rival boys Sythe and Red can hook up
06-04-2018T00:06:43,FenceEqualizer,Dragons don't follow logic look at Nota
06-04-2018T00:06:47,Bgrmystr2,lol big you literally just created that ship
06-04-2018T00:06:49,Bgrmystr2,just now
06-04-2018T00:06:56,Bigboi182,Damn.
06-04-2018T00:06:56,Bgrmystr2,by saying it
06-04-2018T00:06:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yes Ease
06-04-2018T00:06:58,Bgrmystr2,congrats
06-04-2018T00:07:00,Combak,"lol, Nota."
06-04-2018T00:07:00,Unenlagia,Isn't that incest?
06-04-2018T00:07:01,FenceEqualizer,Nora*
06-04-2018T00:07:03,unsteddyphoenix,Defintely Eric X Raine is the best answer
06-04-2018T00:07:03,MatyMaty,Maren x Raine is kinda
06-04-2018T00:07:05,MatyMaty,eeeh
06-04-2018T00:07:07,Ordithus,"You really push for that ship, MrEase :ptv-laugh:"
06-04-2018T00:07:13,MatyMaty,Not a big fan :P
06-04-2018T00:07:14,MrEase,You have no idea
06-04-2018T00:07:14,WIPKING,Kat x the wolf they caught
06-04-2018T00:07:21,Zero08,doesnt know all these characters too well
06-04-2018T00:07:22,Bigboi182,Zen?
06-04-2018T00:07:28,WIPKING,Yes
06-04-2018T00:07:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Zen x Raine all the way, but maren is good substitute"
06-04-2018T00:07:32,Unenlagia,His name is Wolf Terrorist.
06-04-2018T00:07:33,Bigboi182,That isn't happening.
06-04-2018T00:07:34,Combak,"No, terrorist Wolf."
06-04-2018T00:07:39,SageSaga,"""Daddy, how did you and mom meet?"" ""Well she was like 'im only going to live for like 10 years more max' and i was like 'i dont like long term commitments' so yep- that's about it"""

06-04-2018T00:07:51,Combak,Wow Sage...
06-04-2018T00:07:51,FenceEqualizer,But...Red X Raine...
06-04-2018T00:07:52,unsteddyphoenix,Kat X Random Tribal Basitin #3
06-04-2018T00:07:54,HeresyArtStream,I like Maren and Sythe
06-04-2018T00:07:57,MatyMaty,XD
06-04-2018T00:08:02,MrEase,Red X Raine is cute
06-04-2018T00:08:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Red x Sythe Fence
06-04-2018T00:08:07,Dadrobit,Wet Fox is dazed. Three basitin glare with drive. Need vital fluids.
06-04-2018T00:08:09,WIPKING,What about lesbain?!
06-04-2018T00:08:14,MatyMaty,I like Maren and Sythe too
06-04-2018T00:08:19,MrEase,"But the racist boys need to fall in love, and learn to not be racist"
06-04-2018T00:08:21,Bgrmystr2,Honestly.. I just like watching the ship war
06-04-2018T00:08:28,FenceEqualizer,That ship is a ship of hate
06-04-2018T00:08:29,unsteddyphoenix,I like how he doesnt like long term commitments but had a kid
06-04-2018T00:08:29,Ordithus,"Sythe isn't really racist, though"
06-04-2018T00:08:34,unsteddyphoenix,He fucked up
06-04-2018T00:08:36,MrEase,I mean Sythe's kinda neutral
06-04-2018T00:08:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Red x Brahn
06-04-2018T00:08:42,Ordithus,"He's like, the least racist character in the comic"
06-04-2018T00:08:44,MrEase,but he loves teasing the shit out of Red
06-04-2018T00:08:46,SageSaga,I like Karen... with no one
06-04-2018T00:08:49,Unenlagia,I sail aboard the SS Keith/Natani
06-04-2018T00:08:50,Ordithus,That's very true
06-04-2018T00:08:51,HeresyArtStream,Sythe is a humanaboo.
06-04-2018T00:08:54,WIPKING,Kat x karen
06-04-2018T00:08:57,Bgrmystr2,Sage that's too sad xD
06-04-2018T00:09:01,MrEase,so he aggravates it
06-04-2018T00:09:04,MatyMaty,Karen x Nibbly
06-04-2018T00:09:06,Sammit,there will be a naval war with all those conflicting ships
06-04-2018T00:09:07,HeresyArtStream,Only makes sense that Sythe gets a hot human girl.
06-04-2018T00:09:09,Ordithus,That's so Sage can have Karen to himself
06-04-2018T00:09:13,Vatruvius,This ship war is tearing my personal ships to shreds. I am like a dingy rowing through massive 200 cannon ships shooting at eachother.
06-04-2018T00:09:27,Bigboi182,Xd Vat.

06-04-2018T00:38:46,Tokagedraws,who's the fox dude again?
06-04-2018T00:38:53,Unenlagia,Carver
06-04-2018T00:38:53,Combak,Carver
06-04-2018T00:38:54,Dadrobit,Best boi Carver
06-04-2018T00:38:54,unsteddyphoenix,Steve
06-04-2018T00:38:57,InTheLionsDen,Bob
06-04-2018T00:38:58,Unenlagia,STEEB
06-04-2018T00:39:02,WIPKING,Wait hes doing another page?
06-04-2018T00:39:04,Tokagedraws,oh
06-04-2018T00:39:11,Tokagedraws,is this where he was randomly teleported?
06-04-2018T00:39:12,Combak,... Another page for the chapter.
06-04-2018T00:39:15,Combak,Yep
06-04-2018T00:39:22,Unenlagia,Carver is Clovis's boi
06-04-2018T00:39:23,WIPKING,Tonight
06-04-2018T00:39:31,Combak,"Oh, heck no. XD"
06-04-2018T00:39:32,Dadrobit,"Nah, first he ended up in a bathtub. This is the second teleport."
06-04-2018T00:39:46,ZRO4825,lol
06-04-2018T00:39:50,Ordithus,"For a ""random"" teleportation, he's lucky he wound up on land."
06-04-2018T00:39:56,MagicEnchilladas,so carver can only teleport near water?
06-04-2018T00:39:57,Combak,It's almost 1:40 AM already. XD
06-04-2018T00:39:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Colvis had enough of him
06-04-2018T00:40:07,Ordithus,"And not in, say, the middle of the ocean, or space."
06-04-2018T00:40:14,Ordithus,Or the center of a star.
06-04-2018T00:40:21,InTheLionsDen,His first panel here has him in the water.
06-04-2018T00:40:24,Combak,He may have gotten washed up there.
06-04-2018T00:40:28,BadFoMo,"From left to right; their names are: Slightly-Darker-Maddie, Blond-Maddie, and Black-Maddie."
06-04-2018T00:40:29,MagicEnchilladas,"i dont think he would get to space, due to the lack of ley lines"
06-04-2018T00:40:37,Tokagedraws,I'm glad even after we left the island
06-04-2018T00:40:39,unsteddyphoenix,*keith
06-04-2018T00:40:46,Unenlagia,he might have been headed south to begin with and got shunted that far out
06-04-2018T00:40:49,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, The one on the left was very Maddie like before color."
06-04-2018T00:40:51,Tokagedraws,"Tom still is like ""no we're not done yet, here's the vvomens"""
06-04-2018T00:40:52,Bigboi182,@BadFoMo Close enough.
06-04-2018T00:40:58,LokiSpaiSS,"my God, I first time in my life on the stream ...."
06-04-2018T00:41:02,Vexd,So Western Basitins better confirmed?
06-04-2018T00:41:04,MrEase,"its also not the same island Tokage, this is the western one"
06-04-2018T00:41:08,WIPKING,Ok
06-04-2018T00:41:15,HeresyArtStream,Hi Vexd
06-04-2018T00:41:16,Bigboi182,yes Vexd.
06-04-2018T00:41:19,Ordithus,*Eastern
06-04-2018T00:41:19,Vexd,Ey
06-04-2018T00:41:20,MrEase,yes
06-04-2018T00:41:24,Unenlagia,"@Vexd Recanonized, actually."
06-04-2018T00:41:37,ZRO4825,Western Basitins on the East side of the Island. iirc :V
06-04-2018T00:41:41,Combak,Hi Vexd!
06-04-2018T00:41:43,Tokagedraws,well its not like the party will go to the west island instead of the other one
06-04-2018T00:41:45,HeresyArtStream,"Carver is about to get entangled in some Western Basitin black magic ritual, from the looks of it."
06-04-2018T00:41:46,Ordithus,It's only slightly confusing
06-04-2018T00:41:57,Unenlagia,And we've headcanoned that Keith's mom was a spear wielding amazonian badass spy
06-04-2018T00:42:06,WIPKING,Really do like the black one
06-04-2018T00:42:18,Dadrobit,"Black, Tan, and Light Orange magic by the looks of it."
06-04-2018T00:42:27,ZRO4825,I've headcanoned that Carver is actually Laura with a Basitin Black Magic genderswap and a mind wipe &gt;:V
06-04-2018T00:42:35,ZRO4825,And then a timewarp~
06-04-2018T00:42:45,Vexd,:ptv-kippi2:

06-04-2018T00:42:58,MagicEnchilladas,lets do the time warp again
06-04-2018T00:43:12,WIPKING,?
06-04-2018T00:43:15,Combak,Take it back now y'all.
06-04-2018T00:43:15,MrEase,"I still wish Carver wasn't actually shown, I wanted people to keep making up places for him to be teleported"
06-04-2018T00:43:15,BadFoMo,Francis: I hate Musicals.
06-04-2018T00:43:43,Combak,Francis?
06-04-2018T00:43:48,Ordithus,My headcanon was that Raine actually did vaporise him
06-04-2018T00:43:51,MagicEnchilladas,ITS AJAX
06-04-2018T00:43:57,unsteddyphoenix,the bathtub is canon in my heart

06-04-2018T00:46:53,BadFoMo,"I'd be like Butthead in that one part of the movie and be like ""Wow! ...This is the coolest thing I have ever seen."""
06-04-2018T00:46:54,unsteddyphoenix,Sorcs are best
06-04-2018T00:46:56,Ordithus,@Vexd Western Basitins are friendly it seems
06-04-2018T00:47:04,Unenlagia,THANK YOU
06-04-2018T00:47:25,unsteddyphoenix,Sad Xanathars didnt really give them anything interesting but
06-04-2018T00:47:49,SageSaga,Tom's experience as a Sorcerer with his parents being accomplished wizards was fun
06-04-2018T00:48:09,Unenlagia,Hahaha
06-04-2018T00:48:13,unsteddyphoenix,Roleplay dissapointing your parents sounds great
06-04-2018T00:48:19,Bigboi182,i would have expected nothing else.
06-04-2018T00:48:19,SageSaga,"""It's not a phase mom! Im a sorcerer!"""
06-04-2018T00:48:24,Unenlagia,That's amazing

06-04-2018T00:49:47,SageSaga,Oh yeah Tom - no DnD tomorrow- start thinking about a new DnD character though...
06-04-2018T00:49:55,Vexd,"Speaking of Sorcerers, can't make up my mind which ranged class to run next on Dark Souls"
06-04-2018T00:49:58,WIPKING,DnD?
06-04-2018T00:50:01,SageSaga,i dont think the current game is going to run much longer
06-04-2018T00:50:09,unsteddyphoenix,Are you about to win!? :O
06-04-2018T00:50:10,Vatruvius,"You poor think WIP, not knowing D&D"
06-04-2018T00:50:20,WIPKING,Tell me plz
06-04-2018T00:50:22,unsteddyphoenix,Win the roleplays?
06-04-2018T00:50:22,Bigboi182,DnD is soon to die...
06-04-2018T00:50:27,Vatruvius,That means they are about to die unsteddy. :D
06-04-2018T00:50:28,Unenlagia,Have you done a Pyromancer yet?
06-04-2018T00:50:30,ZRO4825,Dungeons & Dragons
06-04-2018T00:50:32,Bigboi182,It's been pretty long...
06-04-2018T00:50:32,Unenlagia,Those are fun
06-04-2018T00:50:33,Vexd,Not yet
06-04-2018T00:50:36,WIPKING,Oh
06-04-2018T00:50:39,MagicEnchilladas,im a pathfinder guy
06-04-2018T00:50:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Naw, Sage would never~"
06-04-2018T00:50:41,Dadrobit,Player deaths inbound
06-04-2018T00:50:46,SageSaga,the current game isnt even really DnD - it's Super Heroes IN SPACE!
06-04-2018T00:50:46,Unenlagia,I play Pathfinder
06-04-2018T00:50:46,Vatruvius,It won't ever die Bigboi
06-04-2018T00:50:48,Bigboi182,I haven't played it yet though.
06-04-2018T00:50:54,Unenlagia,I'm not keen on 2nd Edition
06-04-2018T00:50:58,unsteddyphoenix,Innn spaaaace~
06-04-2018T00:51:07,Ordithus,Has Bob become All?
06-04-2018T00:51:09,Bigboi182,Spaaaaaaaaaace!
06-04-2018T00:51:13,MagicEnchilladas,havent checked out second edition yet
06-04-2018T00:51:25,MagicEnchilladas,unless starfinder counts
06-04-2018T00:51:26,unsteddyphoenix,Dnd is a blanket term tbh
06-04-2018T00:51:42,SageSaga,not really
06-04-2018T00:51:43,BadFoMo,Space Core: I'm in Space :).
06-04-2018T00:51:45,Unenlagia,"Starfinder has a lot of the 2nd edition streamlining, but not as much"
06-04-2018T00:51:54,SageSaga,RPG would be the blanket term
06-04-2018T00:52:00,MagicEnchilladas,alrighty then
06-04-2018T00:52:03,Unenlagia,And actions are broken down differently
06-04-2018T00:52:05,unsteddyphoenix,"It should be, but here we are"
06-04-2018T00:52:18,Unenlagia,What really upsets me is that Pathfinder society is forcing a shift to 2nd edition
06-04-2018T00:52:21,unsteddyphoenix,RPG normally refers to video games anyway
06-04-2018T00:52:33,Ordithus,Or a weapon of war
06-04-2018T00:52:35,Unenlagia,Which means I leave my best characters in the dust for some new system I don't like.
06-04-2018T00:52:36,Vatruvius,I don't think so unsteddy.
06-04-2018T00:52:42,MagicEnchilladas,and wizards of the coast had a rather good marketing department
06-04-2018T00:52:49,unsteddyphoenix,I do think so and im right so. :T
06-04-2018T00:52:50,Vatruvius,RPG is just a role playing game...does not imply video games.
06-04-2018T00:52:59,Unenlagia,Tabletop RPG then
06-04-2018T00:53:13,Vatruvius,There you go.
06-04-2018T00:53:19,unsteddyphoenix,Too long~
06-04-2018T00:53:26,Vatruvius,TRPG?
06-04-2018T00:53:26,unsteddyphoenix,DndDLC?
06-04-2018T00:53:39,SageSaga,RealRPGs

06-04-2018T00:54:49,unsteddyphoenix,Where do you get the time
06-04-2018T00:54:51,SageSaga,Mutants and Masterminds is ok
06-04-2018T00:54:56,unsteddyphoenix,And the dedicated DMs
06-04-2018T00:55:01,SageSaga,i hate the Fate System
06-04-2018T00:55:01,Ordithus,Ooh Fate is fun

06-04-2018T00:55:09,Unenlagia,"Yeah, we're doing it more for the superheroing"
06-04-2018T00:55:37,Unenlagia,We tried a superhero FATE game but it got bogged down and the GM lost all his data on a HD failure
06-04-2018T00:55:38,SageSaga,i use Savage Worlds for Super Heros

06-04-2018T01:22:30,BadFoMo,Moar please!
06-04-2018T01:22:38,unsteddyphoenix,When did East and West Basitins split off again?
06-04-2018T01:22:47,CrimsonHelsing,Twas fun Tom! Looking forward to reading this one!
06-04-2018T01:22:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night Tom, thanks for the stram"
06-04-2018T01:22:57,BrunoYcaro,g'night tom
06-04-2018T01:22:58,Dadrobit,"IIRC, the explanation was ""They don't like to talk about it..."""
06-04-2018T01:22:59,Twokinds,"A long, long time ago"
06-04-2018T01:23:07,Twokinds,On an island far far away.
06-04-2018T01:23:09,Unenlagia,In time immemorial
06-04-2018T01:23:14,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
06-04-2018T01:23:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
06-04-2018T01:23:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Ok, I can see how that would happen."
06-04-2018T01:23:24,Vatruvius,How to check if a suggestion is a spoiler if not obvious and you do not want to waste a sketch suggestion to find out?
06-04-2018T01:23:26,Twokinds,Western Basitins are more spread out than their Eastern cousins.
06-04-2018T01:23:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,now I need to listen to Weird al
06-04-2018T01:23:33,Unenlagia,*dramatic fog machine* Thousands of years ago...
06-04-2018T01:23:48,unsteddyphoenix,Is the black basitin a rare case? Or is that common too
06-04-2018T01:23:49,Dadrobit,"Wait, Natural Western, or Labeled Western?"
06-04-2018T01:23:51,Twokinds,There are a lot on various small islands that don't really associate at all with the main island.
06-04-2018T01:24:14,Unenlagia,So tribes of Basitins that we haven't even seen yet?
06-04-2018T01:24:21,unsteddyphoenix,I see~
06-04-2018T01:24:22,MagicEnchilladas,"""they split because someone said they wouldnt"""
06-04-2018T01:24:41,Twokinds,"Yeah, small enclaves of islanders."
06-04-2018T01:24:49,Twokinds,They're the 'Wild' Basitins
06-04-2018T01:24:57,Ordithus,Interesting
06-04-2018T01:25:07,BadFoMo,Wild West Basitins?
06-04-2018T01:26:07,Unenlagia,Funny you mention that...
06-04-2018T01:26:14,Ordithus,Lots more to Mekkan than we've seen.
06-04-2018T01:26:27,unsteddyphoenix,Wild = savage in this case?
06-04-2018T01:26:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wild = lewd ankles
06-04-2018T01:26:49,unsteddyphoenix,I guess it depends on who you ask yeah
06-04-2018T01:26:51,Twokinds,The mainlanders consider them weirdos because they're generally pacifistic and don't care about purpetual war.
06-04-2018T01:26:56,Twokinds,How uncivilized.
06-04-2018T01:26:57,BluePhantom90,So that wasn't the Main Western Basitin's?
06-04-2018T01:27:02,Dadrobit,"In the sense that they are referred to as savages my the islanders,  probablyt"
06-04-2018T01:27:10,Dadrobit,"Ah, there."
06-04-2018T01:27:21,Unenlagia,Ah
06-04-2018T01:27:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"oh boy, if carver does not say Hello there, I would be bummed out"

06-04-2018T01:28:39,BluePhantom90,so kinda a dead man huh
06-04-2018T01:28:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Hard to imagine ""stick em with the pointy end"" would stand up to organised eastern military"

06-04-2018T01:29:33,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not sure the military would actually consider them worth going after either, though"
06-04-2018T01:29:33,Twokinds,"Yeah, not really. But at the same time Eastern Basitins don't really care about wiping out tiny islands of random people."
06-04-2018T01:29:45,Dadrobit,They become very disorganized after seeing the warpaints
06-04-2018T01:29:45,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, see. Thought as much"
06-04-2018T01:29:55,Dadrobit,o/ Bruno
06-04-2018T01:29:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, too lewd to deal with."
06-04-2018T01:30:06,Unenlagia,I'm guessing that the Easterners are so tightly regimented that it's easy to outmaneuver them
06-04-2018T01:30:22,Unenlagia,Which has happened historically
06-04-2018T01:30:22,MagicEnchilladas,nobody expects a sucker punch
06-04-2018T01:30:34,Twokinds,They dip their legs in paint
06-04-2018T01:30:40,Twokinds,That makes it okay.
06-04-2018T01:30:45,unsteddyphoenix,Oh phew.

06-04-2018T01:31:09,Twokinds,(the easterners do not agree)
06-04-2018T01:31:13,FenceEqualizer,I feel like someone would point out that doesn't hide much.
06-04-2018T01:31:24,unsteddyphoenix,"Do they have no compulsion to follow orders at all, or is it just less?"
06-04-2018T01:31:24,BadFoMo,...I don't know how to react to that.
06-04-2018T01:31:54,MrEase,they have an obsessive compulsion to break orders
06-04-2018T01:32:06,MrEase,the only way to order them is through reverse psychology
06-04-2018T01:32:18,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
06-04-2018T01:32:20,MagicEnchilladas,and that only works sometimes

06-04-2018T02:34:17,Dadrobit,"Mind you, that bitching was him asking for welding helmets since August to actually teach his welding class."

06-04-2018T17:03:34,Twokinds,"I like most things, though."
06-04-2018T17:03:39,Tylertt,same tom
06-04-2018T17:03:45,Twokinds,I haven't played any of the Devil May Cry games.
06-04-2018T17:03:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just gonna try a spring roll
06-04-2018T17:03:53,BluePhantom90,WHAT!!
06-04-2018T17:04:19,BluePhantom90,Not even the New one! r-r which a lot of fans hate but I actually like
06-04-2018T17:04:49,Tylertt,"Blue, I've only played the third game but I really enjoyed it."
06-04-2018T17:04:57,Twokinds,I'm afraid not.
06-04-2018T17:05:36,BluePhantom90,I hated two e-e they put in a glitch so when you do Easy mode its Hard mode instead. Tolling new players
06-04-2018T17:06:46,Tylertt,"but if easy mode was hard mode, then hard mode was easy mode... or was it still hard mode?"
06-04-2018T17:06:48,BluePhantom90,I couldn't get pass the first boss
06-04-2018T17:07:28,BluePhantom90,If you did normal it would be Fine and Hard I have no idea.
06-04-2018T17:07:42,Tylertt,ok
06-04-2018T17:08:45,Tylertt,how many games are there now in the devil may cry series?
06-04-2018T17:09:07,BluePhantom90,T-T I never completed it... Um hold on
06-04-2018T17:09:42,BluePhantom90,4 + reboot everyone hated
06-04-2018T17:10:14,Tylertt,"ok, I was able to complete the third game up to normal mose but hard moode was too hard for me"
06-04-2018T17:10:22,Tylertt,mode*
06-04-2018T17:11:30,Tylertt,was there these statues in the earlier games that you had to combo on with a certain weapon?
06-04-2018T17:11:33,BluePhantom90,DMC4 was my favorite because of Nero and his weapons
06-04-2018T17:12:15,BluePhantom90,"hmm they were in the games I don't remember since I only played 2, got 2/3rds of 4 and completed the Reboot"
06-04-2018T17:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, is Holly adapting to her wet foodless diet?"
06-04-2018T17:13:40,Twokinds,She's reluctantly eating.
06-04-2018T17:13:54,Twokinds,She's fat anyway. So a diet is good for her.
06-04-2018T17:14:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"“If I must, but I’m gonna complain the whole time”"
06-04-2018T17:14:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Kiwi’s on a diet, but I can’t say I’m seeing change"
06-04-2018T17:15:15,BluePhantom90,Tom you should definitely do a magic rune script or alphabet.
06-04-2018T17:17:29,BluePhantom90,Or try your hand on DND style Twokinds books for laughs.
06-04-2018T17:18:44,Twokinds,"That sounds like a lot of work, and I'm not a... language expert"
06-04-2018T17:19:57,SpazztasticKiwi,None of us English good
06-04-2018T17:20:31,Twokinds,Now I'm hungry for General Tso's Chicken
06-04-2018T17:21:14,BluePhantom90,Oh I done something like creating my own l alphabet. BUT yeah how you speak it I understand. Hmm someone might be able to help with the books and do a Go Fundme account.
06-04-2018T17:22:46,BluePhantom90,I bet it would be funded in like 4 days maybe less. r-r Angryjoe had his thing funded in less then 24hours
06-04-2018T17:25:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Sorry not sorry 🍜
06-04-2018T17:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Just saw a guy do a 360 head swivel at a girl in a two piece cosplay
06-04-2018T17:27:34,BluePhantom90,Yeah after thinking about it I could see why it might take a while to make a DND books of Twokinds
06-04-2018T17:27:37,Twokinds,It probably wouldn't be worth it since Western Basitins aren't really a big part of the story
06-04-2018T17:28:09,Twokinds,Maybe if I did side work involving Western Islanders. Then it might be funny  to hide hidden messages on their bodies.
06-04-2018T17:29:43,BluePhantom90,heh Well the one Western Basitin with what looks like hand print on her boob could mean taken lol
06-04-2018T17:31:39,BluePhantom90,I mean who would dare grab a female Basitin boob without their hand broken in 20 places
06-04-2018T17:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Classy
06-04-2018T17:37:10,BluePhantom90,I mean anime rules that is what would happen with crazy strong women
06-04-2018T17:41:20,Twokinds,I want to draw a Male Western Islander. Never drawn one before.
06-04-2018T17:42:13,BluePhantom90,Well you might get your chance with a Fan wanting to see one.
06-04-2018T17:42:28,BluePhantom90,But you did long long ago lol
06-04-2018T17:42:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Is that island like with superwoman - 99% warrior women?
06-04-2018T17:44:31,BluePhantom90,I mean someone remembered these old sketches of yours https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/359539122496339968/432161832208433153/NewBasitinConsept1.jpg
06-04-2018T17:44:40,BluePhantom90,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/359539122496339968/432161781625126912/NewBasitinConsept2.jpg
06-04-2018T17:46:23,Twokinds,"yeah those are the original concept art for Western Basitins, back at the start of the comic."
06-04-2018T17:47:07,Twokinds,Amazing they never showed up in the comic until 14 years later XD
06-04-2018T17:47:23,BluePhantom90,yeah Neon posted them. I think someone will ask for male western Basitin's
06-04-2018T17:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,How do you tattoo fur
06-04-2018T17:50:17,BluePhantom90,Its Paint
06-04-2018T17:51:40,NeonMitsumi,I heard my name.
06-04-2018T17:51:59,BluePhantom90,uh-huh
06-04-2018T17:53:02,NeonMitsumi,"Of course I posted them, I designed Neon with heavy inspiration from those sketches."
06-04-2018T17:53:34,BluePhantom90,I see
06-04-2018T17:53:50,NeonMitsumi,Took them long enough to show up. *cough*
06-04-2018T17:53:58,BluePhantom90,lol
06-04-2018T17:59:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Why does comi con have to be July 19-22?
06-04-2018T18:01:59,Twokinds,"Nah Westerners are like anywhere else, close to 50-50 male-female."
06-04-2018T18:03:20,Twokinds,It's not Themyscira XD
06-04-2018T18:04:21,BluePhantom90,Well what do the Males do the stay at home stuff while the Females do the hunting and gathering?
06-04-2018T18:12:00,Twokinds,If they want to?
06-04-2018T18:12:47,NeonMitsumi,That sentence.
06-04-2018T18:13:03,BluePhantom90,Sorry terrible gramma
06-04-2018T18:13:09,BluePhantom90,*Grammar
06-04-2018T18:13:27,NeonMitsumi,Lmao
06-04-2018T18:14:49,BluePhantom90,"HUH SO do the Females do the male roles (Hunting, and building) While males do more female role stuff ( Like caring for the kids and cooking)."
06-04-2018T18:15:16,BluePhantom90,Since well Females are bigger and Stronger then Males
06-04-2018T18:17:05,Twokinds,"I don't have a detailed map on Western Basitin culture, but no, they probably don't seperate roles between the genders like that."
06-04-2018T18:18:05,Twokinds,"It's not a female-dominant society, like the tigers."
06-04-2018T18:18:24,BluePhantom90,Oh interesting
06-04-2018T18:18:49,Twokinds,"It's pretty much a free, hippy-dippy anyone takes whatever roles they can fulfill kind of deal. A lot less rigid than Easterners."
06-04-2018T18:20:03,Twokinds,They don't have the huge physical segrigation of gender like Keith's people.
06-04-2018T18:20:27,Twokinds,"But you know, like any society, it's impossible to completely generalize."
06-04-2018T18:20:30,BluePhantom90,Damn lol wish you did put that into the comic
06-04-2018T18:22:02,Twokinds,Westerners are a lot less centralized than easterners. The eastern Basitins were pretty much one massive colony.
06-04-2018T18:22:41,Twokinds,Westerners exist both on the mainland and on lots of tiny islands. So there's lots of micro-societies with different rules.
06-04-2018T18:22:55,BluePhantom90,but wonder how Keith's mother adapted to the ideals. I mean its completely different from her culture
06-04-2018T18:24:07,Twokinds,Well it didn't end very well.
06-04-2018T18:26:26,BluePhantom90,"Well besides that last part. I mean if no one would have found out her papers were fake, would she have adapted"
06-04-2018T18:27:39,BluePhantom90,"well that is kinda beating the ""What if"" to the creator that already have a pre-set history."
06-04-2018T18:28:32,Twokinds,"Well obviously she did, at least to an extent."
06-04-2018T18:30:21,BluePhantom90,"Still would have been weird. Being in a Culture that allows both sexes to be together, where a society keeps them separate."
06-04-2018T18:34:23,BluePhantom90,r-r wonder how Keith or his Father would have lasted as a Western Basitin
06-04-2018T18:41:29,NeonMitsumi,"Hey, Tom? Would you mind enabling whispers on like 30 seconds? I could use some quick help."
06-04-2018T18:44:52,BluePhantom90,I wont whisper. -shrugs
06-04-2018T18:46:45,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!
06-04-2018T18:46:53,BluePhantom90,hey
06-04-2018T18:48:13,Dadrobit,"Chilling w/ dad, BBQ'ing some chicken, he's super stressed, depressed about maybe quitting his job, hoping some good food'll cheer him up."
06-04-2018T18:48:42,BluePhantom90,hmm yeah v-v I miss the grill food
06-04-2018T18:49:13,Dadrobit,"Was hoping to try and spatchcock it with him since he'd never done it before, but he kinda balked at my description for preperation."
06-04-2018T18:49:41,BluePhantom90,lol
06-04-2018T18:50:07,Dadrobit,"""Cut out the spine and crush the ribs to make the bird completely flat. Once you get over the mental gymnastics of it being like staving in a two year old's chest, it tastes delicious!"""
06-04-2018T18:50:29,Dadrobit,"""Dadrobit, you are fucked up in the head, I love you, but you are fucked in the head."""
06-04-2018T18:50:53,BluePhantom90,lol
06-04-2018T18:50:54,Dadrobit,So a BBQ Roast it is.
06-04-2018T18:52:10,Dadrobit,"Gonna have some nephews over as well in a bit, gonna have to help entertain them, so my presence here is tenuous at best."
06-04-2018T18:52:29,BluePhantom90,yeah.
06-04-2018T18:57:02,BluePhantom90,Well Anyways Tom I take you are relaxing until Tomorrow for the Sketch stream?
06-04-2018T19:02:23,NeonMitsumi,watches the tumbleweed roll by.
06-04-2018T19:02:49,BluePhantom90,Take Tom didn't allow you to whisper to him?
06-04-2018T19:03:34,NeonMitsumi,My guess is that he's AFK.
06-04-2018T19:03:47,BluePhantom90,maybe
06-04-2018T19:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m going on to bed early since we fly home tomorrow
06-04-2018T19:11:43,BluePhantom90,cya

06-04-2018T20:46:52,Bgrmystr2,"and fluff, I think"
06-04-2018T20:47:02,Bgrmystr2,not sure if they have different groups or whatnot
