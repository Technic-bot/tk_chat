18-08-2018T02:14:53,Bgrmystr2,there'd be nothing random about a stream tomorrow
18-08-2018T02:15:33,Bgrmystr2,or.. today according to tom's clock at least.
18-08-2018T02:37:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m talking any random stream. On any other channel I follow
18-08-2018T02:39:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Like an interference stream
18-08-2018T02:39:59,Bgrmystr2,ooooh

18-08-2018T14:46:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Hi Ord, and Terra"
18-08-2018T14:48:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,I hope AU Sythe and Flora's family gets picked.  You know I probably should one day do a crossover where Nora is defeated by the one person who can beat her: Scrooge McDuck!
18-08-2018T14:48:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,He's after her treasure!
18-08-2018T14:49:59,MallardDuckAvia,I hope Sealeen gets picked today.
18-08-2018T14:50:03,MallardDuckAvia,Hi everyone
18-08-2018T14:50:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"♪Life is like a hurricane, here in duckburg♪"

18-08-2018T14:51:29,BadFoMo,"Well, I once again requested Suddenly Tails 2."
18-08-2018T14:51:31,MallardDuckAvia,Why is life a hurricane?
18-08-2018T14:51:52,MallardDuckAvia,Suddenly ears?
18-08-2018T14:51:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,They had the guy who plays War Machine do Donald Duck's normal sounding voice on the season finale of Ducktales reboot. Marv was singing the theme song for Ducktales.
18-08-2018T14:52:00,CrimsonQuill,I've once again thrown in Spartan Raine.
18-08-2018T14:52:10,CrimsonQuill,I really want to see a Halo crossover voted in...
18-08-2018T14:52:20,CrimsonQuill,None of my suggestions have made it yet.
18-08-2018T14:52:23,Mippy,Hi everyone *yawn*
18-08-2018T14:52:28,BadFoMo,Yo.
18-08-2018T14:52:28,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
18-08-2018T14:52:31,MallardDuckAvia,I want to see a Jurassic Park sketch
18-08-2018T14:52:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My man

18-08-2018T14:52:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Fox
18-08-2018T14:53:26,CrimsonQuill,Baryonyx
18-08-2018T14:53:33,CrimsonQuill,Or Tarbosaurus
18-08-2018T14:53:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,I keep voting for the Halo requests as well as the Mass Effect request.  I think the Mass Effect request needs to be worded better.  that might help it win.
18-08-2018T14:53:44,TerraTheWizard,has picarto updated the ui again?
18-08-2018T14:53:47,TerraTheWizard,can't really tell

18-08-2018T14:54:16,Twokinds,Along with other symbols
18-08-2018T14:54:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,It might Quill.
18-08-2018T14:54:30,Twokinds,I think it's better this way
18-08-2018T14:54:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,Although I like the idea of an Arbiter Natani.  ;)
18-08-2018T14:54:45,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I'm ok either way

18-08-2018T14:56:07,MallardDuckAvia,Baryonyx is my #4 after Eustreptospondylus and Carcharodontosaurus
18-08-2018T14:56:08,BadFoMo,"@CrimsonQuill Sorry, I have to do it. Grunt: Ah, poor little Raine. Stolen at the age of 6 and drafted into a military experament!"
18-08-2018T14:56:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think Tom could manage it.  :)

18-08-2018T16:02:58,phil199,"my old laptop wasn´t that lucky, got completly fired by lightning"
18-08-2018T16:03:08,TorqueEmUp,Especially in Florida of all place
18-08-2018T16:03:10,SageSaga,also somehow that jumped from the network to my hdmi cable and the display port adapter died
18-08-2018T16:03:14,SageSaga,the monitor is fine
18-08-2018T16:03:25,ThingsAreMoving,rip display port
18-08-2018T16:03:29,Ordithus,Just the adapter?  Not bad
18-08-2018T16:03:35,SageSaga,just the adapter
18-08-2018T16:03:39,phil199,sometimes the lowest resistance isn´t what you expect
18-08-2018T16:03:43,SageSaga,so i was pretty lucky
18-08-2018T16:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Reni lookin sharp in her lil date shirt
18-08-2018T16:03:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Or dress

18-08-2018T16:04:03,Mippy,Hi Sage...I was  awaay and did not see you come in
18-08-2018T16:04:05,ThingsAreMoving,shirt or dress? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:

18-08-2018T16:04:29,SageSaga,well as lucky as you can get for almost being hit by lightning i guess
18-08-2018T16:04:39,SpotTheLeopard,"Some people need lightning rods. My neighbor's chimney got struck; a week after they fixed it, it was hit again"
18-08-2018T16:04:50,Katfeathers,Lack of lightning rods is probably a complacency thing
18-08-2018T16:05:00,phil199,more  Mark cuz time is better @Dino

18-08-2018T16:05:20,Xexanoth,lighting strikes twice alot
18-08-2018T16:05:22,phil199,problem is when lightning rods don´t work
18-08-2018T16:05:22,Bgrmystr2,"dozens, hundreds of times"
18-08-2018T16:05:23,SageSaga,lightning strikes many times more than twice

18-08-2018T16:25:01,Nekonny,No idea it would have lead to this
18-08-2018T16:25:03,ThingsAreMoving,":ctwokinds-keifacepalm: ""I don't earn enough to pay for this date."""
18-08-2018T16:25:17,SageSaga,because my fathers network card on the Mobo blew from lightning strike- same that almost killed my monitor
18-08-2018T16:25:23,phil199,building PC´s is ncie

18-08-2018T16:25:52,LannAF,Woohoo! that's awesome.
18-08-2018T16:25:58,LannAF,Still sucks
18-08-2018T16:25:59,LannAF,But less sucky.
18-08-2018T16:26:01,SageSaga,dead adapter now but better than dead 1070

18-08-2018T16:26:26,LannAF,Not a lot but enough to cover your stuff
18-08-2018T16:26:28,Tharkis,evenin' @Nekonny  o/
18-08-2018T16:26:34,SageSaga,my service fee is my dad gets my 1070

18-08-2018T16:27:19,LannAF,"Despite the fact I can't drink, I found it amusing how my girlfriend was in awe at the size of the wine bottle they gave her yet she still downed all of it"

18-08-2018T16:27:28,LannAF,at one of the restaurants we went to

18-08-2018T16:28:27,LannAF,I like rum.

18-08-2018T16:28:29,phil199,cya Nekonny
18-08-2018T16:28:33,MrEase,"oh, really legal drinking age in the states is that high?"
18-08-2018T16:28:36,Ordithus,See ya Ron
18-08-2018T16:28:38,TorqueEmUp,Drinking age is 21 in the U.S for those elsewhere in the world.
18-08-2018T16:28:39,MrEase,why
18-08-2018T16:28:40,ThingsAreMoving,bye ron
18-08-2018T16:28:47,BadFoMo,"Waiter: Should I bring them the bottle, or the keg?"
18-08-2018T16:28:49,Bgrmystr2,yeah and it still causes issues Ease
18-08-2018T16:28:55,Bgrmystr2,so some ppl think it's not high enough
18-08-2018T16:28:57,Bgrmystr2,._.
18-08-2018T16:28:58,LannAF,"Dunno. I drink when I go to Mexico on occasion though, only because we go to party boats."
18-08-2018T16:29:01,Ordithus,"Yes, Ease.  Though many states have a parental consent law so kids can drink under 18 if approved"
18-08-2018T16:29:02,Xexanoth,there's a common joke about how you can join the army before you can get drunk
18-08-2018T16:29:06,LannAF,I rarely drink.
18-08-2018T16:29:21,MrEase,I
18-08-2018T16:29:23,SageSaga,18 is old enough to ruin your life with marriage and ruin your life voting for a dickbag but it's not old enough to drink alcohol
18-08-2018T16:29:29,ThingsAreMoving,first time i got drunk af was at the ripe old age of 13
18-08-2018T16:29:33,LannAF,"I mean, I'm not bothered by that law tbh."
18-08-2018T16:29:34,Issus,Smoking age is 21 in some states now as well.
18-08-2018T16:29:37,LannAF,I don't care for drinking
18-08-2018T16:29:42,LannAF,It's not mandatory for anything
18-08-2018T16:29:47,phil199,"the first 2 would be a reason for drinking though, Sage"
18-08-2018T16:29:49,LannAF,"HOWEVER, being restricted from places that sell drinks"
18-08-2018T16:29:50,Issus,"Gambling, also 21."
18-08-2018T16:29:51,LannAF,Is annoying as fuck.
18-08-2018T16:29:52,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, Lann"
18-08-2018T16:29:55,LannAF,I live in Las Vegas.
18-08-2018T16:29:57,LannAF,So uh
18-08-2018T16:29:58,Bgrmystr2,Agree on both counts.
18-08-2018T16:30:01,RimaDraws,i drink a bit and i got married at 20 ruined part of my life single pringle now except with a man
18-08-2018T16:30:03,LannAF,I'd rather not get into gambling.
18-08-2018T16:30:06,LannAF,I KNOW I'm a gambler.
18-08-2018T16:30:06,Xexanoth,gambling makes more sense though
18-08-2018T16:30:06,FenceEqualizer,Rip Lann
18-08-2018T16:30:12,Xexanoth,since it can add up really quickly
18-08-2018T16:30:13,ThingsAreMoving,"huh, are there even places you're allowed to go to ?"
18-08-2018T16:30:16,RimaDraws,marriage isnt what its all cracked up to be
18-08-2018T16:30:16,LannAF,But I gamble things other than money.
18-08-2018T16:30:18,MrEase,"wonder what the legal age for buying weed is gonna be here, since its going to be controlled by the liquor board."
18-08-2018T16:30:19,Mippy,"Even if I waanted to drink, which I don't, I coulden't becaause medication"
18-08-2018T16:30:34,LannAF,Weed is also 21 and over here too.
18-08-2018T16:30:34,ThingsAreMoving,Lann gambles sould of the innocent
18-08-2018T16:30:40,ThingsAreMoving,souls*
18-08-2018T16:30:48,LannAF,"I bring my girlfriend to the dispensary and she buys some for herself, but pot isn't my thing at all."
18-08-2018T16:30:52,Bgrmystr2,"one expereience does not a bad concept make, Rima"
18-08-2018T16:30:57,LannAF,It's so...Underwhelming.
18-08-2018T16:30:57,Bgrmystr2,there's good people out there
18-08-2018T16:30:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I can’t technically drink anyway because of my meds too
18-08-2018T16:31:01,Bgrmystr2,gotta find em
18-08-2018T16:31:02,Xexanoth,What about the souls of the guilty Things?
18-08-2018T16:31:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I just don't drink
18-08-2018T16:31:20,ThingsAreMoving,They're worthless
18-08-2018T16:31:26,LannAF,I don't see the need in drinking or pot or anything
18-08-2018T16:31:27,FenceEqualizer,Drinking isn't really fun
18-08-2018T16:31:28,MrEase,I also don't have any desire to drink
18-08-2018T16:31:30,phil199,that´s the way to go Marv
18-08-2018T16:31:31,Xexanoth,:ptv-whiny:
18-08-2018T16:31:36,Glassan,"Eh, drinking is overrated."
18-08-2018T16:31:45,Afallingtree,There’s nothing wrong with a beer at the end of the day tho
18-08-2018T16:31:45,LannAF,There's one single type of drink I've actually ever liked
18-08-2018T16:31:47,LannAF,and could drink more of
18-08-2018T16:31:50,Glassan,takes a swig of whiskey from his flask. &gt;_&gt;
18-08-2018T16:31:55,Mippy,Even before the meds I cose not to
18-08-2018T16:31:56,LannAF,And that's Captain Morgan's watermelon rum with coke
18-08-2018T16:31:56,phil199,"the bad thing about it is though, that you have to play taxi for your hammered friends"
18-08-2018T16:31:57,Xexanoth,"i mean, it's not really about getting drunk, a nice beer or glass of wine is for the taste"
18-08-2018T16:32:06,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
18-08-2018T16:32:12,LannAF,"Beer tastes terrible to me, and wine is meh at best"
18-08-2018T16:32:14,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I don't know if I would, Phil"
18-08-2018T16:32:15,Katfeathers,laments the lack of mead
18-08-2018T16:32:20,LannAF,so I don't do em for that reason haha
18-08-2018T16:32:21,Bgrmystr2,they drunk themselves under the table
18-08-2018T16:32:26,Bgrmystr2,that's not my responsibility
18-08-2018T16:32:26,thestooge,BRB it's dinner time!
18-08-2018T16:32:28,Xexanoth,beer and wine are a very broad spectrum ^^
18-08-2018T16:32:34,Glassan,"Beer can taste good, but it can also taste bad depending on brewing and taste preferences."
18-08-2018T16:32:41,Xexanoth,"it's like saying ""movies"""
18-08-2018T16:32:41,LannAF,"Yeah, but all of the ones I've tried to this point have tasted bad unfortunately"
18-08-2018T16:32:43,phil199,because they know if they throw up in the car thay´re out wherever we are then ^
18-08-2018T16:32:47,Ordithus,"I enjoy drinks, in moderation.  One with dinner kind of thing"
18-08-2018T16:32:51,microbuss,like Schlitz?
18-08-2018T16:32:53,LannAF,And it's not really something of an interest of mine to go searching for a good one
18-08-2018T16:32:59,FenceEqualizer,Scree that they can Uber or taxi
18-08-2018T16:33:08,Ordithus,Drinking til drunk?  F that.  Awful all around
18-08-2018T16:33:09,FenceEqualizer,Screw*
18-08-2018T16:33:12,Xexanoth,just drink in walking distance of your home
18-08-2018T16:33:14,SpazztasticKiwi,My aunt likes to make watermelon mixer stuff
18-08-2018T16:33:18,microbuss,Schlitz is a baaad tasting beer anyway
18-08-2018T16:33:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure what exactly it is
18-08-2018T16:33:31,phil199,my friend wasted his 20th birthday getting hammered beyond reason
18-08-2018T16:33:43,Glassan,That is certainly a waste.
18-08-2018T16:33:50,BadFoMo,Pet?
18-08-2018T16:33:51,Xexanoth,depends on wether he had fun or not
18-08-2018T16:33:51,Glassan,Particularly if they can't remember anything.
18-08-2018T16:33:57,ThingsAreMoving,"oooooh, rudea waiter"
18-08-2018T16:34:00,ThingsAreMoving,no tip

18-08-2018T16:34:03,ThingsAreMoving,rude*
18-08-2018T16:34:07,Bgrmystr2,wow
18-08-2018T16:34:11,RimaDraws,how rude
18-08-2018T16:34:12,LannAF,"Btw, I'd like to note I'm impressed by the fact this has been civil so far"
18-08-2018T16:34:16,LannAF,despite talking about this stuff
18-08-2018T16:34:20,TorqueEmUp,Well they could just swap seats you know.
18-08-2018T16:34:24,unsteddyphoenix,how dare you just move the kitchen
18-08-2018T16:34:26,ThingsAreMoving,Lann we're good people here
18-08-2018T16:34:28,Xexanoth,Isn't she the princess?
18-08-2018T16:34:35,Bgrmystr2,"he hesitated before saying guest. Rude air quotes are rude, bro"
18-08-2018T16:34:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah Xex
18-08-2018T16:34:43,phil199,"but yeah, a good beer ups the evening by a good amount"
18-08-2018T16:34:53,FenceEqualizer,Switch sits!

18-08-2018T18:44:25,WereKeidran,snap did i miss the third poll?
18-08-2018T18:44:34,TheFDdriver,yep
18-08-2018T18:44:40,HobbitGames,"Whips are thin because the amount of force is applied to less area, hebce more impact."
18-08-2018T18:44:50,Bgrmystr2,can't get a snap with too much volume
18-08-2018T18:44:55,HobbitGames,That is the law of pressure
18-08-2018T18:45:30,WereKeidran,"dang, was too busy playing WoW"
18-08-2018T18:45:40,TheFDdriver,"soo.. the thinner, the better?"
18-08-2018T18:46:03,HobbitGames,"No, not necissarily. But it does help to get it thinner"
18-08-2018T18:46:04,Katfeathers,as I recall
18-08-2018T18:46:22,HobbitGames,You twirl it around for a bit before
18-08-2018T18:46:23,TheFDdriver,thats why you have to twist it
18-08-2018T18:46:24,Bgrmystr2,there's an ideal size with the limitations of gravity and the material you use
18-08-2018T18:46:54,TheFDdriver,leather?
18-08-2018T18:47:00,HobbitGames,Gravity? That has nothing to do with it
18-08-2018T18:47:05,Bgrmystr2,flora's tail is not as spiked as I thought it'd be
18-08-2018T18:47:32,Bgrmystr2,"sure it does, cuz gravity is the reason big things fall apart if they move too quickly"
18-08-2018T18:47:37,Bgrmystr2,cuz they can't hold themselves together
18-08-2018T18:47:43,Bgrmystr2,that's why big whips won't work
18-08-2018T18:47:48,unsteddyphoenix,kat probably cant whip very hard
18-08-2018T18:47:53,TheFDdriver,too much energy
18-08-2018T18:47:53,Bgrmystr2,like the size of a building or whatever
18-08-2018T18:47:55,ThingsAreMoving,you only need gravity to hold you in place as you swing it
18-08-2018T18:48:11,HobbitGames,Gravity is the force that attracts objects of mass towards objects of greater mass. Not what you describe
18-08-2018T18:48:23,legeek22,Manax t'es gros
18-08-2018T18:48:55,Bgrmystr2,then you seem to have missed that part lol
18-08-2018T18:49:11,ThingsAreMoving,That's the ending of Kat's special massage
18-08-2018T18:49:12,TheFDdriver,Kat's Face...
18-08-2018T18:49:16,HobbitGames,What part did who miss?
18-08-2018T18:49:21,ThingsAreMoving,a solid rump whipping
18-08-2018T18:49:30,TheFDdriver,Priceless...
18-08-2018T18:49:46,Bgrmystr2,"if it wasn't obvious hobbit, then I can't help ya xD"
18-08-2018T18:49:55,HobbitGames,???
18-08-2018T18:50:23,TheFDdriver,...
18-08-2018T18:50:28,TheFDdriver,XD
18-08-2018T18:50:33,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
18-08-2018T18:50:35,Kre,Anyone else having any trouble with files downloading automatically when browsing TwoKinds comic?
18-08-2018T18:50:40,unsteddyphoenix,Sends you off with a whip
18-08-2018T18:50:55,TheFDdriver,No Kre
18-08-2018T18:50:57,Kre,I keep getting randome Exe files downloading into my computer
18-08-2018T18:51:08,Bgrmystr2,"sounds like a virus to me, Kre"
18-08-2018T18:51:10,phil199,then you got a problem Kre
18-08-2018T18:51:12,ThingsAreMoving,Kre you need to clean your PC
18-08-2018T18:51:13,Bgrmystr2,the website doesn't have anything like that
18-08-2018T18:51:13,TheFDdriver,delete them
18-08-2018T18:51:22,phil199,what does your anti virus say?
18-08-2018T18:51:42,Bgrmystr2,could be malware
18-08-2018T18:51:48,Kre,"Anti virus says everything is clean, and it only happens on TwoKinds.  though it didnt used to do that"
18-08-2018T18:51:49,Bgrmystr2,somethin an antivirus won't pick up generally
18-08-2018T18:51:51,Afallingtree,What browser are you using
18-08-2018T18:52:16,TheFDdriver,I remember that my Cousin's phone got a virus and it installed a P app
18-08-2018T18:52:23,TheFDdriver,i dont know how
18-08-2018T18:52:30,Kre,Chrome
18-08-2018T18:52:36,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
18-08-2018T18:52:37,MuonNeutrino,"could also be a bad ad, don't know how carefully keenspot curates their ads"
18-08-2018T18:52:44,Ordithus,Sometimes the ads give trouble
18-08-2018T18:52:47,TerraTheWizard,what are the files called/what is the filetype?
18-08-2018T18:52:51,MuonNeutrino,"but yeah, sounds more like a malware"
18-08-2018T18:52:53,Kre,EXE
18-08-2018T18:52:54,TheFDdriver,EXE
18-08-2018T18:53:02,TheFDdriver,delete that shit boii
18-08-2018T18:53:03,Kre,THis last one is called DriverUpdate.EXE
18-08-2018T18:53:06,Afallingtree,"Sometime Crome extensions can do that, not the comic site itself"
18-08-2018T18:53:07,MuonNeutrino,lulz
18-08-2018T18:53:10,MuonNeutrino,that
18-08-2018T18:53:15,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, that sounds like a bad ad"
18-08-2018T18:53:19,Kre,"Oh I do, when I can catch them I cancel the download"
18-08-2018T18:53:23,MuonNeutrino,*that's a really transparent attempt to get you to click them XD
18-08-2018T18:53:29,Afallingtree,It will most likely be adware
18-08-2018T18:53:32,MuonNeutrino,i'm almost insulted they're that bad
18-08-2018T18:53:55,Ordithus,"If you are running anything Vista or newer, they shouldn't automatically run... but it is possible"
18-08-2018T18:53:57,Kre,"What ever it is, it's new because TwoKinds normally didn't do that"
18-08-2018T18:54:06,Kre,running win 10
18-08-2018T18:54:08,Bgrmystr2,you either have malware in your file system or a malware addon bar in your chrome browser
18-08-2018T18:54:10,MuonNeutrino,do you have an adblocker/noscript on your browser?
18-08-2018T18:54:13,Bgrmystr2,it's not the website
18-08-2018T18:54:18,Bgrmystr2,that's your system
18-08-2018T18:54:24,TheFDdriver,Do you have auto-download On on chrome?
18-08-2018T18:54:28,Kre,Nope
18-08-2018T18:54:47,BadFoMo,Back again.
18-08-2018T18:54:50,MuonNeutrino,"cause if you dont have adblock and noscript/equivalent, you really need to get those"
18-08-2018T18:54:53,TheFDdriver,then your PC has a Virus
18-08-2018T18:54:57,Bgrmystr2,wb
18-08-2018T18:54:59,butidontwantto,wb
18-08-2018T18:54:59,TheFDdriver,wb
18-08-2018T18:55:14,TerraTheWizard,goto chrome://extensions & see if there's nothing there that shouldn't be
18-08-2018T18:55:14,MuonNeutrino,"check for adware as well as with a virus scanner, sometimes a scanner looking for one won't find the other"
18-08-2018T18:55:21,Kre,Which is why I asked if anyone else was having trouble with it.
18-08-2018T18:55:26,Tharkis,ublock origins works well for fireforx
18-08-2018T18:55:32,TheFDdriver,nope
18-08-2018T18:55:37,Afallingtree,I think it might just be you
18-08-2018T18:55:38,ThingsAreMoving,"that's a malware most likely, PM'd you one of the solutions"
18-08-2018T18:55:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah just get ublock origin over adblock plus
18-08-2018T18:56:00,Bgrmystr2,I'd recommend Malwarebytes Anti-Malware
18-08-2018T18:56:05,Bgrmystr2,it's a good program :u
18-08-2018T18:56:17,Bgrmystr2,would get rid of shit an antivirus won't find
18-08-2018T18:56:27,TerraTheWizard,if you're on win10 the standard antivirus is good enough these days
18-08-2018T18:56:38,Kre,Have been using bitdefender and its been really good for a number of years
18-08-2018T18:56:38,TheFDdriver,meh
18-08-2018T18:56:39,TerraTheWizard,no need for a 3rd party one
18-08-2018T18:56:48,Bgrmystr2,"lol I wouldn't trust microsoft with shit, Terra xD"
18-08-2018T18:56:54,TheFDdriver,same
18-08-2018T18:56:55,ThingsAreMoving,"srsly I don't know how people get malware, crippling viruses and adware"
18-08-2018T18:57:01,TheFDdriver,thats a straight lie
18-08-2018T18:57:12,Bgrmystr2,it's actually really understandable things
18-08-2018T18:57:14,Kre,"Don'ttrust norton. MCaffey, Microsoft,"
18-08-2018T18:57:23,TheFDdriver,yup
18-08-2018T18:57:26,TerraTheWizard,i know people in IT that say the win10 one is the only good one M$ ever made
18-08-2018T18:57:28,Afallingtree,S
18-08-2018T18:57:28,Afallingtree,Just plz don’t get norton antivirus
18-08-2018T18:57:29,Twokinds,brb water
18-08-2018T18:57:34,ThingsAreMoving,I don't use any antivirus or anti malware software for more than 15 years now

18-08-2018T18:57:56,Bgrmystr2,"lol ""working perfectly"""
18-08-2018T18:57:59,HobbitGames,You really should
18-08-2018T18:58:37,TheFDdriver,or get a VPN?
18-08-2018T18:58:38,Bgrmystr2,"you probably don't do a whole lot of stuff on your computer, do you things?"
18-08-2018T18:58:43,Bgrmystr2,a vpn won't help lol
18-08-2018T18:58:46,TheFDdriver,lol

18-08-2018T18:58:55,ThingsAreMoving,"Bgr, more than I'd like to admit"
18-08-2018T18:59:13,Bgrmystr2,not enough to need an antivirus or antimalware though
18-08-2018T18:59:17,ThingsAreMoving,"but I know every task in my task manager, and I know the distribution of resources in my PC"
18-08-2018T18:59:25,Bgrmystr2,so not a lot in the grand scheme lol
18-08-2018T18:59:56,TheFDdriver,i only need command prompt

18-08-2018T19:52:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wow.  The Mass Effect request is near the bottom.  Who's request is that anyhow?  Just curious?
18-08-2018T19:52:49,BadFoMo,Why am I not shocked to find mine near the bottom again?

18-08-2018T19:53:34,SomeDudeNamedQ,Yes! I liked this idea
18-08-2018T19:53:36,ThingsAreMoving,Crimson there should be some contact details on their site
18-08-2018T19:53:37,Ordithus,"js, crossovers struggle with people knowing what they are"
18-08-2018T19:53:46,CrimsonHelsing,where?
18-08-2018T19:53:48,Bgrmystr2,then maybe you should take advantage of that prose XD
18-08-2018T19:53:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Who Crimson that's bad.  They should have a contact page or something to help you out.
18-08-2018T19:53:53,Mippy,Awwww...I'll try
18-08-2018T19:53:56,SomeDudeNamedQ,I kind of wanted the guys on the nude beach but ok
18-08-2018T19:53:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,*Who
18-08-2018T19:54:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,*Whoa
18-08-2018T19:54:23,SomeDudeNamedQ,"I never vote for crossover ideas. They all just seem lazy and pandering, idk"
18-08-2018T19:54:31,FenceEqualizer,Irony
18-08-2018T19:54:39,Ordithus,"Mike: ""What in the... I was a guy just a minute ago"""

18-08-2018T19:54:59,Bgrmystr2,"as if any of the other ideas are not lazy or pandering, Q?"
18-08-2018T19:55:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know maybe the Mass Effect request could be worded as Male and Female versions of Natani in Mass Effect armor.
18-08-2018T19:55:12,Bgrmystr2,xD It's just a matter of perspective.
18-08-2018T19:55:18,Mippy,"I'll try again next month. Still, good suggestion too whoever suggested this one"
18-08-2018T19:55:21,SomeDudeNamedQ,I think a lot of the cute or character-building ideas are nice
18-08-2018T19:55:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm going to keep on suggesting the AU Family of Sythe and Flora.
18-08-2018T19:55:47,JamesBSquirrel3,"So it is; Evals 'helps' FemMike pick out new summer clothes & beach wear at Kathrin's shop. Wins in 56. As for runners-up, The human explorer hugs one of the snow leopard's fluffy tails, causing a diplomatic incident, defeated."
18-08-2018T19:56:13,unsteddyphoenix,"it can be a crossover and still be character building, arguably"
18-08-2018T19:56:37,JamesBSquirrel3,Well that was a count.:ptv-scratch:
18-08-2018T19:56:37,unsteddyphoenix,"as ""character building"" as a sun sketch can be, anyway"
18-08-2018T19:56:57,Ordithus,Has Florence gotten her body back from Natani?
18-08-2018T19:57:16,HobbitGames,What?
18-08-2018T19:57:17,unsteddyphoenix,never~
18-08-2018T19:57:24,BadFoMo,Maybe.
18-08-2018T19:57:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Once you go flat you cant go back -Natani, probably"
18-08-2018T19:57:46,FenceEqualizer,Nantani is just confuse.
18-08-2018T19:57:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Alright. It was a pleasure watching the stream and chatting with y'all but I gotta bounce. Good night everyone, Thanks for the stream Tom, and as always - be good, people."

18-08-2018T20:00:19,FenceEqualizer,Oh crap. My muscle head general was super low :ptv-sad:
18-08-2018T20:00:32,Bgrmystr2,so just cuz noone had it in their #1 slot doesn't mean noone voted for it
18-08-2018T20:00:42,Bgrmystr2,cuz you can still win like that
