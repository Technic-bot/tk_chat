07-04-2018T00:02:56,BadFoMo,Yo.
07-04-2018T00:15:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"He plays D&D, too. Hot damn - best hooman"
07-04-2018T00:33:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve wanted to try it, but I’ve yet to be able to"
07-04-2018T00:38:40,Vatruvius,Who plays D&D Kiwi?
07-04-2018T00:41:41,unsteddyphoenix,Dnds pretty fun. Recommend trying to get your friends into it if you wanna try.
07-04-2018T00:51:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom apparently
07-04-2018T00:52:07,TorqueEmUp,"I tried, I just can't get into it."
07-04-2018T00:53:52,Vatruvius,D&D is really f7n if you can get a group together to play it. I had a lot of fun with my friends...sadly I do not have a group anymore but I highly recommend try it.
07-04-2018T00:53:58,Vatruvius,fun*
07-04-2018T00:54:11,Bgrmystr2,It's true btw Kiwi. Sage is the one who hosts the games as the Dungeon Master :o
07-04-2018T00:54:30,Bgrmystr2,there's been a couple times they talked about it during the stream
07-04-2018T00:54:53,Bgrmystr2,Fluff's put a piece of art or two on his twitter based on stuff from the D&D games
07-04-2018T00:55:20,Bgrmystr2,"hell, tom did a quick doodle on one of the nora cards before deleting it referencing his character"
07-04-2018T00:56:04,Vatruvius,You have yo tell who he is Bgr! :ptv-excited::ptv-hearts:
07-04-2018T00:56:12,Vatruvius,to*
07-04-2018T00:58:58,Bgrmystr2,"what, tom? He's a purple tentacle dude who can split himself into other parts of himself, but they all have the same mind"
07-04-2018T00:59:12,Bgrmystr2,and if the original one gets dead'd then a copy can take over at any time
07-04-2018T00:59:17,Bgrmystr2,don't recall the name
07-04-2018T00:59:22,Bgrmystr2,"oh wait, it was bob"
07-04-2018T00:59:24,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-04-2018T01:00:17,Bgrmystr2,"bob doesn't seem like a bad guy either, so there's that."
07-04-2018T01:01:23,Bgrmystr2,but that's his D&D character. At least one of em
07-04-2018T01:01:32,Bgrmystr2,I dunno if they started a new campaign since he talked about it
07-04-2018T01:03:16,Vatruvius,Definitely not at all what I expected...I still like regular D&D and have not really ventured beyond that. But thst is cool all the same...and I just finished typing my suggestion from memory as I am on my phone and far away ftom my computer with my sketc
07-04-2018T01:03:34,Vatruvius,suggestions word document.
07-04-2018T01:05:02,Bgrmystr2,they've played a bunch of campaigns
07-04-2018T01:05:04,Bgrmystr2,so
07-04-2018T01:06:11,Vatruvius,I have part of one campaign finished and thrn was kicked out...:ptv-sad:
07-04-2018T01:06:34,Vatruvius,then*
07-04-2018T01:16:35,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
07-04-2018T01:16:37,unsteddyphoenix,What did you do
07-04-2018T01:16:39,unsteddyphoenix,Power gamer?
07-04-2018T01:18:48,Vatruvius,Nah...had a falling out with the best friend which ended with my groip of friends kicking me out which was the same D&D group.
07-04-2018T01:19:18,Vatruvius,My best friend was in the wrong too...so it was all kinds of fucked up.
07-04-2018T01:19:21,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh. Unlucky.
07-04-2018T01:22:16,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
07-04-2018T01:24:27,Vatruvius,Yeah...it sucked. But I still love D&D...they cannot take that away from me. Once I move to a 4-year to gey my BS I will form a D&D group and stuff.
07-04-2018T01:25:01,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah if youre really desperate to play you'll have to be the dm
07-04-2018T01:25:04,unsteddyphoenix,At first at least
07-04-2018T01:25:30,unsteddyphoenix,Luckily there's a bunch of pre-made campaigns on the net
07-04-2018T01:26:37,Vatruvius,I have actually been working on making my own world for D&D but has kinda stalled...in other words it is teally hard. Props to you Tom with Twokinds.
07-04-2018T01:27:38,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah admittedly my own campaign stalled out too. It's easy to think of overarching story but actually writing down specifics can be a chore.
07-04-2018T01:28:05,unsteddyphoenix,Plus one of the members moved away so it was a bit hard
07-04-2018T01:29:13,Vatruvius,Yup...and I went as far as to creste an entire world. Establishing a history and getting a map down is difficult.
07-04-2018T01:30:29,Vatruvius,I couldn't decide so it stoped there. But if I get a group going and we play some of the already mafe csmpaigns and they want more I will put more time into it.
07-04-2018T01:31:01,Vatruvius,made* campaigns* Stupid phone...
07-04-2018T01:41:30,Vatruvius,Well...goodnight everyone! :ptv-greetings: See you all tomorrow!
07-04-2018T01:42:01,unsteddyphoenix,Later
07-04-2018T01:42:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yeah, submit something..."
07-04-2018T01:43:12,Vatruvius,Already did. :ptv-laugh:
07-04-2018T01:43:40,unsteddyphoenix,True.
07-04-2018T01:44:07,unsteddyphoenix,Im still deciding~
07-04-2018T01:45:09,Vatruvius,It is hard whrn uoi hoy more than one idea with only one submission spot.
07-04-2018T01:45:32,Vatruvius,when* you* have*
07-04-2018T01:46:21,Vatruvius,I am going to bed for real this time...goodnight!
07-04-2018T01:46:24,unsteddyphoenix,"S'true, my notepad lsit never seems to get smaller"
07-04-2018T01:46:25,Dadrobit,Night
07-04-2018T01:46:51,Dadrobit,"Same, got two more still on the backburner once my current is finally done."
07-04-2018T01:47:16,Dadrobit,"Brb, gonna go submit it again right now so I don't forget."
07-04-2018T01:47:26,unsteddyphoenix,good call
07-04-2018T01:48:25,Dadrobit,Aaaaand done.
07-04-2018T01:48:40,unsteddyphoenix,What was it
07-04-2018T01:48:42,unsteddyphoenix,Oh wait
07-04-2018T01:48:43,Dadrobit,Alaric and Maddie sparring/fencing. Alaric is getting frustrated as Maddie is impossible to land a hit on.
07-04-2018T01:48:50,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I just remembered
07-04-2018T01:49:10,Dadrobit,"Also, I know that feel on the DnD front. S'hard to get games nowadays."
07-04-2018T01:49:14,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds good to me :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
07-04-2018T01:49:35,Dadrobit,Although I still do head over to the sister's house every now and again for a good mit of MtG.
07-04-2018T01:49:41,Dadrobit,bit*
07-04-2018T01:49:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Lotta people seem to be in the ""kinda interested"" camp but they still basically have to be dragged into it."
07-04-2018T01:49:50,Dadrobit,And thank you.
07-04-2018T01:50:07,Dadrobit,"Eh, I get it. It's kind of a huge time sink."
07-04-2018T01:50:27,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta line up schedules n stuff
07-04-2018T01:50:43,Dadrobit,It's hard to convince people to dedicate a weekly or so timespot that they can just devote to a game.
07-04-2018T01:51:33,Dadrobit,"S'wy I like MtG, easy to drop in and out of since all the games are unique and nice and quick-ish"
07-04-2018T01:51:38,unsteddyphoenix,Even harder to keep the interest as it goes on i've found.
07-04-2018T01:51:50,unsteddyphoenix,So many campaigns dropped at level 3-4 for newer ones
07-04-2018T01:52:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's hard to keep people invested for the eventual payoff."
07-04-2018T01:52:30,unsteddyphoenix,MtG is pricy though
07-04-2018T01:52:55,unsteddyphoenix,And its hard to be a lvl 18 demigod in it
07-04-2018T01:54:01,Dadrobit,I guess it can be.
07-04-2018T01:54:13,Dadrobit,Friday night magic drafts are pretty fun tho
07-04-2018T01:54:36,Dadrobit,Spend $10 and get a bunch of booster packs everyone drafts from to create new decks to use for the night.
07-04-2018T01:55:46,unsteddyphoenix,That's a whole few sketch requests! :O
07-04-2018T01:56:13,unsteddyphoenix,$10 each? You must really pile up those cards
07-04-2018T01:57:11,Dadrobit,:/ My sister has a dedicated entertainment system full of them.
07-04-2018T01:57:50,Dadrobit,"Filing boxes just full of land cards, and everything else perfectly organized and itemized."
07-04-2018T01:58:07,unsteddyphoenix,Im very jealous of your nerd assets
07-04-2018T01:58:55,Dadrobit,It's pretty swagtastic.
07-04-2018T01:59:16,unsteddyphoenix,Thats definitely a word
07-04-2018T02:00:02,Dadrobit,Pretty sure that's valid in Scrabble.
07-04-2018T02:00:37,unsteddyphoenix,Next time youre in a pro tournament bust it out
07-04-2018T02:00:55,unsteddyphoenix,Have you heard pro scrabble players talk about scrabble? It's weirdly interesting.
07-04-2018T02:01:10,Dadrobit,'Course I haven't been to a FNM draft in forever since Tom streams most times.
07-04-2018T02:01:39,Dadrobit,"Scrabble used to be huge in my family, but I can't say we were professionals."
07-04-2018T02:01:42,unsteddyphoenix,How inconsiderate.
07-04-2018T02:02:04,Dadrobit,"Tom, change your shit to Thursdays so I can go get more cards!"
07-04-2018T02:02:07,Dadrobit,pls
07-04-2018T02:03:06,unsteddyphoenix,"""Fuck it, NO Schedules"""
07-04-2018T02:03:14,Dadrobit,I need me some holographics.
07-04-2018T02:03:40,Twokinds,"Okay, I got that conversation mixed up"
07-04-2018T02:04:01,Dadrobit,?
07-04-2018T02:04:04,Twokinds,"I thought someone had combined a TCG with scrabble. Like, you play advanced, holographic letters."
07-04-2018T02:04:26,Twokinds,New letters!
07-04-2018T02:04:30,Dadrobit,The fanciest Scrabble ever
07-04-2018T02:04:33,unsteddyphoenix,That...sounds amazing actually
07-04-2018T02:04:41,Dadrobit,I'm sure it exists.
07-04-2018T02:04:54,unsteddyphoenix,But is there a super-dramatic anime about it
07-04-2018T02:05:06,Twokinds,"It's the legendary ""th"" card!"
07-04-2018T02:05:08,Twokinds,So useful!
07-04-2018T02:05:29,unsteddyphoenix,!! NANI!? HE HAS THAT RARE PIECE?
07-04-2018T02:05:48,unsteddyphoenix,With that he can reach the DOUBLE WORD SCORE!! :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
07-04-2018T02:05:51,Dadrobit,"Crap, searching ""holographic scrabble"" only brings up people asking if holographic is a valid word in scrabble...."
07-04-2018T02:06:28,unsteddyphoenix,2000 letter chinese alphabet expansion pack
07-04-2018T02:06:31,Twokinds,"Little does he know, attaching to my word activates my word's trap card."
07-04-2018T02:06:48,Dadrobit,NANI?
07-04-2018T02:07:11,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:*[such a complex maneuver! He']
07-04-2018T02:07:55,unsteddyphoenix,"The climax of the season will be the protag spelling the word ""friendship"" to win the game"
07-04-2018T02:08:31,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah. I'd watch that.
07-04-2018T02:10:31,Dadrobit,I feel like I watched a part of an episode if IT Crowd where that was the story.
07-04-2018T02:11:10,Dadrobit,It was like a back alley/underground scrabble contest or something.
07-04-2018T02:11:15,unsteddyphoenix,Ive...vaguely heard about that show
07-04-2018T02:11:19,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
07-04-2018T02:11:32,unsteddyphoenix,Illegal underground street scrabble
07-04-2018T02:11:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, never actually seen a full episode, but my brother used to watch it, so I caught snippets."
07-04-2018T02:17:05,Dadrobit,"Holy crap, looking on amazon for cards, if you ever want to get in, people sell their common/uncommon cards by the thousand, 'bout $14."
07-04-2018T02:17:46,unsteddyphoenix,Hoo~
07-04-2018T02:17:59,unsteddyphoenix,There is a nerd-shop around here I could play I suppose
07-04-2018T02:19:16,Twokinds,No way man
07-04-2018T02:19:21,Twokinds,Can't do it again. Not again.
07-04-2018T02:19:37,Dadrobit,Lol
07-04-2018T02:20:02,unsteddyphoenix,What is this card game trauma
07-04-2018T02:20:42,Dadrobit,The card game itself? Or going to a nerd shop?
07-04-2018T02:23:36,Twokinds,lol
07-04-2018T02:23:51,Twokinds,So many allowances... wasted...
07-04-2018T02:24:06,Dadrobit,Hahahahaha.
07-04-2018T02:24:31,Dadrobit,"That hurts, yeah."
07-04-2018T02:24:58,unsteddyphoenix,I guess there's so many cheap cards online for a reason...
07-04-2018T02:25:13,Twokinds,"Though, admittedly, I wasted way more money on anime dvds"
07-04-2018T02:25:41,Twokinds,"Man those things were so expensive. Like, 20 bucks for a DVD with maybe 3-4 episodes."
07-04-2018T02:26:08,unsteddyphoenix,I...didnt even know that was a thing.
07-04-2018T02:26:20,Twokinds,Yeah
07-04-2018T02:26:36,unsteddyphoenix,"I know you can buy the manga in those little books, but I just read them online"
07-04-2018T02:26:54,Twokinds,Well... that wasn't really an option back then.
07-04-2018T02:27:01,Bgrmystr2,I still buy the books and the dvds. :v
07-04-2018T02:27:05,Dadrobit,"Didn't really get an allowance. All my money came from birthday, Christmas, or Hanukkah. So I had to make it last and used it on big things, like my first TV and computer."
07-04-2018T02:27:15,unsteddyphoenix,Same
07-04-2018T02:27:25,unsteddyphoenix,You cant waste your allowance if you dont get one :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
07-04-2018T02:27:43,Bgrmystr2,I never got an allowance since I was like.. 5 or 6 years old or something
07-04-2018T02:28:00,Bgrmystr2,and that was before I got my computer
07-04-2018T02:28:08,Bgrmystr2,so I never got to spend it on fun stuff :V
07-04-2018T02:28:11,Twokinds,I remember I started out at 2 dollars / week
07-04-2018T02:28:14,Dadrobit,"Also, yeah, I remember those 4-5 episodes stuff."
07-04-2018T02:28:35,unsteddyphoenix,And climbed the allowance corporate ladder?
07-04-2018T02:28:43,Twokinds,"It went up to $10 / week, though for a while, we had to give up allowances when we were going through rough times."
07-04-2018T02:28:52,Bgrmystr2,"I was lucky to get $1 a week, and I had to do ridiculous amount of chores :/"
07-04-2018T02:28:56,Dadrobit,I remember being heartbroken when I got a Pokemon VHS that I thought was the first Pokemon movie and it turned out to just be 4 random episodes.
07-04-2018T02:28:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, the business went under."
07-04-2018T02:29:21,Twokinds,Yeah
07-04-2018T02:29:35,Bgrmystr2,I kinda envy your guys' ability to spend money as a kid :u
07-04-2018T02:30:03,Twokinds,It really makes me realize in retrospect how bad things were at the time. My dad did a lot to hide it.
07-04-2018T02:30:39,Twokinds,He would promise to reemburse all the allowances later.
07-04-2018T02:30:59,Dadrobit,"Yeah, single dad, he tried doing a ""gift"" allowance thing for a while where if we did all our chores for a month, we got to pick out a toy from a collection that he bought, but they were all dollar store things and we were like ""yo, where's the Playstatio"
07-04-2018T02:31:02,unsteddyphoenix,They probably racked up
07-04-2018T02:31:04,Dadrobit,"Playstation games?"""
07-04-2018T02:31:33,Dadrobit,"Greedy little bastards that we were, but he was doin' his best."
07-04-2018T02:32:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol. We were never in trouble since the government helped out my single mother, but we werent able to spend frivolously"
07-04-2018T02:32:17,BluePhantom90,hmm
07-04-2018T02:32:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, when I saved up a bought a preowned PS2, and it turned out it was chipped."
07-04-2018T02:32:47,Dadrobit,chipped?
07-04-2018T02:33:03,unsteddyphoenix,Modified to be able to play copied games
07-04-2018T02:33:11,Dadrobit,Ohhhhhh~
07-04-2018T02:33:21,unsteddyphoenix,I was a tiny criminal but man it was great
07-04-2018T02:33:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Before that had like, 3 games"
07-04-2018T02:34:39,Dadrobit,"I remember when my brother and I pooled our Birthday monies to get a PS2, it was legitimately the best thing ever, even though we didn't have any games for like a month before dad got us a racing game."
07-04-2018T02:34:51,Dadrobit,We were just using it as a CD player
07-04-2018T02:35:04,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
07-04-2018T02:35:11,unsteddyphoenix,I'd borrow my wealthier friends games
07-04-2018T02:35:37,Dadrobit,And admiring the amazing PS screen floaty box thingy that was on the TV when nothing was in the system.
07-04-2018T02:36:45,Dadrobit,"Simpler times man, simpler times..."
07-04-2018T02:38:05,unsteddyphoenix,The ps loading sound is burned into my memory
07-04-2018T02:39:21,Dadrobit,I hope that audio designer got mad money for it.
07-04-2018T02:39:50,BluePhantom90,"you know Tom I have wondered, The Furry porn has gotten popular lately, Have you thought about drawing 18+ comics for a while? Not saying do them just wondering"
07-04-2018T02:40:21,Dadrobit,"Hello left field, nice to see you're still around."
07-04-2018T02:40:45,BluePhantom90,"yes I am still around, you all woke me up"
07-04-2018T02:41:05,unsteddyphoenix,I am full of regret
07-04-2018T02:41:54,Bgrmystr2,how exactly did we wake you up? The chat doesn't make any sounds when people respond.
07-04-2018T02:42:21,BluePhantom90,when you set it up to make sound when people chat it can
07-04-2018T02:42:40,Bgrmystr2,there's no option for that though. Only for when people start streaming
07-04-2018T02:42:52,Bgrmystr2,and it doesn't make any noise either :c
07-04-2018T02:43:07,BluePhantom90,"nope, go to settings and click sound"
07-04-2018T02:43:21,Bgrmystr2,"there is no ""sound"""
07-04-2018T02:43:25,Dadrobit,Why would you do that though?
07-04-2018T02:44:06,Dadrobit,And why is that the first question in your head after waking up?
07-04-2018T02:44:15,BluePhantom90,-shrugs- Just tells me people are chatting. If I hear it too much I would turn it off
07-04-2018T02:44:28,Bgrmystr2,people are always chatting though
07-04-2018T02:44:29,BluePhantom90,T-T I was bored
07-04-2018T02:44:32,Bgrmystr2,like 90% of the time
07-04-2018T02:44:38,Bgrmystr2,"you were not bored, you were sleeping xD"
07-04-2018T02:44:49,Bgrmystr2,suddenly the story changes lol
07-04-2018T02:45:57,BluePhantom90,"I was bored when I fell asleep and since it was 3am. I thought ""Hey I could ask a R rated question"" since most kids would be asleep"
07-04-2018T02:46:06,unsteddyphoenix,Cut through this web of liiiiies
07-04-2018T02:46:31,Bgrmystr2,xD uh
07-04-2018T02:47:11,Dadrobit,"Whoops, kitty was yelling at me, back now."
07-04-2018T02:47:17,Bgrmystr2,wb
07-04-2018T02:47:34,Dadrobit,She wanted exactly 4 pets.
07-04-2018T02:47:34,BluePhantom90,lol I mean if you go deep enough Tom dose have a lot of rated R art. Someone happen to lead me too
07-04-2018T02:50:08,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. Tom's entire comic could be somewhere between PG-13 and R, presuming it were a movie"
07-04-2018T02:50:09,Bgrmystr2,but it's not
07-04-2018T02:51:05,unsteddyphoenix,How many pets did you give?
07-04-2018T02:51:10,BluePhantom90,Nope Tom did do some more r-r graphic rated R art
07-04-2018T02:51:17,Dadrobit,"5, I regret that decision."
07-04-2018T02:51:24,unsteddyphoenix,You have ERRD
07-04-2018T02:53:40,BluePhantom90,I just assumed Tom didn't want to go that route because of family. I mean who would want their mom to find out lol
07-04-2018T02:54:53,Bgrmystr2,"lots of artists who draw adult art have told their family, Blue"
07-04-2018T02:54:58,Bgrmystr2,it's a job.
07-04-2018T02:55:05,Bgrmystr2,so what lol
07-04-2018T02:55:56,Dadrobit,"Hell, my first paying job was in porn, the folks get a helluva kick out of that."
07-04-2018T02:56:24,Dadrobit,#MostlyTrueStory
07-04-2018T02:57:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Or you could just not tell them, just say art"
07-04-2018T02:57:30,BluePhantom90,Eh Well just wanted to know why Tom didn't go that route is all. I mean one guy is getting paid 11K just for furry porn lol
07-04-2018T02:58:22,Bgrmystr2,"lol phoenix, then they'll wanna see"
07-04-2018T02:58:29,Bgrmystr2,it only creates curiosity
07-04-2018T02:58:49,unsteddyphoenix,Show them something sfw
07-04-2018T02:59:08,unsteddyphoenix,I remember an artist on Fluffs stream saying they did that
07-04-2018T02:59:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Sent them a SFW pic and said ""Do not ask any further"""
07-04-2018T03:00:18,BluePhantom90,lol
07-04-2018T03:00:31,Bgrmystr2,oh yeah I remember that
07-04-2018T03:00:51,Bgrmystr2,"that was.. no, It was Watsup"
07-04-2018T03:00:52,Dadrobit,Abandon all hope ye whe question further...
07-04-2018T03:00:54,Bgrmystr2,I was thinking it was Scappo
07-04-2018T03:00:59,Bgrmystr2,but it was Wats
07-04-2018T03:01:27,unsteddyphoenix,Tips from the pros
07-04-2018T03:09:04,Dadrobit,"Oh shit, Day9 is playtesting a new MtG online Arena. There goes my plans for tomorrow."
07-04-2018T03:18:28,unsteddyphoenix,Gwent looks pretty cool as far as online card games go
07-04-2018T03:19:23,Dadrobit,"Gwent was fun, but it was never a huge focus of my playthrough."
07-04-2018T03:19:38,Dadrobit,"Always meant to go back and really delve into it, but never got around to it."
07-04-2018T03:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,"The actual card games a bit different, but it's fun."
07-04-2018T03:20:16,unsteddyphoenix,Just noone I knew played it so I gave it up~
07-04-2018T03:20:32,Dadrobit,I think I actually stopped playing my second run of W3 for Elder Scrolls Legends actually.
07-04-2018T03:20:50,Dadrobit,Actually redundant
07-04-2018T03:21:08,unsteddyphoenix,Legends?
07-04-2018T03:21:13,unsteddyphoenix,IS that different from online?
07-04-2018T03:21:40,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's an Elder Scrolls collectible card game."
07-04-2018T03:21:59,Dadrobit,It's actually pretty fun and has some unique rulesets.
07-04-2018T03:22:01,BluePhantom90,"should play ""Exploding Kittens"" card game. Its a lot of fun"
07-04-2018T03:22:54,Dadrobit,"Where usually you just have one board to place all your nerds, ESL splits it up into two separate areas that you have to manage where different areas do different things to your cards."
07-04-2018T03:23:32,Dadrobit,And of course all the cards are references to Elder Scrolls stuff.
07-04-2018T03:26:35,unsteddyphoenix,two boards!!
07-04-2018T03:26:41,unsteddyphoenix,Revolutionary
07-04-2018T03:29:57,Dadrobit,"It's fun because you can't just ignore a lane, you have to really get your strategy on."
07-04-2018T03:30:31,BluePhantom90,same with Exploding Kittens.
07-04-2018T03:33:14,Dadrobit,"ESL has combusting khajiit. And that's alliteration, so automatically better."
07-04-2018T03:44:29,unsteddyphoenix,I do enjoy some cheeky strategy
07-04-2018T03:47:11,Dadrobit,"Mmmmm, bait out a bunch of blockers with a huge nerd on one side, then spell him over to the other lane at the last second and get your damage on."
07-04-2018T03:48:20,unsteddyphoenix,The ol' huge nerd global taunt
07-04-2018T03:48:40,Dadrobit,Classic strat.
07-04-2018T12:32:41,BluePhantom90,So who is alive and who all is dead

07-04-2018T14:59:54,NeonMitsumi,Wasn't character count enough?

07-04-2018T15:00:20,NeonMitsumi,7 paragraphs? Is Moppy writing stuff again?
07-04-2018T15:00:27,ProsePro7,There already is a limit it says a few sentences
07-04-2018T15:00:47,Shurtugalskulblaka,At least mine was short and sweet XD I honestly don’t like suggesting art artists should have free roam on their work :P
07-04-2018T15:00:51,Dadrobit,I feel bad just doing two sentances.
07-04-2018T15:00:56,Twokinds,I'm going to have to make it like 120 characters. People will have to actually think about the words they use.
07-04-2018T15:01:04,Bgrmystr2,7 paragraphs can be seven sentences.. but they'd need to be long as hell..
07-04-2018T15:01:20,ProsePro7,Thus stupid ruins it for the rest of us once again
07-04-2018T15:01:25,NeonMitsumi,Cheeky.

07-04-2018T15:01:45,Vatruvius,I am all for a character limit.
07-04-2018T15:01:48,MefjuTK,hi guys
07-04-2018T15:01:55,ProsePro7,Greetings
07-04-2018T15:02:07,qwe304,i think mine was a bit too long...
07-04-2018T15:02:08,TorqueEmUp,"Really it's best to keep it short anyway, I am not going to sit there and read a stupidly long suggestion"
07-04-2018T15:02:29,NightMeaty22,hows every body doing on this fine day
07-04-2018T15:02:31,MrEase,"I kinda want to make a joke like ""Tom's willing to spend time drawing 120 characters! WOW"""
07-04-2018T15:02:34,thestooge,Character limit for what? The suggestions?
07-04-2018T15:02:35,NeonMitsumi,"@qwe304 6,5 pharagraphs too long?"
07-04-2018T15:02:42,Bgrmystr2,"you're not reading any suggestions at all torque, so I'm pretty sure that's irrelevant xD"
07-04-2018T15:02:54,Tharkis,"""tweet your idea for Tom to draw"" sounds more reasonable than any number of paragraphs lol"
07-04-2018T15:02:54,InTheLionsDen,"Have them include a drawing, inked."
07-04-2018T15:02:56,BadFoMo,120 sound a little too short.
07-04-2018T15:02:57,MrEase,But I also need to acknowledge that that joke is stupid
07-04-2018T15:03:07,NeonMitsumi,Dammit Ease
07-04-2018T15:03:21,Tharkis,"given how muchtime is allocated to eatch sketch, if you cant express it in 120 your idea is probably too complex anyways"
07-04-2018T15:03:30,TorqueEmUp,^
07-04-2018T15:03:46,ProsePro7,The stream is delayed because Tom has to finish reading all of the five page suggestions he got
07-04-2018T15:03:53,BadFoMo,But grammer!
07-04-2018T15:03:57,Bgrmystr2,tom's drawn way more than 120 characters.
07-04-2018T15:04:08,Combak,I don't know...
07-04-2018T15:04:09,Bgrmystr2,They just weren't all in the same sketch
07-04-2018T15:04:17,Bgrmystr2,it wasn't required to be in the same one.
07-04-2018T15:04:22,Bgrmystr2,was never specified :V
07-04-2018T15:04:27,MefjuTK,Whats going on?
07-04-2018T15:04:33,Combak,"I'm not sure if there's been 120 characters, even if you do count background ones."
07-04-2018T15:04:33,MrEase,120 sounds fine
07-04-2018T15:04:48,Bgrmystr2,"you can cound the same characters twice, combak"
07-04-2018T15:04:50,MrEase,People should be able to get their ideas into that
07-04-2018T15:04:52,ProsePro7,Here we go internet telephone
07-04-2018T15:04:52,Bgrmystr2,if he draws them again
07-04-2018T15:04:57,Bgrmystr2,that's another character drawing
07-04-2018T15:04:58,BadFoMo,Why not 256?
07-04-2018T15:05:00,NeonMitsumi,Or 8 times. *cough* Maeve
07-04-2018T15:05:04,Bgrmystr2,"because that's colors, Fomo"
07-04-2018T15:05:05,TerraTheWizard,lol
07-04-2018T15:05:13,BadFoMo,So?
07-04-2018T15:05:14,DarthKeidran,There are a lot of good suggestions today (based on the comments on the suggestion link)
07-04-2018T15:05:29,Bgrmystr2,these are characters Fomo. Colors and characters are different. :P

07-04-2018T15:39:25,Vatruvius,Would Nora be considered a grandma because of her age? I mean...she is old but to dragons does that mean she is a grandma?
07-04-2018T15:39:41,Vatruvius,"Ignoring actually having grandchildren dragons, etc."
07-04-2018T15:39:46,MrEase,"Like, she was there when Trace was a murder machine, and she was okay with it because she got off to how much magic he has"
07-04-2018T15:39:51,unsteddyphoenix,Why ignoring that
07-04-2018T15:40:02,unsteddyphoenix,thats the whole criteria of grandma-ing
07-04-2018T15:40:04,Vatruvius,Nora was there before Murder Trace

07-04-2018T15:44:47,MviluUatusun,"Me, Vatru?  I'm all guy.  At least I was the last time I checked."
07-04-2018T15:44:49,Xexanoth,"Nora: seriously, i'm full can you come back later....also cover yourself in BBQ sauce"
07-04-2018T15:45:04,Ordithus,"Darth, you do realize, Trace is a child in this."
07-04-2018T15:45:15,Xexanoth,everyone is a child to Nora

07-04-2018T15:48:01,MviluUatusun,"And to anybody who may have made the comment, no, I didn't change into my birthday suit.  I've seen me in my birthday suit.  It ain't nothing to write home about."
07-04-2018T15:48:05,DarthKeidran,"Also, @Combak Trace could be older. we don't know yet how old he was"
07-04-2018T15:48:08,Bgrmystr2,pity my birthday isn't on a sunday

07-04-2018T15:50:28,NeonMitsumi,@darthkeidran Yes.
07-04-2018T15:50:38,Vatruvius,I think Kat can hypnotize people without spinning like that.
07-04-2018T15:50:55,Ordithus,"Take this, Tom --&gt; :hammer:"
07-04-2018T15:51:14,ProsePro7,Is it dangerous to go alone?

07-04-2018T15:51:36,DarthKeidran,@Vatruvius Kat really can. She is kind of my waifu up until she actually gets with someone who cares about her properly.
07-04-2018T15:51:53,MefjuTK,something moving but shouldn't? Use ducktape.
07-04-2018T15:51:55,NeonMitsumi,lmao gj
07-04-2018T15:52:04,ZephyrTWolffox,"now now, you know you're supposed to arm people with wooden swords when its REALLY dangerous!"
07-04-2018T15:52:12,MefjuTK,something not moving but should? use hammer
07-04-2018T15:52:17,MviluUatusun,Something that ain't moving and should?  Use WD-40.
07-04-2018T15:52:19,ThingsAreMoving,"Something stuck, but it should be moving? use wd-40"
07-04-2018T15:52:32,ThingsAreMoving,beat me to it
07-04-2018T15:52:34,MefjuTK,"thats the other way, Things"
07-04-2018T15:52:34,Vatruvius,Well...about 10 years in and Kat is still alone. However...you will be fighting others to have Kat including me.
07-04-2018T15:52:50,MviluUatusun,"I am a guy, Things.  I know these things."
07-04-2018T15:52:52,NeonMitsumi,facepaws.

07-04-2018T15:53:22,ThingsAreMoving,ha
07-04-2018T15:53:59,DarthKeidran,"@Vatruvius Of course I'll have to fight people. SAO style Full Dive VR will exist by then, so someone could legitimately have a relationship with Kat"
07-04-2018T15:54:12,DarthKeidran,"Like, Intimate relationship."
07-04-2018T15:54:24,NeonMitsumi,@DarthKeidran Calm down lmao
07-04-2018T15:54:35,ThingsAreMoving,the future is full of possibilities
07-04-2018T15:54:40,totallynotTrace,something not moving that should but is SUPER stuck? wd-40 + hammer + (optional) 2 ft long wrench= movement
07-04-2018T15:55:15,totallynotTrace,*diclaimer: does not work on living things
07-04-2018T15:55:18,ZephyrTWolffox,and Housekeeping's wet-vac hose is STILL stuck
07-04-2018T15:55:21,ThingsAreMoving,i can comfirm
07-04-2018T15:55:37,MviluUatusun,"Well, the 2 foot long wrench would."
07-04-2018T15:55:39,ThingsAreMoving,things don't need hammers to be in motion
07-04-2018T15:55:45,CanisRufusUK,"If it doesnt move and should = WD40, if it moves and shouldnt = Duct tape"

07-04-2018T15:55:57,Bgrmystr2,"If you put WD-40 on the hammer, will it still stop on things that are not moving..? :thinking:"
07-04-2018T15:56:04,Xexanoth,https://imgur.com/gallery/dXOTaTi someone say wd40?
07-04-2018T15:56:23,ThingsAreMoving,you put wd40 on a hammer then the head will slide of the shaft and klill someone
07-04-2018T15:56:30,ThingsAreMoving,kill even

07-04-2018T15:57:10,Nillalee113,anyone know how often you should replace the nib of your stylus?
07-04-2018T15:57:17,Nillalee113,on like a table?
07-04-2018T15:57:21,Nillalee113,tablet* sorry
07-04-2018T15:57:31,Bgrmystr2,about 6 or 7 lengths of time?
07-04-2018T15:57:39,DarthKeidran,"@Nillalee113 when it wears down, or you've chewed on it too much when thinking."
07-04-2018T15:57:54,Twokinds,Uh... I usually find myself replacing them maybe 1 or 2 times a year?
07-04-2018T15:58:04,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, see :u"
07-04-2018T15:58:09,Vatruvius,Chewing on a stylus sounds expensive.
07-04-2018T15:58:11,DarthKeidran,@Nillalee113 what tom said.
07-04-2018T15:58:20,ZephyrTWolffox,depends on how much you draw
07-04-2018T15:58:24,MuonNeutrino,"of course, tom draws a lot. like, a real lot &gt;.&gt;"
07-04-2018T15:58:31,Nillalee113,You're the coolest tom. Thank you sooooo much
07-04-2018T15:58:43,BadFoMo,I never replace mine. ...Mostly due not owning one.
07-04-2018T15:58:53,Bgrmystr2,Same Fomo
07-04-2018T15:58:56,DarthKeidran,"@Vatruvius I don't have a stylus to do that to. I was just saying that because they are slightly rubbery, and people chew on their erasers all the time."
07-04-2018T15:59:01,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder how many miles of lines Tom draws every year
07-04-2018T15:59:08,Vatruvius,Thanks for the assistance FoMo.
07-04-2018T15:59:09,NeonMitsumi,At least 3
07-04-2018T15:59:19,MviluUatusun,"At least 3 or 4, Things.  That would be my guess."
07-04-2018T15:59:26,Tharkis,dragons are just like extra large scaled flying cats
07-04-2018T15:59:28,unsteddyphoenix,plausible
07-04-2018T15:59:35,DarthKeidran,@ThingsAreMoving enough to circle the earth a few times I would say
07-04-2018T15:59:44,Tharkis,"same sense of superiority, same tendency to sleep all the time, same desire to curl up in warm places, etc"
07-04-2018T15:59:50,Bgrmystr2,"that is technically at least 3 miles, Darth"
07-04-2018T15:59:52,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 We are of the Mouse and Keyboard Master Race?
07-04-2018T15:59:57,Vatruvius,I was about to say...3 or 4 miles sounds like to little.
07-04-2018T16:00:03,Bgrmystr2,"I don't draw Fomo, so there's that :P"
07-04-2018T16:00:37,Vatruvius,Nibbly Nora
07-04-2018T16:01:00,MviluUatusun,"Vatru, you think that Nibbly is Nora?  Hmm.  Interesting."
07-04-2018T16:01:01,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 Same.
07-04-2018T16:01:19,DarthKeidran,"@Vatruvius  Definitely too little. Just a few months of using swift key, and it says my thumb has moved over 2 KM on the little 3""x2"" space the keyboard takes up."
07-04-2018T16:01:31,Vatruvius,No...just the way Tom drew Nora's foot there looked like Nibbly's but now he erased it.
07-04-2018T16:01:37,Nekonny,o/
07-04-2018T16:01:48,ThingsAreMoving,o/
07-04-2018T16:01:49,qwe304,an interesting statistic to have (though likely unfeasible) is how many miles tom has dragged the styles across his tablest over the years
07-04-2018T16:01:51,BadFoMo,Yo.
07-04-2018T16:01:53,ZephyrTWolffox,dragon w/skwirrelfeets
07-04-2018T16:01:53,Bgrmystr2,"then yes, I guess. Mouse and Keyboard Master Race. Unless I'm using a controller or steering wheel, but that's more of racing lines, not drawing lines. A line is a line though :thinking:"

07-04-2018T16:02:44,NeonMitsumi,Heya Ron!
07-04-2018T16:02:59,DarthKeidran,make it so that in the wacom tablet's settings it shows distance traveled by the stylus tips.
07-04-2018T16:03:10,Vatruvius,What is your avatar looking at Nekonny to warrant that facial expression?
07-04-2018T16:03:29,DarthKeidran,Nora: What do you want?Trace
07-04-2018T16:03:30,Bgrmystr2,"It's VR, Vatru"
07-04-2018T16:03:36,Bgrmystr2,what do you expect?

07-04-2018T16:03:54,ThingsAreMoving,dragons aren't liquid
07-04-2018T16:04:11,unsteddyphoenix,are we sure
07-04-2018T16:04:16,Vatruvius,My reaction would not be like that Bgr...it would be cool but not like that. I was more so asking what he was looking at in VR.
07-04-2018T16:04:17,BadFoMo,@DarthKeidran Trace: You know my nake :D?!

07-04-2018T16:04:35,totallynotTrace,they can change shape so maybe they are liquid if they choose

07-04-2018T16:43:35,Kamaro12,was she raised by eastern basitins or did she live amongst western
07-04-2018T16:43:37,Xexanoth,she was a western basitin who fell in love with an eastern basitin
07-04-2018T16:43:37,Kynum,did she have tats?
07-04-2018T16:43:38,Combak,"Oh, where those three Basitins that trio from WAY back in your dA history?"
07-04-2018T16:43:38,Kamaro12,"unsteddy, I know"
07-04-2018T16:43:39,BadFoMo,@thestooge That was TDM?
07-04-2018T16:43:44,Kamaro12,what I'm curious about is how she was raised
07-04-2018T16:43:45,ZephyrTWolffox,Carver better not get any tail from this...
07-04-2018T16:43:46,unsteddyphoenix,Im helping~
07-04-2018T16:43:49,thestooge,I know someone paid for it
07-04-2018T16:43:49,DarthKeidran,@thestooge you are a patron right?
07-04-2018T16:43:55,Kamaro12,"because in the sketch where she meets keith's dad, she doesn't look tribal at all"
07-04-2018T16:43:58,Vatruvius,I will be honest...I saw Carvar and thought Clovis...still slightly salty about the Keith and Clovis scene...
07-04-2018T16:44:03,MuonNeutrino,"so, i'm assuming that you didn't have THIS particular role for them in mind that long ago. had you thought them up for some particular reason, or just character designs?"
07-04-2018T16:44:05,DarthKeidran,@thestooge If so. Let me get you the link.
07-04-2018T16:44:09,unsteddyphoenix,They dont all look the same in the west
07-04-2018T16:44:23,ThingsAreMoving,No unity in the west
07-04-2018T16:44:30,Xexanoth,"also, she maybe dressed up as a eastern basitin to get closer to him"
07-04-2018T16:44:36,DRAGONTANOPUG,What is this one
07-04-2018T16:44:42,Kamaro12,"unsteddy: well yeah, but she looked closer to eastern basitin than whatever is a central image of western"
07-04-2018T16:44:43,thestooge,No this was back on the kickstarter for the first two books
07-04-2018T16:44:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,Is that alaric
07-04-2018T16:44:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
07-04-2018T16:44:58,unsteddyphoenix,"I imagine those that live close to the ""border"" could look like easterners"
07-04-2018T16:45:00,DRAGONTANOPUG,Whats the request
07-04-2018T16:45:07,Kamaro12,maybe
07-04-2018T16:45:13,Kamaro12,it's making me more curious about that character
07-04-2018T16:45:21,Kamaro12,do we already have backstory for her?
07-04-2018T16:45:30,Kamaro12,besides her being western anyways

07-04-2018T16:48:40,NeonMitsumi,@thestooge The statue was on the square
07-04-2018T16:48:44,Combak,That was the Shepard's Square

07-04-2018T16:49:22,Vatruvius,Who had $1000?
07-04-2018T16:49:33,ThingsAreMoving,I did
07-04-2018T16:49:39,ThingsAreMoving,but it wasn'\t me who donated
07-04-2018T16:49:56,Vatruvius,You have $1000 you would donate?
07-04-2018T16:50:09,thestooge,Then who did?
07-04-2018T16:50:12,DarthKeidran,Not necessarily. The story of the character in the statue at shepherd's square hasn't been told yet. I could soon. You just don't know.
07-04-2018T16:50:13,NeonMitsumi,Actually was 5000$

07-04-2018T16:51:29,DarthKeidran,@ThingsAreMoving JK. I know what you mean. I couldn't afford a nora card even if I wanted it.
07-04-2018T16:51:30,BadFoMo,@DarthKeidran ...Yes.
07-04-2018T16:51:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Darth not more important than my financial security, lol"

07-04-2018T16:52:25,Ordithus,That's not really what'll stop you from getting a Nora card
07-04-2018T16:52:28,ThingsAreMoving,Nora cards are hard to come by afaik
07-04-2018T16:52:32,MviluUatusun,"Darth, I've got a job and I can't afford a Nora card."
07-04-2018T16:52:33,Ordithus,It's the fact that they're never available
07-04-2018T16:52:36,DarthKeidran,That's true.
07-04-2018T16:53:07,Vatruvius,I would not get a Nora Card unless I knew what I wanted done or I had a really nice job. For now I will stick with simple $10 a month.
07-04-2018T16:53:24,DarthKeidran,"I was making $16/hr at my last job. If I can get another around that, and actually collect rent from my family, I would be able to afford it."

07-04-2018T18:41:57,ThingsAreMoving,true
07-04-2018T18:42:19,WereKeidran,there has been many times that he has picked something other than the runner up

07-04-2018T18:43:45,DarthKeidran,Could be flora.
07-04-2018T18:43:47,Combak,It's probably a good thing if he doesn't though.

07-04-2018T18:45:09,Mippy,"Well, the point of a ""Tom pick "" is that Tom picks...Whatever he likes. Holy craoop...the legging!"
07-04-2018T18:45:10,DarthKeidran,"Possibilities thus far: Therie, Cathleen, Flora, Keith & New Basitins, Sea of Thieves, Control Collar."
07-04-2018T18:45:15,Dimensional,It's Daniels proposing to Therie

07-04-2018T18:46:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Yup, Rose. Confirmed."
07-04-2018T18:46:31,BadFoMo,...But Roes wasn't in this one.

07-04-2018T18:47:50,Dimensional,At least she had her ears. But does she have her tail?
07-04-2018T18:48:01,Bgrmystr2,we can hope
07-04-2018T18:48:03,ProsePro7,Is it Keith's mom?

07-04-2018T18:48:37,BadFoMo,"@Dadrobit It looks like it is her, but who says we can't have your's too?"
07-04-2018T18:48:39,WereKeidran,Cathleen Kaiser: Amazon Goddess

07-04-2018T18:50:51,CrRAR,it's for intimidation.
07-04-2018T18:50:53,DarthKeidran,Maybe one of the West Basitin's First leaders was a Tiger Basitin Hybrid.
07-04-2018T18:50:55,CrRAR,Are you intimidated yet?
07-04-2018T18:51:16,DarthKeidran,Maybe my next suggestion should be a Keidran/Basitin Hybrid.

07-04-2018T18:53:15,CrRAR,the REAL truth
07-04-2018T18:53:22,Dadrobit,Just that they were indulging in indecent Basitin fashion.
07-04-2018T18:53:25,ThingsAreMoving,unwrapping their ankles

07-04-2018T19:46:16,unsteddyphoenix,*[&gt;:T]
07-04-2018T19:46:20,Dadrobit,This is quite the day for basitins huh?
07-04-2018T19:46:25,DarthKeidran,@ThingsAreMoving  I was sitting up when you commented that and I just died laughing.
07-04-2018T19:46:29,Bgrmystr2,Basitin Sunday
07-04-2018T19:46:31,unsteddyphoenix,Well we all saw this coming
07-04-2018T19:46:33,MrEase,"Oh wow Tom's gonna go for over 3 characters, cool"
07-04-2018T19:46:36,MetalAppleSauce,Yes we've established this robit
07-04-2018T19:46:45,Dadrobit,Have we?
07-04-2018T19:46:53,unsteddyphoenix,"He's tactically blocking Natanis body, less to draw"
07-04-2018T19:46:55,MetalAppleSauce,April 8th shall now be known as Basitin Day
07-04-2018T19:47:00,Bgrmystr2,"several times earlier in the stream, dadro yeah"
07-04-2018T19:47:05,CrRAR,I dreamt lofty dreams
07-04-2018T19:47:10,Dadrobit,But the 8th won't always be a Sunday
07-04-2018T19:47:12,Xexanoth,it's only 4 of 7 so far....
07-04-2018T19:47:15,ProsePro7,Why is everyone impressed he's doing more than three?  What is this juggling?
07-04-2018T19:47:34,Dadrobit,Best do it as something like the second Sunday of April is Basitin Day
07-04-2018T19:47:37,DarthKeidran,"@MetalAppleSauce It has been Bookmarked, the Second Sunday of Every April: World Basitin Day!"
07-04-2018T19:47:50,Ordithus,Or perhaps the Sunday after Easter
07-04-2018T19:47:53,Bgrmystr2,"lol Prose, Tom doesn't usually do more than 3 or 4 characters in a sketch because it takes so long"
07-04-2018T19:48:08,MetalAppleSauce,"@Ordithus so yeah second sunday, since easter is always first sunday"
07-04-2018T19:48:24,Ordithus,"Not accurate, sometimes Easter is in March"
07-04-2018T19:48:32,Bgrmystr2,"if that right one is the one I'm thinking of, then she is STILL best girl"
07-04-2018T19:48:33,MetalAppleSauce,"And I meant legit April 8th, not just second sunday"
07-04-2018T19:48:48,DarthKeidran,"@ProsePro7 Characters are hard enough as it is, but when you have multiple, it makes it takes an annoyingly long time and is annoyingly complex."
07-04-2018T19:48:49,Dadrobit,Or else quality takes a nosedive (generally). Like in the strip poker Kat one where most people were just outlines.
07-04-2018T19:48:59,MuonNeutrino,"@MetalAppleSauce easter moves around, it's set relative to the lunar calendar and the spring solstice"
07-04-2018T19:49:00,MetalAppleSauce,"meaning if april fools was a monday, Basitin Day is on Easter"
07-04-2018T19:49:09,Elosan,Hello everyone!!

07-04-2018T20:04:31,Dadrobit,Adria? The mother who lives in a bar?
07-04-2018T20:04:43,ThingsAreMoving,Adria is the witch from Diablo series

07-04-2018T20:05:27,Dadrobit,I think the one who runs a county is probably a bit more accomplished.
07-04-2018T20:05:30,MetalAppleSauce,I judge a mother's mothership by their child
07-04-2018T20:05:37,MetalAppleSauce,"and frankly, Maeve &gt; Maddie"

07-04-2018T20:06:12,Dadrobit,And letting Maeve run into fireballs is any better?
07-04-2018T20:06:13,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta let your kids be independant
07-04-2018T20:06:14,FlightoFancy6058,Natani meets the Island Keidrians (Or Western Kedrians)
07-04-2018T20:06:17,MrEase,Thats a fair point

07-04-2018T20:06:48,MetalAppleSauce,@Dadrobit at least Adira's child was still within walking distance when they were lost
07-04-2018T20:06:54,Dadrobit,"Bgr, that's quite a reference game you've got going on."
07-04-2018T20:06:59,Vatruvius,Not that Maddie needs saving...
07-04-2018T20:07:11,Xexanoth,Adelaides child is a General at age 14
07-04-2018T20:07:14,Dadrobit,At least Adelaide's child is able to fend for herself
07-04-2018T20:07:15,Xexanoth,so
07-04-2018T20:07:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t Maddie her own force of nature?
07-04-2018T20:07:19,Bgrmystr2,"I stand by my original thoughts, the right one is best girl."
07-04-2018T20:07:27,ThingsAreMoving,Maddie is the force of chaos
07-04-2018T20:07:27,MetalAppleSauce,Yeah because that's what Basitins look for
07-04-2018T20:07:33,Vatruvius,Maddie is much older than Meave
07-04-2018T20:07:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a hurricane
07-04-2018T20:07:39,unsteddyphoenix,Protext your child from a fireball and shes safe for a day. Teach your child not to run into fireballs and shes safe her whole life.
07-04-2018T20:07:46,ThingsAreMoving,She's the chaos mask's anointed one
07-04-2018T20:07:47,CrRAR,lol

07-04-2018T20:08:04,ThingsAreMoving,Phoenix this is a win

07-04-2018T20:08:08,Bgrmystr2,"Phoenix, what if you teach your child to catch the fireball and throw it back?"
07-04-2018T20:08:21,MetalAppleSauce,Ok there Shi-Fu
07-04-2018T20:08:21,unsteddyphoenix,Youre a bad parent.
07-04-2018T20:08:26,Elosan,Though I think Adelaidie and Brienne of Tarth from Game of Thrones would be good friends XD
07-04-2018T20:08:27,CrRAR,"if fireballs run toward child, call Trace."
07-04-2018T20:08:28,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
07-04-2018T20:08:30,Ordithus,"Yes, Flight, Tom uses Photoshop"
07-04-2018T20:08:32,unsteddyphoenix,no defending that one
07-04-2018T20:08:38,Dadrobit,Better than Maeve going towards certain death because her mother couldn't instill basic anti-fireball knowledge.
07-04-2018T20:08:51,Bgrmystr2,Why is that bad? Someone throwin fireballs? Throw it back at em.
07-04-2018T20:08:57,Ordithus,"Kids need to know these things, y'know"
07-04-2018T20:09:00,Bgrmystr2,Why are they throwin fireballs in the first place
07-04-2018T20:09:01,unsteddyphoenix,Tbh why arent the teaching fireball defense in schools?
07-04-2018T20:09:01,CrRAR,serves em right!
07-04-2018T20:09:07,unsteddyphoenix,Its the education systems fault
07-04-2018T20:09:16,ThingsAreMoving,Give them a baseball bat and tell them to hit the fireball back
07-04-2018T20:09:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I lost count is this 5 or 6?
07-04-2018T20:09:20,Xexanoth,"it's called ""Dodgeball"" @unsteddy"
07-04-2018T20:09:20,Dadrobit,Be like Maddie and throw your superior officer at the fireball.
07-04-2018T20:09:25,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I guess, Things"
07-04-2018T20:09:32,Vatruvius,Anit-fireball knowledge is not common...that is a first in the town really. Otherwise everyone would know like the entire square full of people that Trace saved.
07-04-2018T20:09:37,MetalAppleSauce,"Maeve works with her mother in a fucking tavern, why would Adira have any reason to need protection?"
07-04-2018T20:09:46,MetalAppleSauce,Taverns tend to not be attacked
07-04-2018T20:09:46,CrRAR,So... call up Ness for fireball defense
07-04-2018T20:09:49,CrRAR,got it
07-04-2018T20:09:52,Elosan,I am so lost on the conversation about fireballs.
07-04-2018T20:09:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Offer the fireball a cup of water
07-04-2018T20:09:57,Bgrmystr2,@Xexanoth if you can dodge a wrench.. you can dodge a fireball :V

07-04-2018T20:10:12,unsteddyphoenix,Always prepare for the worst
07-04-2018T20:10:14,Dadrobit,And yet Maeve was not in the tavern was she?
07-04-2018T20:10:23,MetalAppleSauce,Because the templar were payed by a sexist foxwolf
07-04-2018T20:10:32,MetalAppleSauce,"thats why, phoenix"
07-04-2018T20:10:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Yup, that happened."

07-04-2018T20:11:02,Dadrobit,If only her mother was good enough to prepare her child for self defense like best mother Adelaide did.
07-04-2018T20:11:13,MetalAppleSauce,With what magic?
07-04-2018T20:11:16,unsteddyphoenix,Completely impossible that something bad would happen to a minority living in foreign land
07-04-2018T20:11:17,MetalAppleSauce,oh wait
07-04-2018T20:11:27,MuonNeutrino,this conversation is really getting silly =P
07-04-2018T20:11:28,ThingsAreMoving,Maeve tried to call off a fireball with her cuteness
07-04-2018T20:11:32,ThingsAreMoving,That didn't work

07-04-2018T20:12:02,MetalAppleSauce,"The fireball may be, but it's not immune to mages that want to protect said cuteness"

07-04-2018T20:54:26,DarthKeidran,All it would take is mary dying though because even now I don't think she really knows euchre much at all.
