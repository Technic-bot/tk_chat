13-01-2018T00:41:40,TheBeckoner,I'm not entirely sure this link will work but this is to a playlist Im compiling on spotify of the music Tom plays on stream. It isn't complete and it wont ever be as some of the songs he plays aren't on spotify best I can tell.
13-01-2018T00:41:44,TheBeckoner,https://open.spotify.com/user/thebeckoner/playlist/35fGQSXshEQbeJpOImk9ls
13-01-2018T02:50:41,ZizzoGaming,"@TheBeckoner I've actually been doing the same, however most of the music Tom plays during the streams is on YouTube"
13-01-2018T02:50:44,ZizzoGaming,https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2mxgzalMqxLgpu8abbpBuQDIa0A8KCSa
13-01-2018T06:33:22,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, thanks! I just usually find the ones on YouTube that I really like at the time and hit the like button so I can download them to the Walkman later, but this is nice to just have it all in one place."
13-01-2018T06:45:55,Bgrmystr2,"nice, Zizzo"
13-01-2018T09:11:25,TheBeckoner,Well color my playlist irrelevant lol
13-01-2018T09:43:54,TheBeckoner,Oh and nice job Zizzo
13-01-2018T14:05:36,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!
13-01-2018T14:06:45,TheBeckoner,Heyo Robit
13-01-2018T14:06:49,TheBeckoner,whats up?
13-01-2018T14:08:25,Dadrobit,"Just tryin to chill. Honestly a bit miffed at the moment. Got a ban warning on the TK because I stupidly, accidentally bypassed the swear filter when I called a troll out and told him he was on my ""shit-list""."
13-01-2018T14:08:40,Dadrobit,Turns out hyphenating stuff bypasses the filter.
13-01-2018T14:08:46,Dadrobit,whoops
13-01-2018T14:08:53,Dadrobit,tk forums*
13-01-2018T14:09:46,TheBeckoner,lol I feel like if the filter is that low quality that's their problem...
13-01-2018T14:10:05,TheBeckoner,but that sucks
13-01-2018T14:10:15,TheBeckoner,How many warning can you get?
13-01-2018T14:10:21,TheBeckoner,warnings*
13-01-2018T14:10:35,Dadrobit,"Meh, shit happens, I've blocked the douche responsible and I'l keep the hyphenation rule in mind for the future."
13-01-2018T14:10:58,Dadrobit,Dunno? I'll have to go back and see if it's in the rules.
13-01-2018T14:12:05,TheBeckoner,Hopefully it's something like 3 or so
13-01-2018T14:13:40,Dadrobit,"Hm, doesn't say anything in the rules. Just that racial slurs are insta-ban with no warning."
13-01-2018T14:14:03,Dadrobit,Probably just up to the discretion of the mods.
13-01-2018T14:14:27,TheBeckoner,Woa. And yeah you're probably right.
13-01-2018T14:14:42,TheBeckoner,I dont think Ive ever gotten banned on a forum before...
13-01-2018T14:15:01,TheBeckoner,"Plenty of video game servers, but never a forum"
13-01-2018T14:15:39,Dadrobit,"Ha, same. This guy knew how to push my buttons pretty damned well though. Commie bastard..."
13-01-2018T14:18:48,TheBeckoner,Lol. It'll always be the commies that get yah...
13-01-2018T14:20:26,TheBeckoner,Oh and I saw this last night and thought you may appreciate it. I personally love stuff like this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtfMQhd9Efs

13-01-2018T16:31:21,MviluUatusun,"Ah, a martini with a Kat instead of an olive.  I like this one better."
13-01-2018T16:31:25,DJSylveon,If this is going where I think it is then it will look like the logo of a resturant I go to on the other side of the state
13-01-2018T16:31:26,Dadrobit,"Sooooo, is there gonna be one large olive? Or just a bunch of em?"
13-01-2018T16:31:28,Vexd,"It'll get linked here, then you vote on the site"
13-01-2018T16:31:34,TheBeckoner,He usually draws second place or his pick after 1st

13-01-2018T16:32:05,unsteddyphoenix,I like how Tom veto'd that joke from that suggestion
13-01-2018T16:32:14,DJSylveon,I was listening to this song before the stream started xD
13-01-2018T16:32:14,WereKeidran,do you think this is why Kat was showering and lead to the Wet Kat sketch?

13-01-2018T20:05:51,Twokinds,Which they shed
13-01-2018T20:06:03,unsteddyphoenix,And humans make armour out of?
13-01-2018T20:06:05,Twokinds,The scales are used as money in some places.
13-01-2018T20:06:11,Xexanoth,lol
13-01-2018T20:06:18,TheFDdriver,really?
13-01-2018T20:06:21,FenceEqualizer,"If monster hunter is anything to go by, everything"
13-01-2018T20:06:28,Bgrmystr2,"but shedding for a dragon could be really beautiful process, unlike lizards :v"
13-01-2018T20:06:29,unsteddyphoenix,Always a rich akidrast to accept them
13-01-2018T20:06:29,BluePhantom90,or could be used as Armor if you got the right blacksmith
13-01-2018T20:06:30,Ordithus,Not many dragons in Mekkan
13-01-2018T20:06:42,Xexanoth,"that reminds me of the Warhammer40k orks, they use teeth as currency, one clan is the richest because their teeth regrow faster"
13-01-2018T20:07:12,unsteddyphoenix,Lol I love 40k orcs
13-01-2018T20:07:25,FenceEqualizer,I just imagine a dragon selling its scales for gold for there cave
13-01-2018T20:07:42,TheFDdriver,XD
13-01-2018T20:07:46,FenceEqualizer,Their
13-01-2018T20:07:46,BluePhantom90,I take you used a little off of the D&D books on the dragons. I have been writing a twokinds fan-fic where a dragon requested armor to be made of its scales
13-01-2018T20:07:56,Ordithus,40k greenskins are fungi... it's so weird
13-01-2018T20:08:04,Ordithus,warhammer in general I should say
13-01-2018T20:08:14,Xexanoth,weird but awesome
13-01-2018T20:08:14,BluePhantom90,the scales it shed
13-01-2018T20:08:21,Twokinds,Farmer consider it lucky to find a dragon sleeping in their fields. They can usually find a few disguarded scales.
13-01-2018T20:08:52,Ordithus,Also good for keeping would-be thieves away?
13-01-2018T20:08:55,Bgrmystr2,"@Xexanoth Just so you know, it was the same artist. So you're aware. :v"
13-01-2018T20:09:21,unsteddyphoenix,I guess it would cover the costs of missing livestock
13-01-2018T20:09:28,Twokinds,"Well, probably not. It's not like a dragon would know a tresspasser from a resident."
13-01-2018T20:09:29,Ordithus,"Oh yeah, that."
13-01-2018T20:09:30,TheFDdriver,good night everyone
13-01-2018T20:09:47,Xexanoth,yeah i know bgr ^^
13-01-2018T20:09:49,unsteddyphoenix,Is that how Nora met Trace?
13-01-2018T20:09:52,Twokinds,That or trampled crops.
13-01-2018T20:09:52,Bgrmystr2,mkay
13-01-2018T20:09:57,Ordithus,"Dragon sees sheep, noms"
13-01-2018T20:10:00,FenceEqualizer,"Hoowee, Laura! We got them there dragon in our fields, we gonna be rich!"
13-01-2018T20:10:03,unsteddyphoenix,Landed his farmer parents fields
13-01-2018T20:10:09,Bgrmystr2,lol maybe phoenix
13-01-2018T20:10:12,Twokinds,Heheh
13-01-2018T20:10:15,Bgrmystr2,asking the real questions
13-01-2018T20:10:21,Xexanoth,reminds me of the Dragons Burn comic: What does a dragon even need gold for? Dragon: Feminine products!
13-01-2018T20:10:33,BluePhantom90,But Nora is the only one that can shape-shift for now huh
13-01-2018T20:10:35,avaragejo,done or on break?
13-01-2018T20:10:39,Bgrmystr2,Done
13-01-2018T20:10:53,unsteddyphoenix,Traces parents are an interesting overlooked thing. How do they feel about trace now?
13-01-2018T20:11:43,ZRO4825,Do they even still exist? o.o;
13-01-2018T20:11:52,FenceEqualizer,Nah they ded
13-01-2018T20:11:56,Ordithus,They wouldn't be too old.
13-01-2018T20:12:02,Xexanoth,"i mean, trace isn't that old"
13-01-2018T20:12:06,BluePhantom90,"Lol I had a Sketch idea that Trace's Parents are Hippies. So they meet flora and they are cool with it. Emphasis on the ""cool"" part"
13-01-2018T20:12:26,InTheLionsDen,They tried to enter his estate when they weren't invited.
13-01-2018T20:12:26,BluePhantom90,high cool! lol
13-01-2018T20:14:00,BluePhantom90,Shocked no one did Flora's dad and sister meet Trace? Only Flora's mom
13-01-2018T20:14:48,unsteddyphoenix,Pretty sure theyre alive
13-01-2018T20:14:48,Ordithus,What if... Kat and Flora are sisters :ptv-wondering:
13-01-2018T20:15:01,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-floAAA:

13-01-2018T20:15:59,Xexanoth,time fore incest....er i mean look a squirrel
13-01-2018T20:16:00,Bgrmystr2,rofl the amount of I don't even know how people come to these conclusions
13-01-2018T20:16:29,Ordithus,Just a random non-serious thought
13-01-2018T20:16:39,BluePhantom90,If anyone wants to hear some other sketch ideas I got plenty I wont use.
13-01-2018T20:16:58,unsteddyphoenix,nope
13-01-2018T20:17:30,Ordithus,I give the chance of them actually being sisters at... nope.
13-01-2018T20:17:34,BadFoMo,@BluePhantom90 Why not?
13-01-2018T20:17:42,BluePhantom90,"Well I will name one for a joke. ""Reni request Kat to give her a massage"""
13-01-2018T20:17:52,BluePhantom90,Just imagine Kat has to work with
13-01-2018T20:17:59,Xexanoth,"the only sketch idea you need is: ""Maren and Raine helping Nibbly pick an accesoire"""
13-01-2018T20:18:21,BadFoMo,A what?
13-01-2018T20:18:34,BadFoMo,"Oh, nevermind."
13-01-2018T20:18:35,unsteddyphoenix,accessory
13-01-2018T20:18:36,Twokinds,Yo w0lf
13-01-2018T20:18:51,Xexanoth,i only forgot one s :/
13-01-2018T20:18:52,Ordithus,"For her wedding to Sythe, Xex?"
13-01-2018T20:19:03,unsteddyphoenix,The y was important
13-01-2018T20:19:04,Xexanoth,"nah, just in general"
13-01-2018T20:19:26,Xexanoth,"like, that's how she got her bow-thingy"
13-01-2018T20:19:44,BluePhantom90,What about Flora's baby shower. Everyone is getting drunk but Flora lol
13-01-2018T20:19:57,unsteddyphoenix,You actually cant stop yourself lol
13-01-2018T20:20:06,ZahnHolley,Im back toms done allready?
13-01-2018T20:20:10,Ordithus,Yes.

13-01-2018T20:21:03,ZahnHolley,Well uhhhhh. I.ll seeya all next time
13-01-2018T20:21:11,BadFoMo,Bye.
13-01-2018T20:21:21,Xexanoth,so we aren'T good enough for you Zahn?
13-01-2018T20:21:26,Ordithus,HiBye Zahn!
13-01-2018T20:22:14,ZahnHolley,I know nonoe likes me anyway xexanoth.
13-01-2018T20:22:15,BluePhantom90,"So Tom, Reni is like a baby compared to Nora, thus is why Reni doesn't have the same magic abilities as Nora"
13-01-2018T20:22:58,BadFoMo,How about this as a request? 82.	Kathrin goes crazy with the ‘Magic Pen’ and gives Trace and Eric tails!
13-01-2018T20:23:09,Xexanoth,but...i like everyone :ptv-uneasy:
13-01-2018T20:23:31,Xexanoth,you have 82 request? O.o
13-01-2018T20:24:06,BluePhantom90,King Adelaide with Spartan II enhancements. Able to bench press a mountain.
13-01-2018T20:24:16,BluePhantom90,lol Halo joke there
13-01-2018T20:24:17,BadFoMo,More like 83 entrys.
13-01-2018T20:24:26,Xexanoth,wouldn't that be a downgrade :ptv-laugh:
13-01-2018T20:24:54,Xexanoth,"geez, i have maybe 5 decent ideas for sketches...then again i'm broke so it doesn't matter"
13-01-2018T20:26:00,BluePhantom90,"Nope The king having her bones reinforced with, muscles enhanced, and she would be able to see in the dark and time would move slower for her when in combat."
13-01-2018T20:26:40,BluePhantom90,The Spartan II's were able to break military grade armor and lift Tanks. Just imagine the King getting that
13-01-2018T20:27:07,BluePhantom90,She would be unstoppable. Hell swords or magic might not be effective against her
13-01-2018T20:27:41,Xexanoth,so...no different then now? :ptv-dealwithit:
13-01-2018T20:28:27,Xexanoth,*than
13-01-2018T20:28:34,BluePhantom90,hmm No magic could cause her harm.
13-01-2018T20:28:39,BluePhantom90,before
13-01-2018T20:29:00,Xexanoth,i don't see how cybernetics would protect against magic.
13-01-2018T20:29:47,Bgrmystr2,it depends
13-01-2018T20:29:59,Xexanoth,"i mean, the magic in the story basicially just messed her up like a disease, titanium bones and shit doesn't help against that"
13-01-2018T20:30:02,Bgrmystr2,"magic can either be a physical force, like an element or something"
13-01-2018T20:30:17,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah, magic like auras and stuff"
13-01-2018T20:30:22,Bgrmystr2,"just being there, it's in the air"
13-01-2018T20:30:36,Bgrmystr2,"it depends on if the air has to be inside the suit for it to be effective, like"
13-01-2018T20:30:44,Bgrmystr2,a full spartan armor can be completely sealed.
13-01-2018T20:30:53,Bgrmystr2,cuz space.
13-01-2018T20:31:12,BluePhantom90,"She could punch the magic like ""One-punch man"" with the Spartan II enhancements lol"
13-01-2018T20:31:16,Xexanoth,"i mean, if it's just some lifedrain that just saps your energy armor won't really have an effect"
13-01-2018T20:31:40,Bgrmystr2,"if it's air particles, then it would be ineffective against a suit like that, but magic isn't like.. a physical thing"
13-01-2018T20:31:47,Bgrmystr2,it transends material
13-01-2018T20:31:50,BluePhantom90,lol There we go another sketch idea lol
13-01-2018T20:32:39,Bgrmystr2,the suits wouldn't really protect against anything that isn't effectively part of the physics of the world
13-01-2018T20:33:15,Bgrmystr2,enhancements may turn the king into the hulk though :P
13-01-2018T20:33:16,BluePhantom90,"I said enhancements, not the suit"
13-01-2018T20:33:28,Xexanoth,neither would the enhancements
13-01-2018T20:34:06,Bgrmystr2,you're right Xex
13-01-2018T20:34:17,Bgrmystr2,it's all based in the physics of the world
13-01-2018T20:34:42,Bgrmystr2,"but it wouldn't be surprising to have that kind of tech improved with magic, if it were to exist"
13-01-2018T20:35:17,BluePhantom90,"lol Fine how about New Sketch idea ""King Adelaide as one punch-man"""
13-01-2018T20:35:26,Xexanoth,*woman :P
13-01-2018T20:35:44,Xexanoth,also i would totaly vote for that ^^
13-01-2018T20:35:58,BluePhantom90,lol Well Its out there for who ever wants to use it
13-01-2018T20:36:10,Xexanoth,then we need Maddie as Genos
13-01-2018T20:36:17,w0lfmare,"Hey Tom. Sorry, distracted XD"
13-01-2018T20:36:20,Bgrmystr2,"I can't suggest, so don't look at me :C"
13-01-2018T20:36:26,Bgrmystr2,suddenly w0lf :D
13-01-2018T20:36:32,Ordithus,Heyo w0lf
13-01-2018T20:36:57,Ordithus,Zen can be Mugen Rider (or whatever the bicycle guy was)
13-01-2018T20:37:00,Twokinds,Just realized I have one random hair on my head that's way longer than all the others.
13-01-2018T20:37:01,w0lfmare,Hello hello
13-01-2018T20:37:16,Ordithus,Get a haircut
13-01-2018T20:37:28,Xexanoth,..i tend to find hairs like that in my beard...it's annoying
13-01-2018T20:37:29,w0lfmare,A hair cut
13-01-2018T20:37:33,BluePhantom90,BTW Tom here is something funny someone found https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/381592543734792193/401750917440864257/tumblr_nm287t9WqH1slox44o1_500.png
13-01-2018T20:37:35,unsteddyphoenix,Ahoge? :thinking:
13-01-2018T20:38:01,Bgrmystr2,"the question is, does it stick up"
13-01-2018T20:38:04,Bgrmystr2,by itself
13-01-2018T20:38:09,Bgrmystr2,"or at least, Can it?"
13-01-2018T20:39:05,BluePhantom90,video game character looks oddly familiar huh
13-01-2018T20:39:37,Twokinds,"Uh, not it does not"
13-01-2018T20:39:46,Twokinds,"And I doubt it could, or it'd hit the ceiling xD"
13-01-2018T20:40:00,Bgrmystr2,Not ahoge confirmed.:ptv-sad:
13-01-2018T20:40:01,BluePhantom90,lol
13-01-2018T20:40:16,Bgrmystr2,sad day
13-01-2018T20:40:21,Bgrmystr2,maybe next time haha
13-01-2018T20:40:22,unsteddyphoenix,Uh
13-01-2018T20:40:26,Ordithus,"So... three possiblities.  Tom is really tall, that hair is really long, or Tom lives in a hobbit hole."
13-01-2018T20:40:30,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...pretty long
13-01-2018T20:40:38,Bgrmystr2,that it is yeah
13-01-2018T20:40:41,Xexanoth,so tom can't be controlled via his hair...
13-01-2018T20:40:48,unsteddyphoenix,How long is your hair now? :thinking:
13-01-2018T20:40:50,Bgrmystr2,we don't know that xex
13-01-2018T20:41:00,Bgrmystr2,he would need a second strand of hair about as long
13-01-2018T20:41:04,Bgrmystr2,to try and control
13-01-2018T20:41:19,Bgrmystr2,remember you need two strands of hair for full control.
13-01-2018T20:41:21,BluePhantom90,lol Maybe tom could go Super Sayin... need someone to check Tom's Power level
13-01-2018T20:41:38,Twokinds,My hair goes to the bottom of my shoulderblades.
13-01-2018T20:41:50,Bgrmystr2,that's not bad
13-01-2018T20:41:56,Bgrmystr2,long-ish
13-01-2018T20:42:10,BluePhantom90,eh that is too long for me. I like my hair military cut.
13-01-2018T20:42:26,unsteddyphoenix,Thas cool~
13-01-2018T20:42:32,Twokinds,But the one hair was down to my tailbone. Almost twice as long.
13-01-2018T20:42:43,Xexanoth,"long hair is nice, but it's annoying to wash/dry"
13-01-2018T20:42:45,Ordithus,That is really weird
13-01-2018T20:42:48,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: holy crap
13-01-2018T20:42:51,unsteddyphoenix,The chosen hair
13-01-2018T20:42:54,Bgrmystr2,ikr
13-01-2018T20:42:57,unsteddyphoenix,Avoided every cutting experience
13-01-2018T20:43:05,Bgrmystr2,never cut it
13-01-2018T20:43:07,unsteddyphoenix,If I could get away with hair that long I might
13-01-2018T20:43:07,Bgrmystr2,could be bad luck
13-01-2018T20:43:13,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true!
13-01-2018T20:43:15,Twokinds,Probably just a freakish random fast grower
13-01-2018T20:43:18,unsteddyphoenix,Who knows WHAT could happen
13-01-2018T20:43:20,BluePhantom90,Tom must have been a hippie for a bit
13-01-2018T20:43:24,unsteddyphoenix,Cant take that risk
13-01-2018T20:43:36,Xexanoth,it grows into a clone
13-01-2018T20:43:40,Ordithus,It was folded 1000 times
13-01-2018T20:43:42,Xexanoth,an EVIL clone
13-01-2018T20:43:45,Bgrmystr2,ahha ord xD
13-01-2018T20:43:46,Ordithus,Can you cut things with it?
13-01-2018T20:43:56,Twokinds,Can't be
13-01-2018T20:44:02,Twokinds,I already have a goatee
13-01-2018T20:44:17,Xexanoth,then your evil version DOESN'T have the goatee
13-01-2018T20:44:17,Bgrmystr2,Tom is the evil twin! :ptv-shock:
13-01-2018T20:44:33,Ordithus,"This has been known for at least 6 months, guys"
13-01-2018T20:44:38,unsteddyphoenix,I see CERTAIN emotes he's made and I believe it
13-01-2018T20:44:39,Bgrmystr2,haha true
13-01-2018T20:44:58,w0lfmare,Tom is his evil version
13-01-2018T20:45:16,Bgrmystr2,so who's the good version..? :ptv-wondering:
13-01-2018T20:45:24,unsteddyphoenix,Hes in the basement
13-01-2018T20:45:25,Xexanoth,buried in the backyard
13-01-2018T20:45:29,unsteddyphoenix,Ayy
13-01-2018T20:45:39,Bgrmystr2,is.. the basement buried in the backyard?
13-01-2018T20:45:52,Xexanoth,yes....
13-01-2018T20:46:01,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-katx_x:
13-01-2018T20:46:08,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
13-01-2018T20:46:10,Bgrmystr2,Well then
13-01-2018T20:46:23,unsteddyphoenix,We all what I was talking about damnit
13-01-2018T20:46:49,BluePhantom90,-sighs- r-r really wish you would do Commissions Tom. have like three characters I would pay handsomely for you to draw.
13-01-2018T20:47:23,Xexanoth,"man, can you imagine the chaos if Tom makes a dead raine emote :ptv-laugh:"

13-01-2018T20:49:01,BluePhantom90,Well I am not sure if i would go to the Comic Con in California. With that Hepatitis crap going on over there.
13-01-2018T20:49:04,Ordithus,"Tom, I just realized.  You could be like Samson.  Your hair is your power, don't cut it!"
13-01-2018T20:49:09,Xexanoth,"nah, would be more"
13-01-2018T20:49:35,Xexanoth,"i mean, there would be one full on crazy person sure but it's like like other people aren't raine fans"
13-01-2018T20:49:46,Xexanoth,*it's not
13-01-2018T20:50:37,BluePhantom90,My bad hepatitis A. Which is transferable by touch.
13-01-2018T20:50:57,Dadrobit,"Howdy y'all, back from the party!"
13-01-2018T20:51:04,Ordithus,Heya robit!
13-01-2018T20:51:33,unsteddyphoenix,Yo daddy
13-01-2018T20:52:02,BluePhantom90,hey. Talking about how I might not go to California because of the Hepatitis A outbreak there. Cause I would be too damn scared to shake hands or let anyone handle my food
13-01-2018T20:52:35,BluePhantom90,What do you think Tom?
13-01-2018T20:54:26,BluePhantom90,I was going to put my money on the Convention that is in Cincinnati in a couple of months
13-01-2018T20:54:40,Dadrobit,Had a pretty funny moment. One of my nephews is suuuuuuuuuuuper into Harry Potter. He opened up one of his presents and had this super high pitched squee of delight that turned into a moan of despair in the same breath as he discovered what he thought was
13-01-2018T20:55:03,BluePhantom90,lol
13-01-2018T20:55:05,Dadrobit,A Griffondor scarf turned out to be an Arizona State University winter cap
13-01-2018T20:55:15,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: fucking RIP
13-01-2018T20:55:18,Dadrobit,(They share the same color)

13-01-2018T20:55:39,Bgrmystr2,I know that feel
13-01-2018T20:55:49,Dadrobit,"He still likes it though, he's a huge ASU fan anyways."

13-01-2018T20:57:17,Bgrmystr2,"A wizard somewhere else in the world : ""Wait, if we got the this scarf.. then what did the muggle get?"""
13-01-2018T20:58:04,Bgrmystr2,damn magic shipping companies always switching boxes :P

13-01-2018T21:01:51,Twokinds,"I'd love to, but I haven't bought a table"
13-01-2018T21:01:51,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-flomad: mmmmmmm
13-01-2018T21:01:55,BluePhantom90,it is a small convention.
13-01-2018T21:02:53,BluePhantom90,Still have time Tom. I mean I haven't seen any big star's or artist going to it
13-01-2018T21:05:17,BluePhantom90,"r-r plus I Mifune, Neon, and Zro would want me to get them commission from you if you do go"
13-01-2018T21:06:31,Twokinds,"Man, if only I could just have a convention that didn't require me to go anywhere"
13-01-2018T21:06:55,unsteddyphoenix,Own-house convention? Not sure you want that either...
13-01-2018T21:07:16,Xexanoth,"online convention, so you don't even have to meet people"
13-01-2018T21:08:02,Dadrobit,"Sooooo, just the online store he already has?"
13-01-2018T21:08:05,Twokinds,That sounds good
13-01-2018T21:08:07,BluePhantom90,lol You really want Stalkers into your house Tom lol. You could do regular commissions
13-01-2018T21:08:08,unsteddyphoenix,Hey thats not bad lol

13-01-2018T21:08:40,unsteddyphoenix,How much is a virtual ticket to virtual cinicinnati
13-01-2018T21:08:56,Twokinds,Nothing! Even better
13-01-2018T21:08:57,Dadrobit,If it's measured in bitcoins I'm out
13-01-2018T21:09:07,BluePhantom90,lol well still sad for me I couldn't make it because My computer wouldn't handle any online 2nd life conventions
13-01-2018T21:09:09,unsteddyphoenix,Thats just within my price range! Im in! :D
13-01-2018T21:09:10,Dadrobit,\o/
13-01-2018T21:12:05,BluePhantom90,I couldn't even get on. I mean I tried Star citizen and its like lag crazy for me. I really need a new laptop or something
13-01-2018T21:13:14,Combak,Hey all.
13-01-2018T21:13:26,Combak,Seems like I missed the end. Oh well.
13-01-2018T21:13:51,BluePhantom90,yep
13-01-2018T21:14:03,Dadrobit,"Hm, virtual con means virtual signatures. Does that mean a signature book would be filled with just be a bunch of checkmarks?"
13-01-2018T21:14:20,Dadrobit,"Whoa, my English shit the bed there"
13-01-2018T21:14:27,TheDixieNutjob,*whistles into the chat*
13-01-2018T21:14:49,Dadrobit,o/ Combak and Dixie
13-01-2018T21:15:19,unsteddyphoenix,"It's filled with those ""are you a robot"" tests"
13-01-2018T21:15:36,Dadrobit,Just a bunch of captchas.
13-01-2018T21:16:15,unsteddyphoenix,I guess this convention would be pretty...unconventional
13-01-2018T21:16:16,TheDixieNutjob,heh heh heeehhhh they'll never discover the fact that I am in fact a terminator
13-01-2018T21:16:21,unsteddyphoenix,:ptv-dealwithit:
13-01-2018T21:17:01,Dadrobit,*City Skyline*
13-01-2018T21:20:19,Dadrobit,Dunno if I'm gonna go to the next PHX Comicon. Might let it cool down for a year.
13-01-2018T21:20:34,Dadrobit,I think they might still have their weapons ban in place
13-01-2018T21:20:48,Dadrobit,Hurt a lot of cosplay and cosplay related panels
13-01-2018T21:23:07,TheDixieNutjob,"wait, did I miss the stream?"
13-01-2018T21:23:14,BluePhantom90,I mean Tom's a germaphobe. And California having that outbreak there I wouldn't want to go myself. and I have family in California
13-01-2018T21:23:16,BluePhantom90,yeah
13-01-2018T21:23:21,TheDixieNutjob,D'oh!
13-01-2018T21:23:25,Bgrmystr2,"yeah Dixie, the time is at the top of the chat."
13-01-2018T21:23:30,Bgrmystr2,Sundays are 4pm Eastern
13-01-2018T21:23:52,TheDixieNutjob,"yeah, I misread it thinking each day was at 9pm"
13-01-2018T21:24:07,TheDixieNutjob,silly me
13-01-2018T21:24:14,Bgrmystr2,now you know
13-01-2018T21:27:47,Dadrobit,"Hm, seems like they rolled back a lot on the weapon restrictions. Still no replica firearms of any kind, replica explosives of any kind, and no edged weapons depending on their material (lightweight materials only, no real edges)."
13-01-2018T21:29:26,unsteddyphoenix,No REPLICA firearms? that sucks
13-01-2018T21:31:00,Ordithus,I returneth
13-01-2018T21:31:02,BluePhantom90,I would be Shocked if Tom go's to California. I mean I can see Tom wearing Gloves or Full hazmat suite there lol
13-01-2018T21:31:55,Dadrobit,"We had a gunman attempt an assassination/mass shooting last year, but luckily he was arrested while he was still scoping the place out before anyone was killed, so they came down super hard on weapon bans for the remainder of the convention last year."
13-01-2018T21:32:12,Dadrobit,Nothing was allowed period.
13-01-2018T21:32:44,unsteddyphoenix,really now
13-01-2018T21:32:49,unsteddyphoenix,didnt know that
13-01-2018T21:32:55,unsteddyphoenix,i wonder many attempts get stopped
13-01-2018T21:32:59,Dadrobit,It was super bad timing because we had just suffered an successful shooting elsewhere in the country just days prior.
13-01-2018T21:33:29,unsteddyphoenix,These shooters need to get together and sort the schedules out
13-01-2018T21:33:50,Dadrobit,"I didn't mean for the shooters, I meant for the con-goers..."
13-01-2018T21:34:31,Dadrobit,"But yeah, I was there and I didn't hear about it until hours later while I was still at the con. They kept it pretty well under wraps."
13-01-2018T21:34:34,unsteddyphoenix,Man people put INSANE detail into their cosplays now
13-01-2018T21:34:37,unsteddyphoenix,that sucks :/
13-01-2018T21:35:05,Dadrobit,"Indeed, there were a LOT of unhappy people."
13-01-2018T21:35:36,Ordithus,"For those worried about the hep A breakout, there is a vaccine, and it is super effective."
13-01-2018T21:36:31,Dadrobit,One large vendor ended up having to be removed because they made such a stink about it. They wet around with thousands of flyers tacking them everywhere defaming the convention for it.
13-01-2018T21:36:36,Dadrobit,went*
13-01-2018T21:37:44,Dadrobit,They sold custom lightsabers at a super high premium and didn't like that they had to wrap them in plastic bags before handing them to the customers.
13-01-2018T21:38:03,Dadrobit,It was a bit of a shit show
13-01-2018T21:38:25,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
13-01-2018T21:38:29,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh beurocracy
13-01-2018T21:40:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, evidently they even tried getting into it with police because of it. Hot tip: Don't fuck with the police while they're on high alert after just stopping a mass shooting!"
13-01-2018T21:41:28,ZizzoGaming,"The Denver Comic Con is pretty nice, although most people (such as Tom and Mark) don't pay it much attention"
13-01-2018T21:42:27,Bgrmystr2,replica weapons are inspected before they get into the con. Not allowing them into the con won't stop someone from getting into the place with a real one
13-01-2018T21:42:33,Bgrmystr2,people think that stops people like them
13-01-2018T21:42:35,Bgrmystr2,it won't.
13-01-2018T21:42:37,Bgrmystr2,never does.
13-01-2018T21:42:47,Bgrmystr2,and the con-goers lose out
13-01-2018T21:42:59,Bgrmystr2,"granted they lose no matter what happens, but yknow"
13-01-2018T21:43:08,Bgrmystr2,sad to see
13-01-2018T21:44:02,Ordithus,"One weird security situation is the big EAA airshow in Oshkosh, WI every year."
13-01-2018T21:44:08,Dadrobit,Metal detectors and police sniffing dogs will at least act as a deterrent.
13-01-2018T21:44:15,Ordithus,"They check people coming in at the gates, but a ton of people fly in."
13-01-2018T21:44:21,Twokinds,I wouldn't be opposed to going to Denver.
13-01-2018T21:44:28,Ordithus,They aren't checked.  Someone could bring all sorts of things that way...
13-01-2018T21:45:49,Ordithus,Like Kinder Eggs.  Oh the humanity.
13-01-2018T21:46:01,Dadrobit,chokes
13-01-2018T21:46:17,Ordithus,heimlichs
13-01-2018T21:47:01,BluePhantom90,"huh but the only time I can go to a convention where you are tom is either here in Ohio, or California. r-r money has gotten tight"
13-01-2018T21:47:39,Dadrobit,"But yeah, PHX is huge and usually goes off without a hitch. But you know, one bad apple, (read:gunman) ruins the whole bushel for a year."
13-01-2018T21:47:48,Bgrmystr2,if not longer
13-01-2018T21:48:08,Dadrobit,Indeed.
13-01-2018T21:48:23,LeKnightWolf,that really sucks
13-01-2018T21:48:27,ZizzoGaming,"@Twokinds you should go to the Denver Comic Con, if not hold a panel, just to see it. Denver is a really nice place"
13-01-2018T21:49:20,Dadrobit,It really sucks especially bad because what ended up happening was the best case scenario. No one other than the asshole got hurt!
13-01-2018T21:50:17,Dadrobit,There were a lot of sad Deadpools with empty holsters and sheathes the next few days.
13-01-2018T21:50:54,Bgrmystr2,"yup, congoers lose"
13-01-2018T21:50:58,Bgrmystr2,sad day
13-01-2018T21:51:10,Dadrobit,People did what they could still https://i.redd.it/qj42iwzq360z.jpg
13-01-2018T21:51:38,unsteddyphoenix,Lol thats the saddest picture
13-01-2018T21:51:40,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
13-01-2018T21:51:43,ZizzoGaming,Haha
13-01-2018T21:51:46,Bgrmystr2,damn
13-01-2018T21:51:55,Dadrobit,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d6091280973338c4358423db021783c62a847a6/c=173-0-2828-1996&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/05/30/Phoenix/Phoenix/636317519959128704-05272017-Phoenix-Comicon-18.jpg
13-01-2018T21:51:56,Bgrmystr2,"see, that's the kinda shit that makes me not want to go to a convention like that"
13-01-2018T21:51:57,Ordithus,Pew pew
13-01-2018T21:52:12,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's just fucking sad
13-01-2018T21:53:52,Dadrobit,Well at least lightsabers and pulse rifles will be back for next time.
13-01-2018T21:54:58,ZizzoGaming,mumbles something about the Denver Comic Con
13-01-2018T21:58:11,BluePhantom90,wait they took his Lightsaber!!! REALLY its not a gun!
13-01-2018T21:59:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, they went whole hog on the ban last year. Nothing was allowed. And anything purchased had to be bagged and was encouraged to be put in your hotel room/car ASAP"
13-01-2018T22:02:32,Bgrmystr2,overzealous and ridiculous overprotection like that can kill a con
13-01-2018T22:03:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, well over 100,000 attendees last time, we'll see how much it's been impacted."
13-01-2018T22:03:57,Bgrmystr2,"if it was a permanant change, it would drop"
13-01-2018T22:04:05,Bgrmystr2,but it seems like it may not be perm
13-01-2018T22:06:30,Dadrobit,"Yea, I think going forward it sounds like they're just focusing on props that are real-world firearm replicas. Fantasy firearms are okay as far as I can tell."
13-01-2018T22:07:55,Dadrobit,"Oh, and they've re-branded too. San Diego trademarked Comic con so that they're the only one able to use it. Now it's Phoenix Comic Fest."
13-01-2018T22:09:13,Bgrmystr2,"Comic con is too general. it's literally ""Comic Convention"" as a general term. How the hell did they manage to trademark it?"
13-01-2018T22:09:29,Bgrmystr2,"that's like a company tradmarking the word ""cup"""
13-01-2018T22:09:37,Bgrmystr2,"or ""car"""
13-01-2018T22:09:41,Bgrmystr2,or something like that lol
13-01-2018T22:11:56,Dadrobit,"Because they first coined it 48-ish years ago and Phoenix has only used it for 16. They filed a 12 million dollar lawsuit against Salt Lake City for using it and won. But luckily they only had to pay $20,000."
13-01-2018T22:12:37,Dadrobit,So now pretty much every other con out there is re-branding to keep away.
13-01-2018T22:13:44,Bgrmystr2,wow. That's kinda sad they can trademark something that's so vague noone can even call their comic convention a comic convention
13-01-2018T22:13:46,Bgrmystr2,-_-
13-01-2018T22:13:51,Bgrmystr2,our system is totally fucked
13-01-2018T22:16:10,Dadrobit,"As I read up on this, the Salt Lake case has been going on for about 3 years now and they only just recently came to that verdict."
13-01-2018T22:18:22,Dadrobit,Evidently they are attempting an appeal and trying to get the trademark removed from solely belonging to San Diego.
13-01-2018T22:18:55,ZizzoGaming,"From my understanding of what I just read, San Diego trademarked the term ""Comic-Con"" with the hyphen, and the trade mark only applies to ""Comic-Con"" with the hyphen"
13-01-2018T22:20:55,Bgrmystr2,"ahh, then another convention could make one without the hyphen? Though theoretically, San Diego could then sue for being so similar that people would ""get confused"""
13-01-2018T22:21:13,Bgrmystr2,not that it matters considering the term literally means the same thing.
13-01-2018T22:21:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, read that too, evidentally just being too close to something that is already hyper generic is still protected...."
13-01-2018T22:21:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah
13-01-2018T22:22:00,Dadrobit,Because SDCC and SLCC are too close.
13-01-2018T22:22:21,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, if I were another convention using the ""Comic Con"" without the hyphen, I would challenge that to a higher court on the fact that the term is too broad"
13-01-2018T22:22:40,Bgrmystr2,and shouldn't be trademarkable to begin with
13-01-2018T22:30:01,Dadrobit,"Like I said, they've filed a petition with the USPTO for removing the trademark, but unfortunately it's fresh enough that no other news has come out. Here's hoping it gets removed."
13-01-2018T22:34:48,Bgrmystr2,yeh. ;/
13-01-2018T23:19:38,BluePhantom90,So just the few and Proud fans that still remain lol
13-01-2018T23:34:41,KuroganeWatanoshi,Darnit! The stream wouldn't load. I missed every part of it
13-01-2018T23:35:09,BluePhantom90,"yeah I missed some of it too, you can always rewatch it"
13-01-2018T23:35:35,Bgrmystr2,yeh it's in the recording
