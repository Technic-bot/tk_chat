02-07-2018T00:46:48,TheGamePlayer,"So I've been thing if zombies are attracted to noise then why don't people drop loud speakers hooked up to music with solar panels and lots of batteries, that should last a bit right?"
02-07-2018T00:47:02,TheGamePlayer,*thinking
02-07-2018T00:56:36,unsteddyphoenix,loudspeakers have been used a lot in zombie stuff already
02-07-2018T00:56:50,unsteddyphoenix,attract zombies so they can move around
02-07-2018T00:56:54,unsteddyphoenix,I think that was in the walking dead
02-07-2018T00:58:49,TheGamePlayer,"I'd put it in the middle of a city and get an amplifier like in the beginning of but to the future, crank it up all the way any blast music that way I can enjoy the noise well attracting the zambies away"

02-07-2018T01:36:20,Bgrmystr2,Well. That was a fun bday
02-07-2018T01:39:04,Bgrmystr2,"got myself $110, gonna hopefully get a good microphone to throw it at."
02-07-2018T01:39:44,Bgrmystr2,it'll go nicely with the $100 I already have

02-07-2018T01:51:31,TheGamePlayer,Again happy late bday
02-07-2018T01:52:52,TheGamePlayer,I can't sleep drank to much coffee
02-07-2018T01:53:23,Bgrmystr2,"lolthanks, hope to get everything I need for recording, but will need to start simple"
02-07-2018T01:54:49,TheGamePlayer,Cool
02-07-2018T01:55:24,TheGamePlayer,I need an apple devices so I can get garage band and make more music
02-07-2018T01:56:38,Bgrmystr2,why would you want apple when there's so much better and higher quality technology available for cheaper prices?
02-07-2018T01:59:08,TheGamePlayer,Because garageband  is a simple music creator that I like to use and I don't have to pay for it because I've got the premium for it already and if I get a apple devices I'll be able to get all of my stuff back from my broken one
02-07-2018T01:59:32,Bgrmystr2,hmm
02-07-2018T01:59:56,TheGamePlayer,And I prefer apple it's simple and I like it
02-07-2018T02:00:36,Bgrmystr2,"xD Well I dunno what apple you're using that's simple, but you do you. :)"
02-07-2018T02:01:00,TheGamePlayer,I've got an iPod I could use but it's not up to date it's a 4gen I think
02-07-2018T02:01:37,TheGamePlayer,Well to me it's simple cause it's all I've used really till now
02-07-2018T02:03:57,TheGamePlayer,NVM it's  incompatible with the 4gen now
02-07-2018T02:05:11,TheGamePlayer,Requires IOS 11.4 or later... Only got iOS 6.1.6

02-07-2018T14:29:56,BadFoMo,Hmm?
02-07-2018T14:30:13,BadFoMo,"Oh, payday."
02-07-2018T14:39:28,Xexanoth,i thought i was because Adira Daki is out today.
02-07-2018T14:51:13,Dadrobit,Some third party printers might see the Adria Daki as payday.
02-07-2018T14:52:56,Xexanoth,"there's only one sultion to that, TOm needs to sell it himself :ptv-laugh:"
02-07-2018T14:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Gonna get that monz
02-07-2018T14:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m getting that lunch with ma sister
02-07-2018T15:00:49,Bgrmystr2,won't be easy to print those kind of pillows though
02-07-2018T15:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like a soft squishy pillow
02-07-2018T15:02:11,Xexanoth,pfff ever heard of 3d Printing :ptv-snicker:
02-07-2018T15:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Complete with artificial chest floof
02-07-2018T15:03:09,Bgrmystr2,yeah gl with that
02-07-2018T15:12:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Might stick with smothering my cats with love
02-07-2018T15:15:00,NightMeaty22,Well... i'm back for a day
02-07-2018T15:19:51,Xexanoth,you shouldn't smother your cats with anyhting
02-07-2018T15:29:19,Dadrobit,A quick Bing search popped up a custom Furry Daki site offering 50x15 (roughly 20''x6') cases for $50 a print.
02-07-2018T15:29:36,Dadrobit,"So, there ya go."
02-07-2018T15:29:55,Dadrobit,EZPZ Adria Daki.

02-07-2018T15:43:24,Xexanoth,"we have breast mousepads, you really surprised about breast dakis?"
02-07-2018T15:43:36,Bgrmystr2,"that was a subject of many stream conversations, dadro"
02-07-2018T15:43:48,Bgrmystr2,have you really never been in a single one?
02-07-2018T15:44:38,Bgrmystr2,"and the site prolly uses peach skin, which is why they offer it so cheap"
02-07-2018T15:44:44,Dadrobit,"Nope, I'm totally new, just found out Mark's brother does cmics!"
02-07-2018T15:44:49,Dadrobit,comics*
02-07-2018T15:44:56,Bgrmystr2,"whaat, he does?"
02-07-2018T15:45:00,Bgrmystr2,huh
02-07-2018T15:45:01,Bgrmystr2,;v
02-07-2018T15:56:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I just blew Bagheera’s mind
02-07-2018T15:56:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And all I did was put ice in his water bowl
02-07-2018T15:58:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Why not just stuff two mini pillows in for boobs
02-07-2018T15:59:31,Xexanoth,wouldn'T they just move around?
02-07-2018T16:01:19,FenceEqualizer,Dakis are so strange. Wonder if people have them out in the open or if they hide them in the attic when they have company
02-07-2018T16:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You can put in a little stitch to hold them where they need to be
02-07-2018T16:07:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"And as for the secrecy thing, the only reason I’ve found that they’re hidden is the owner does more than hug them"
02-07-2018T16:07:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Or they’re embarrassed of their friends’ possible opinions
02-07-2018T16:14:57,Xexanoth,i guess it also depends on how NSFW they are
02-07-2018T16:15:13,Bgrmystr2,wouldn't bother me or my friends
02-07-2018T16:15:20,Xexanoth,people generally don't like having nude stuff out in the open
02-07-2018T16:15:24,Bgrmystr2,might bother the couple I live with though
02-07-2018T16:20:24,BadFoMo,"What if you had more that one Daki, but it was to do something like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5d8pVg3Qtg&"
02-07-2018T16:29:05,FenceEqualizer,Have dakis everywhere while having two reenacting the titanic scene in the pool?
02-07-2018T16:29:42,FenceEqualizer,Because to be fair. I would be impress they had the time and resources to pull that off
02-07-2018T16:34:40,Dadrobit,I was waiting for a giant duck daki
02-07-2018T16:35:44,Bgrmystr2,that video was amazing even without a duck daki
02-07-2018T16:44:24,BadFoMo,...Sketch Request: Maddie posses all the Dakis around the manson?
02-07-2018T16:44:45,Xexanoth,only if she makes a tea party with em
02-07-2018T16:45:17,Xexanoth,"shit, now i really want that sketch"
02-07-2018T16:45:26,Xexanoth,*curse you my inability to draw*
02-07-2018T16:59:48,Dadrobit,We already had a tea party Maddie with Trace as a Chipendale and Keith in a Maid Outfit though.
02-07-2018T17:00:52,Dadrobit,"https://www.patreon.com/posts/truth-or-madness-13565216 Ah, there was more than tea, lots of cake and a Nibbs in Maid as well."
02-07-2018T17:01:42,Xexanoth,but not a Daki Tea Party :)
02-07-2018T17:01:59,Dadrobit,But y tho
02-07-2018T17:02:05,Xexanoth,why not?
02-07-2018T17:02:15,Dadrobit,I just don't get it man.
02-07-2018T17:02:36,Xexanoth,why did we need sythe on a giant Nibbs being all Akira?
02-07-2018T17:02:38,Xexanoth,same thing
02-07-2018T17:02:39,Bgrmystr2,not everyone will get everything lol
02-07-2018T17:02:47,Dadrobit,Hell no it's not.
02-07-2018T17:03:00,Bgrmystr2,"yes actually it is, cuz not everyone will know Akira"
02-07-2018T17:03:01,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-07-2018T17:03:57,Dadrobit,"But like, you have the opportunity to get Tom to draw damned near anything your imagination can come up with. And you want to see Maddie drinking tea with pillows?"
02-07-2018T17:04:09,Dadrobit,"Like, that almost sounds sad tbh."
02-07-2018T17:04:18,Bgrmystr2,"I'd probably pick something different, myself lol"
02-07-2018T17:04:28,Xexanoth,you wanted to a recreation of a famous scene just with different characters
02-07-2018T17:04:31,Dadrobit,(Quite frankly dakis in general are kind of sad)
02-07-2018T17:04:42,Bgrmystr2,but ya gotta play the fandom.
02-07-2018T17:04:59,Bgrmystr2,"even if you like something, if it's not popular with the fandom, it's not gonna win the votes"
02-07-2018T17:05:59,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but it's creatively different, I could have just asked for Natani riding the bike or something, at least I made it fantastical."
02-07-2018T17:06:12,Dadrobit,"Also, I never win votes lol."
02-07-2018T17:06:20,Dadrobit,I think I've only won twice?
02-07-2018T17:06:43,Dadrobit,Valenties Day and once before I think.
02-07-2018T17:06:53,Dadrobit,Valentine's*
02-07-2018T17:07:18,Bgrmystr2,"yeah why do you think the pillows tend to win a lot? Cuz it's a currently popular trend and the hate it gets only draws more attention to it, making it more popular"
02-07-2018T17:07:43,Bgrmystr2,xD it'll ride that train till everyone stops caring
02-07-2018T17:07:49,Bgrmystr2,just like all the other trends
02-07-2018T17:07:51,Dadrobit,"Sheeeeeit, if hate won votes, my Keith/Maddie dinner scene would have won by the second week lol."
02-07-2018T17:08:07,Xexanoth,"to be fair, most pillow wins were in some cute/funny situations that involved dakis"
02-07-2018T17:08:24,Xexanoth,adira is the first pure daki that won unless i misremeber
02-07-2018T17:08:38,Dadrobit,"I was gettin' death threats off of that thing, and I still barely got third at best."
02-07-2018T17:08:43,Bgrmystr2,"nope, xex"
02-07-2018T17:09:03,Bgrmystr2,"phoenix suggested the first Daki, way back when, and I believe it was Kat"
02-07-2018T17:09:23,Bgrmystr2,I think flora followed afterwards
02-07-2018T17:09:30,Bgrmystr2,and the trend began
02-07-2018T17:09:46,Xexanoth,those dakis were already sketches? i thought they were older...
02-07-2018T17:10:03,Bgrmystr2,tom sketched them for the sunday streams yeah
02-07-2018T17:10:15,Bgrmystr2,and the flora / kat dakis both got color
02-07-2018T17:10:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Main reason why I thought so hard on what I wanted to suggest
02-07-2018T17:10:53,Xexanoth,ok i checked you were right
02-07-2018T17:11:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And even now I’m not sure if Flora as Justice would be popular
02-07-2018T17:11:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"If not because it sounds odd, because few would know what it’s referencing"
02-07-2018T17:11:53,Bgrmystr2,I know I don't
02-07-2018T17:12:07,Bgrmystr2,"""Flora as justice"" is just too vague"
02-07-2018T17:12:14,Bgrmystr2,"justice isn't a thing, it's a concept"
02-07-2018T17:12:17,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
02-07-2018T17:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora as Justice of the tarot (fortune cards)
02-07-2018T17:12:36,Bgrmystr2,"see, that's better ll"
02-07-2018T17:12:37,Bgrmystr2,lol
02-07-2018T17:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s my full suggestion
02-07-2018T17:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I gave Tom a reference picture the night I mentioned it, some were interested, but mainly in just the cards themselves and who in TK would fit each"
02-07-2018T17:14:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Among other bits
02-07-2018T17:14:24,FenceEqualizer,Flora as the justice daki of tarots. Win within two weeks
02-07-2018T17:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Well a full interpretation of Justice would be 18+
02-07-2018T17:14:54,Bgrmystr2,not flora
02-07-2018T17:14:57,Bgrmystr2,since she's all furry
02-07-2018T17:15:13,FenceEqualizer,Hah
02-07-2018T17:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"She’s normally portrayed as a nude maiden, which Flora could be since she is in fact covered by said fur"
02-07-2018T17:15:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Nude without being nude™️
02-07-2018T17:17:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured I’ll suggest it and see where it goes
02-07-2018T17:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And see how many see it and go :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
02-07-2018T17:17:54,FenceEqualizer,Honestly wouldn't mind seeing Flora as Justice(nonnude) and if prople don't vote strictly for Flora could always ask for a twokinds tarot rendition. Makes since since people where interested in guessing cards
02-07-2018T17:18:16,FenceEqualizer,Just have to make sure they understand that it's related to fortune cards
02-07-2018T17:18:22,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s 22 major tarot
02-07-2018T17:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see Tom looking forward to drawing 22 cards
02-07-2018T17:19:49,Bgrmystr2,"if it's flora, she can do the full 18+ tarot card so"
02-07-2018T17:19:54,Bgrmystr2,dunno why you wouldn't suggest it
02-07-2018T17:20:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I know that’s my point
02-07-2018T17:20:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unlike some renditions that have a veil doing convenient censorship, Flora could just be"
02-07-2018T17:20:56,SpazztasticKiwi,In all her fuzzy glory
02-07-2018T17:21:28,Bgrmystr2,as she usually is.
02-07-2018T17:21:36,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's normal for her.
02-07-2018T17:22:02,Bgrmystr2,Kinda wanna see it
02-07-2018T17:22:45,FenceEqualizer,It goes without saying that he wouldn't do the full 22 but I wouldn't imagine him doing 2-3. Mostly just got to poke at peoples interest.
02-07-2018T19:41:52,NightMeaty22,Going back up the canyon again cya some time
02-07-2018T19:42:20,CrRAR,Have a fantastic time!

02-07-2018T23:05:03,unsteddyphoenix,I can see it now
02-07-2018T23:05:10,unsteddyphoenix,Suddenly the club music stops
02-07-2018T23:05:16,unsteddyphoenix,Heavy metal starts playing

02-07-2018T23:40:02,Dadrobit,Just a different kind of place. Your home inspires high fantasy like LOTR. Mine makes people think nuclear wasteland.
02-07-2018T23:44:11,unsteddyphoenix,Mm~
02-07-2018T23:44:25,unsteddyphoenix,Except mine doesnt actually have any wizards
02-07-2018T23:44:39,unsteddyphoenix,But yours DOES have fireballdiscoballs
02-07-2018T23:48:38,Dadrobit,Well it's not like Arizona comes with pre-installed DiscoBallFlameThrowers. We gotta make 'em ourselves.
02-07-2018T23:48:47,Dadrobit,Which means you too can make them.
02-07-2018T23:50:19,Dadrobit,Join us unsteddy! Ride eternal! Shiny and chrome!
02-07-2018T23:51:42,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm...I DO want me to be witnessed...
02-07-2018T23:51:55,unsteddyphoenix,Make a tutorial vid for me to folow
02-07-2018T23:52:10,unsteddyphoenix,Secret page of the anarchists cookbook
02-07-2018T23:53:06,Dadrobit,I'll document it and put it up on instructibles. Next best thing.
