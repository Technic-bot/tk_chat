21-10-2018T08:35:05,Dadrobit,"Daaaaang, Aus getting something shipped faster than local continent. That's new."
21-10-2018T08:35:24,unsteddyphoenix,will the sketch stream still be normal time?
21-10-2018T08:35:45,ClockworkTDC,Heres to another 15 years of an amazing webcomic
21-10-2018T08:36:05,Dadrobit,"Honestly, if he finishes this today, I'll be surprised if there will be a stream today either."
21-10-2018T08:36:11,MetalAppleSauce,"He's got a lot of people to colour this time around, unsteddy, I wouldn't be suprised if this takes all day"
21-10-2018T08:36:14,Dadrobit,This looks like it's gonna be some work.
21-10-2018T08:36:41,unsteddyphoenix,yeah this seems like a sizable one
21-10-2018T08:37:05,ClockworkTDC,Agreed
21-10-2018T08:37:24,unsteddyphoenix,cool composition though
21-10-2018T08:37:38,unsteddyphoenix,at least theres not many bodies to draw
21-10-2018T08:37:45,Dadrobit,"Was hoping we could get best protagonist Keiren sitting on the back of Reni, but alas. I shall have to suffer."
21-10-2018T08:38:00,Mippy,XD time for a 7:00am stream
21-10-2018T08:38:24,MetalAppleSauce,"Keiren was not important enough, dad"
21-10-2018T08:38:33,Dadrobit,You take that back
21-10-2018T08:38:35,Dadrobit,slander

21-10-2018T08:38:58,Dadrobit,"Yrah, noticed that"
21-10-2018T08:39:01,Dadrobit,yeah*
21-10-2018T08:39:12,Dadrobit,Maeve made it though.
21-10-2018T08:39:17,ClockworkTDC,lol
21-10-2018T08:39:26,unsteddyphoenix,unpopular desicion likely
21-10-2018T08:39:36,MetalAppleSauce,Maeve's there. No need for Adira.
21-10-2018T08:39:40,Zakuru,they aren't in the tavern anymore
21-10-2018T08:39:51,Zakuru,they are in ... the MANOR
21-10-2018T08:40:10,MetalAppleSauce,Yea who says Adira's gonna be with Maeve here?
21-10-2018T08:40:20,Twokinds,Maeve is small
21-10-2018T08:40:22,Twokinds,She can fit
21-10-2018T08:40:28,MetalAppleSauce,Mabye Adira trusts the forgetful tyrant
21-10-2018T08:40:28,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, still can't place the keidran next to Red. Gonna feel dumb when it comes to be someone obvious..."
21-10-2018T08:40:29,ClockworkTDC,Council of the Meaves
21-10-2018T08:40:42,MetalAppleSauce,"Dad, really?"
21-10-2018T08:40:44,unsteddyphoenix,leaving her kid alone with strangers tsk
21-10-2018T08:40:57,ClockworkTDC,Lmao
21-10-2018T08:41:09,SamuelLeumas,"Not total strangers, I mean a couple of them saved the town"
21-10-2018T08:41:10,Dadrobit,Sythe?
21-10-2018T08:41:13,unsteddyphoenix,its sythe
21-10-2018T08:41:17,Dadrobit,Ahhh
21-10-2018T08:41:18,MetalAppleSauce,What other important keidran besides mike has no top hair?
21-10-2018T08:41:23,NeonMitsumi,lol
21-10-2018T08:41:37,MetalAppleSauce,And yes he's important
21-10-2018T08:41:51,Dadrobit,Other important keidran with no top hair also includes 37
21-10-2018T08:42:03,MetalAppleSauce,"He was the fourth character we met in the comic besides Trace, Flora, and Ephemural"
21-10-2018T08:42:07,ClockworkTDC,"I should probably go now even though I pretty much just got here, it is pretty late lol"
21-10-2018T08:42:29,Dadrobit,Have a good one TDC probably
21-10-2018T08:43:09,MetalAppleSauce,"Also, I'm suprised the absense of Kei was your first hint"
21-10-2018T08:43:17,MetalAppleSauce,When Nora is also not here
21-10-2018T08:43:23,Dadrobit,hint?

21-10-2018T08:43:42,NeonMitsumi,"Sleep well, Clock"
21-10-2018T08:43:46,Dadrobit,o/
21-10-2018T08:43:55,MetalAppleSauce,Night clock
21-10-2018T08:44:18,Dadrobit,Nora not being there makes sense. She's sleeping through the party.
21-10-2018T08:44:29,Dadrobit,"Also, HoM&M music hype"
21-10-2018T08:45:02,unsteddyphoenix,also nno king

21-10-2018T08:45:37,Twokinds,I'm pretty impressed you recognize it
21-10-2018T08:45:50,MetalAppleSauce,Regrettably a lot of important characters aren't there for the group photo
21-10-2018T08:46:09,MetalAppleSauce,Because it would be canonically impossible atm
21-10-2018T08:46:16,Twokinds,like who
21-10-2018T08:46:51,MetalAppleSauce,"Your're right, Nora's not important"
21-10-2018T08:47:02,Dadrobit,I loved that game. Dumped many many hours of my youth into it making custom campaigns.
21-10-2018T08:47:11,unsteddyphoenix,"well obviously, landen"
21-10-2018T08:47:25,unsteddyphoenix,the most important chharacter

21-10-2018T08:49:04,Dadrobit,Inn Keeper may very well have been lost in the fire.
21-10-2018T08:49:05,NeonMitsumi,"Tsk, so predicatable."
21-10-2018T08:49:09,Twokinds,Bardin?

21-10-2018T08:51:10,Dadrobit,"Oh man, real coffee sounds good right about now."

21-10-2018T08:59:48,MetalAppleSauce,And occasionally play bohemian rhapsody
21-10-2018T08:59:51,Dadrobit,I'd probably put a few artists above Astley
21-10-2018T08:59:53,Tharkis,kinda gotta agree with AllHailLuna =P
21-10-2018T09:00:14,MetalAppleSauce,"The entire school sings along during bohemian rhapsody, even the staff"
21-10-2018T09:00:16,AllHailLuna,my grammar is horrible right now -.-
21-10-2018T09:01:02,AllHailLuna,Who wouldn't sing along to Queen?
21-10-2018T09:01:15,MetalAppleSauce,The new generation

21-10-2018T09:01:30,MetalAppleSauce,No
21-10-2018T09:01:35,AllHailLuna,That's.... true and sad about the new generation

21-10-2018T09:03:16,MetalAppleSauce,"Seriously though, can someone confirm if that's Zen or Youngtani because I can't tell"
21-10-2018T09:03:26,Dadrobit,Michael Jackson.
21-10-2018T09:03:35,PhilTheIdle,I'd also add The Beatles and Guns N' Roses
21-10-2018T09:04:03,johnwolfarts,k
21-10-2018T09:04:09,Dadrobit,Prince

21-10-2018T09:04:25,unsteddyphoenix,ts not youngtani
21-10-2018T09:04:31,SamuelLeumas,"It'll have to be Zen, Youngtani would have too brief to be added"
21-10-2018T09:04:43,SamuelLeumas,*would have been too brief
21-10-2018T09:04:51,PhilTheIdle,"Elvis Presley, The Beach Boys, R.E.M."
21-10-2018T09:05:40,Dadrobit,Sauce.... That is a tradgedy
21-10-2018T09:05:57,NeonMitsumi,ban from the server
21-10-2018T09:06:05,MetalAppleSauce,"I took interest in my dad's music interest, actually."
21-10-2018T09:06:19,MetalAppleSauce,So stuff like Metallica and Ozzy
21-10-2018T09:06:29,Tharkis,and thus MetalAppleSauce turned into a dad joke!
21-10-2018T09:06:37,Tharkis,wait.... that's dad music?!
21-10-2018T09:06:51,Tharkis,must be old now =(

21-10-2018T09:07:10,MetalAppleSauce,It took a whole decade for Hardwired alone
21-10-2018T09:07:36,Tharkis,"noooooo, i'm old now :ctharkis-ewok:"
21-10-2018T09:07:38,eric190,heyo!

21-10-2018T09:07:49,Dadrobit,Hardwired was super good though
21-10-2018T09:07:51,PhilTheIdle,"Hi, Eric"
21-10-2018T09:07:59,Twokinds,Haha you're old!
21-10-2018T09:08:08,Twokinds,Not like us young folk
21-10-2018T09:08:17,Dadrobit,Just need to get a new Tool album already.
21-10-2018T09:08:25,Twokinds,"Am I right, fellow kids?"

21-10-2018T09:09:01,MetalAppleSauce,Of course Hardwired was good. If you compare it to the early parts of the Trujillo era
21-10-2018T09:09:12,SamuelLeumas,"Oh please, I'm probably only like 5 years younger than you, Tom"
21-10-2018T09:09:14,unsteddyphoenix,im not convinced needs more mojis
21-10-2018T09:09:22,NeonMitsumi,Next thing you know we'll hear Gucci Gang in the stream
21-10-2018T09:09:27,Dadrobit,"Actually, I don't know where my cane is at the moment..."
21-10-2018T09:09:36,Dadrobit,Should probably find that.
21-10-2018T09:09:46,PhilTheIdle,"Please no, Mutsumi."
21-10-2018T09:09:48,MetalAppleSauce,I'm so old I have a tape
21-10-2018T09:10:02,NeonMitsumi,"""Mutsumi"" That's a new one."
21-10-2018T09:10:02,SamuelLeumas,Which tapes? Casettes or VHS?
21-10-2018T09:10:08,MetalAppleSauce,Cassete
21-10-2018T09:10:10,Dadrobit,C'mon. Tape isn't that old. I still have tapes.
21-10-2018T09:10:13,SamuelLeumas,Oof
21-10-2018T09:10:20,Tharkis,"if i recall, i think Tom's only a couple years younger than I"
21-10-2018T09:10:31,MetalAppleSauce,I'd be laura if I had a VHS
21-10-2018T09:10:40,TerraTheWizard,:thinking:
21-10-2018T09:10:52,Tharkis,pops in an 8-track
21-10-2018T09:10:57,Twokinds,Don't you see the cake?
21-10-2018T09:10:59,Twokinds,I'm 15
21-10-2018T09:11:05,SamuelLeumas,Damn it Tom
21-10-2018T09:11:30,unsteddyphoenix,real 15 year ld would use more memojis
21-10-2018T09:11:42,Tharkis,"Tom was born with a pencil in his hand , and drew his first comic page by the time he was out of the maternity ward =)"
21-10-2018T09:12:09,MetalAppleSauce,He already had the first 5 chapters before he even came out of the womb
21-10-2018T09:12:12,PhilTheIdle,He is Trace. That's why he had no memories.
21-10-2018T09:12:12,SamuelLeumas,"Pops out of the wombs, suddenly starts drawing the first page of twokinds"
21-10-2018T09:13:00,PhilTheIdle,I'll be back in a minute. Actually five or ten or so. Bye.
21-10-2018T09:13:37,unsteddyphoenix,secretly the cake acually says 51 dundunn
21-10-2018T09:15:28,MetalAppleSauce,"Zen joined Flora in the no clothes anonymous? Oh boy, why isn't Marv awake yet"
21-10-2018T09:15:59,Twokinds,It's wild to think I started writing Twokinds when I was 15
21-10-2018T09:16:27,SamuelLeumas,Assuming that doesn't include drawing yet
21-10-2018T09:16:51,FennexTheFox,"Yeah.. time flies, doesn't it?"
21-10-2018T09:16:57,MetalAppleSauce,"Page 1 came out on keenspot 15 years ago today, Sam. He was writing before that"
21-10-2018T09:17:11,Twokinds,"I was writing the character earlier in the year, turned 16 in July, and came out with the comic in Oct"
21-10-2018T09:17:14,Dadrobit,Tapes can't possibly be an indicator of oldness. Even I still jam to them. https://i.imgur.com/pvVpCqD.jpg
21-10-2018T09:17:21,Tharkis,"impressive too, so few things that we as people try to do when we're in our teens get abandoned along the way and never turn into anything"
21-10-2018T09:17:24,unsteddyphoenix,you started your career at 15
21-10-2018T09:17:35,SamuelLeumas,"3 months of writing, good thing to start with"
21-10-2018T09:17:37,MetalAppleSauce,Tharkis you mean like Halfkind?
21-10-2018T09:17:56,MetalAppleSauce,Which the cast was basically team B
21-10-2018T09:17:56,Tharkis,"i'm talking in general, not just referring to Tom  lol"
21-10-2018T09:18:36,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I feel that. As a teen, it was either military career, or music."
21-10-2018T09:18:54,Tharkis,"when i was 15, i was helping the state archaeologist excavate a native encampment in my town, and was determined to grow up to be an archaeologist"
21-10-2018T09:18:56,Dadrobit,"Neither came about, butI'm still pretty happy where I'm at."
21-10-2018T09:19:05,MetalAppleSauce,"Speaking of, I'm suprised not one Halfkind-related sketch suggestion waa voted in"
21-10-2018T09:19:15,MetalAppleSauce,Was*
21-10-2018T09:19:29,TerraTheWizard,well a lot of peope don't even know what it is

21-10-2018T09:19:41,Tharkis,"i even went to college with it in mind to study archaeology, but it was my geology professor (also the head of the archaeology dept.)who convinced me ""get a job that pays well, and support / study archaeology on the side, unless you like looking for grant"
21-10-2018T09:19:43,Tharkis,"money full time"""
21-10-2018T09:20:19,Tharkis,"so i became an engineer, and now i collect viking era spearheads, and give lectures on historical blacksmithing >_<"
21-10-2018T09:20:30,Tharkis,engineering pays the bills and lets me persue my hobbies lol
21-10-2018T09:20:43,Dadrobit,"Yeah, got told much the same thing when I studied video game design at ASU. ""Get a decent job elsewhere and make your own games. The industry itself sucks."""
21-10-2018T09:21:45,MetalAppleSauce,And then there's artists
21-10-2018T09:21:51,MrEase,Nibs don't hide in that cake
21-10-2018T09:22:01,Tharkis,"at times i still regret that i didnt follow through with my 15 year old self's passion and actually go into archaeology , but very few people that age ever stick with something anyways"
21-10-2018T09:22:03,MrEase,you're gonna get ate
21-10-2018T09:22:05,Dadrobit,"Ended up dropping out anyways because 19-20 year old me was incapable of making intelligent decisions, but I did get my first taste of being a voice actor there, so that was coo."
21-10-2018T09:22:08,Dadrobit,cool*
21-10-2018T09:22:09,Tharkis,which makes TwoKinds allt he more impressive =)
21-10-2018T09:23:10,MetalAppleSauce,The comic that tries to make it's furry quality not the most important quality but then sunday rolls around
21-10-2018T09:23:31,SamuelLeumas,"""The industry itself sucks."", like today."
21-10-2018T09:23:59,Zakuru,don't you hate it when picarto does an update and the notification just.. wont.. go away

21-10-2018T09:27:22,Zakuru,what do you mean?
21-10-2018T09:27:56,EggRollss,in school I look at my phone and it is the notification for the stream so hey
21-10-2018T09:28:13,MetalAppleSauce,School club
21-10-2018T09:28:30,PhilTheIdle,"Guys, what should I buy: NES or N64?"
21-10-2018T09:28:35,MetalAppleSauce,64
21-10-2018T09:28:38,Dadrobit,N64
21-10-2018T09:28:57,Zakuru,is that even a question?
21-10-2018T09:29:01,MetalAppleSauce,NES is as piratable as candy from a baby
21-10-2018T09:29:57,PhilTheIdle,"Zakuru, since I've only had a SNES and a gameboy I have no idea which one is better."
21-10-2018T09:30:21,Zakuru,how old are you?
21-10-2018T09:30:52,PhilTheIdle,16
21-10-2018T09:30:56,EggRollss,PS4 👌

21-10-2018T09:31:41,EggRollss,Ya but I recommend PS4
21-10-2018T09:31:54,MetalAppleSauce,Gross
21-10-2018T09:32:01,Zakuru,"i like sony and nintendo,"

21-10-2018T09:32:29,TerraTheWizard,"well, xbox has the remastered backwards compatible stuff, so that's good"
21-10-2018T09:32:52,Twokinds,"You know, funny thing is, I held off for so long getting a console"
21-10-2018T09:32:52,TerraTheWizard,so you can play rdr in 4k or whatever
21-10-2018T09:33:05,Twokinds,"I went looking for a PS4 Pro recently, and it's sold out everywhere around me."
21-10-2018T09:33:12,MetalAppleSauce,The sony ponies always use exclusives as ammo against xbox...
21-10-2018T09:33:23,TerraTheWizard,exclusives are the worst
21-10-2018T09:33:43,PhilTheIdle,"If you have a PC and an emulator, you don't need a console."
21-10-2018T09:33:54,Dadrobit,":/ Also, ya know, It's just a platform that I'm comfortable with in general for relaxing."
21-10-2018T09:33:58,Zakuru,hi kynum
21-10-2018T09:34:04,TerraTheWizard,not everything can be emulated though
21-10-2018T09:34:10,MetalAppleSauce,^
21-10-2018T09:34:18,EggRollss,Lol I am addicted to gameing I can't afford a good gameing pc so PS4 is the best for me right now
21-10-2018T09:34:19,DeviantArtist101,"I've not gotten a Xbox or PS4..... I just play on my Xbox-360. Though, I know what you guys are talking about and understand as well :3"
21-10-2018T09:35:29,Kynum,:3
21-10-2018T09:35:31,TerraTheWizard,pretty sure all the new xbox games can be played on win10
21-10-2018T09:35:54,TerraTheWizard,so they're /technically/ pc games too
21-10-2018T09:36:34,TerraTheWizard,also who would've predicted it was the fortnite community that could make playstation cave and do cross platform play
21-10-2018T09:37:02,EggRollss,Idk to bad the game is dead Black ops 4 killed it
21-10-2018T09:37:13,TerraTheWizard,wut

21-10-2018T09:38:12,EggRollss,Well I got to go back to school stuff how long are you going to stream for
21-10-2018T09:38:13,Dadrobit,Wonder if I should pick up RDR 2 at launch or not.
21-10-2018T09:38:45,Dadrobit,"I loved the first, but I wanna see some legit player reviews first."
21-10-2018T09:38:54,TerraTheWizard,bunch of people have a theory that rockstar are lying about it not coming to pc
21-10-2018T09:38:58,Zakuru,who in the story is close to 5'9?
21-10-2018T09:39:06,TerraTheWizard,so people spend money on the console version
21-10-2018T09:39:25,Dadrobit,I'm concerned about bullshit microtrasactions making it a game that I don't want to play.
21-10-2018T09:39:26,TerraTheWizard,"then in 6-9 months ""at great effort we have developed a pc port for rdr2"""
21-10-2018T09:39:49,Alphawolf333,"not surprising, since FF15 was in the same boat"

21-10-2018T09:41:42,Kynum,Nibbly's taking a nibble.
21-10-2018T09:41:59,Dadrobit,Took more than that by the looks of it.
21-10-2018T09:42:25,Kynum,a nobble?
21-10-2018T09:42:26,TerraTheWizard,nibs has totally hollowed out the inside of the cake
21-10-2018T09:42:43,TerraTheWizard,keith will blow the candles out & it'll collapse into a puddle of icing
21-10-2018T09:42:55,Kynum,and then they'll all blame Keith.
21-10-2018T09:43:00,Kynum,It's the perfect crime!
21-10-2018T09:43:01,RandomGuy24,Someone always eats the cake too early.
21-10-2018T09:43:17,TerraTheWizard,"no one ever suspects, *the squirrel*"

21-10-2018T10:03:28,MetalAppleSauce,"I wouldn't even ask for an OC request, as the closest thing I have to an OC is a fusion of Keith and Evals"
21-10-2018T10:04:08,MetalAppleSauce,"or more accurately, a fusion of Evals and the doofy looking keith used as that one emote"
21-10-2018T10:04:14,PhilTheIdle,what does oc mean
21-10-2018T10:04:23,MetalAppleSauce,Original Character

21-10-2018T10:10:42,MetalAppleSauce,My inferior drawing skills are enough to satisfy myself of Keith-Evals fusions
21-10-2018T10:11:17,PhilTheIdle,Will you post the picture on the discord channel?
21-10-2018T10:11:26,NeonMitsumi,Of course we will.

21-10-2018T10:13:09,MetalAppleSauce,each line must be sharper than thousand-fold or Qwe will go nuts
21-10-2018T10:13:10,Tharkis,"when everyone around you is doodlign and drawing, and you want to makesoemthing for them"
21-10-2018T10:13:12,NeonMitsumi,Yay :blue_heart:
21-10-2018T10:13:21,Tharkis,but you're a metalsmith and you cant drag a forge into the art room =P

21-10-2018T10:19:46,NeonMitsumi,coughs.
21-10-2018T10:19:59,MrEase,also speaking of shipping fuel the way Raine is staring at Maren :ptv-excited:
21-10-2018T10:20:16,MetalAppleSauce,Suprised Tom hasn't snuck it into the stream playlist

21-10-2018T10:21:20,MetalAppleSauce,and Marv isn't here to tell me off on that >:3

21-10-2018T10:22:44,Kynum,I don't like being honest.
21-10-2018T10:22:54,NeonMitsumi,...that's the reason?
21-10-2018T10:23:12,PhilTheIdle,Isn't that music from TW3?
21-10-2018T10:23:16,MetalAppleSauce,"Well considering they haven't even met yet, we don't know"
21-10-2018T10:23:42,NeonMitsumi,"Wut, I am asking about Sythe only. How did you even conclude that."
21-10-2018T10:23:53,MrEase,"Sythe is a little more tolerant than most, but he has a tendency to tease"
21-10-2018T10:24:00,MetalAppleSauce,Like a Dad
21-10-2018T10:24:01,MrEase,I guess that combo would make for a good dad

21-10-2018T10:49:02,MrEase,"I think I found TK around 10 years ago, but I've only really been into it since the last 2 years"
21-10-2018T10:49:16,MetalAppleSauce,15 years and they never had a day where they swapped
21-10-2018T10:49:34,BadFoMo,Swapped?
21-10-2018T10:49:48,MetalAppleSauce,Where Mark would draw and Tom would game (badly)
21-10-2018T10:49:55,NeonMitsumi,I don't know who would end up worse in that situation.
21-10-2018T10:49:56,BadFoMo,Ah.
21-10-2018T10:49:59,Huntssmith,lol
21-10-2018T10:50:16,PhilTheIdle,"Actually, there was a series of Mark and Tom playing Orcs Must Die 2."
21-10-2018T10:50:17,MetalAppleSauce,"Most likely Mark, as Tom would get hella recognition"
21-10-2018T10:50:25,Huntssmith,ok tom has brother thats on stream
21-10-2018T10:50:36,MetalAppleSauce,"Yes I know, phil, I meant Tom would take Mark's place for the day and vice versa"

21-10-2018T10:55:56,MetalAppleSauce,"""Merciful Nora"" is the equivalent of ""Dear God!"""

21-10-2018T11:03:37,sunblaze,not yet yes
21-10-2018T11:03:56,MrEase,"Tell that to Evals Mike and Flora in the literal resort room, where they've taken off all their clothes"
21-10-2018T11:04:02,MrEase,I think they've missed the memo

21-10-2018T11:04:38,amenon,Pretty sure Mike isn't nakey on the latest page
21-10-2018T11:04:40,sunblaze,powerful politicians are working on it! (hey thats more believable then the reptiod bullshit)
21-10-2018T11:04:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ahhh look at him <3

21-10-2018T11:06:46,Combak,Do you think he has some fur colored underpants on?
21-10-2018T11:06:53,MetalAppleSauce,No wonder I didn't get told off like 5 times earlier
21-10-2018T11:07:07,amenon,"The color says nothing, but the shape does bring it to 'probably naked'"
21-10-2018T11:07:13,amenon,"Mike deffo has a towel, though"

21-10-2018T11:09:24,MetalAppleSauce,He's Saria reincarnated
21-10-2018T11:09:25,TerraTheWizard,well they've been hanging around a few days in the manor
21-10-2018T11:09:34,TerraTheWizard,probably asked rose about the paintings

21-10-2018T11:10:59,amenon,I very approve of Natani/Keith in this piece
21-10-2018T11:11:08,PlumPudding71,Hello there
21-10-2018T11:11:08,Combak,"BTW, how was the sequel to that game?"
21-10-2018T11:11:13,Combak,Hi Plum!
21-10-2018T11:11:19,MrEase,still not really sure if any keidran would feel pity for past trace given the whole attempted genocide thing
21-10-2018T11:11:19,amenon,I haven't played it yet
21-10-2018T11:11:23,amenon,So nobody answer please xD
21-10-2018T11:11:29,PlumPudding71,"Ooooh, is this a comic cover?"
21-10-2018T11:11:38,MrEase,"even if Mike knows a bout Saria, it feels a little off"
21-10-2018T11:11:45,MetalAppleSauce,"It's the 15th anni thingy, plum"
21-10-2018T11:11:52,amenon,"MrEase: He doesn't feel pity for Trace, he's being cute"
21-10-2018T11:11:57,MetalAppleSauce,"but yeah, I see your point Ease"
21-10-2018T11:12:06,amenon,"(Well, I guess he might feel pity for Trace. Mike is a pretty good guy.)"
21-10-2018T11:12:15,PlumPudding71,"Oh, I forgot about that being a thing"
21-10-2018T11:12:16,MetalAppleSauce,Mike and Evals are good doods
21-10-2018T11:12:28,MetalAppleSauce,Unlike smug fukc below them
21-10-2018T11:12:29,Combak,The word is sympathy.
21-10-2018T11:12:42,amenon,But Mike's being Significantly Sad that Evals presumably wants to go his own way
21-10-2018T11:13:42,MetalAppleSauce,Mike's been sad about the concept of being free
21-10-2018T11:13:54,MetalAppleSauce,Even while he was talking about it with Evals
21-10-2018T11:14:35,amenon,"I don't think he minds being free, but he doesn't want to lose Evals"
21-10-2018T11:14:58,Dadrobit,Aaaaaand I'm back. Free from absolute obligations for just a bit.
21-10-2018T11:15:06,MetalAppleSauce,I think he feels bad for Trace as well as thanking him for freedom
21-10-2018T11:15:08,amenon,*absolute* obligations?
21-10-2018T11:15:17,MetalAppleSauce,so much so that he wants to stay hangin with them
21-10-2018T11:15:33,MetalAppleSauce,Dad confirmed Jedi
21-10-2018T11:15:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I shirked a meeting with a director yesterday, agreed to do the narration this morning yesterday."
21-10-2018T11:16:13,amenon,Something something hamburger
21-10-2018T11:16:16,Dadrobit,Had to do a character for a Haloween Special on the story podcast.
21-10-2018T11:16:44,Combak,Neat!

21-10-2018T11:19:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Does this mean Evals gets the templar air ship?
21-10-2018T11:19:12,MetalAppleSauce,"Huzzah, Evals finally has the doggles in this chapter?"
21-10-2018T11:19:33,amenon,How worried are you that it's a long-con setup so nobody questions it when you're *actually* screaming for your life? :3
21-10-2018T11:19:35,Combak,"Metal, this is just art for the 15th Anniversary."

21-10-2018T11:24:16,MetalAppleSauce,the question is will Tom be willing to actually draw a full-on digimon or will he give us more Natanimon
21-10-2018T11:24:33,sunblaze,thats great tharkis but the digimon idea is even better :D

21-10-2018T14:52:34,CatzArt,actually if you think about it nora has shape shifting powers so playing an actual game of where is nora would be impossible
21-10-2018T14:52:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Holly is sleeping I'm sure
21-10-2018T14:52:40,Bgrmystr2,"check your stream, James. it might be frozen"

21-10-2018T16:06:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Zro does
21-10-2018T16:06:24,Twokinds,I'm wondering if it's okay to tip with dollar coins
21-10-2018T16:06:28,Twokinds,It's all I've got.
21-10-2018T16:06:28,thestooge,Never even ordered a pizza
21-10-2018T16:06:32,TheDixieNutjob,I worked at Amazon as a picker for several months
21-10-2018T16:06:42,TheDixieNutjob,that job sucked
21-10-2018T16:06:54,NeonMitsumi,"Money is money, I guess?"
21-10-2018T16:07:05,Twokinds,You ever pick a pack of pickled peppers?
21-10-2018T16:08:07,TheDixieNutjob,"No, don't remember ever seeing a jar of pickles either"
21-10-2018T16:08:49,TheDixieNutjob,I did however see some anime booby girl figures
21-10-2018T16:08:54,Bgrmystr2,"That'd be probably fine if you did, Tom."
21-10-2018T16:08:57,Xexanoth,as long as it's money people tend to not care wether it's coin or bill
21-10-2018T16:09:14,Bgrmystr2,"Cuz quite a number of people don't even tip at all, in zro's experience"
21-10-2018T16:09:31,Bgrmystr2,"so as long as it's something they can take to the bank and deposit, then you're good"
21-10-2018T16:09:54,Twokinds,People seem to get funny about dollar coins for some reason.
21-10-2018T16:10:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same with 2 dollar bills
21-10-2018T16:10:11,Twokinds,I honestly wish people used them more. And that there were a 2 and 5 dollar coin.
21-10-2018T16:10:22,Bgrmystr2,2 dollar bills had a huge wave of fakes
21-10-2018T16:10:26,Bgrmystr2,if they're not all fake
21-10-2018T16:10:43,Bgrmystr2,so there's a reasoning behind that
21-10-2018T16:10:55,Bgrmystr2,"1 dollar coins, that I don't know about"
21-10-2018T16:11:07,Mippy,....is that how things are in the States. I haven’t seen a $2 bill in years
21-10-2018T16:11:43,TheDixieNutjob,"some people keep their dollar coins, they're so rare these days"
21-10-2018T16:11:53,Xexanoth,we got rid of our 5er coins when we switched to euro
21-10-2018T16:11:55,Xexanoth,way better
21-10-2018T16:11:55,TerraTheWizard,had a conversation with people about this a couple days ago
21-10-2018T16:12:08,TerraTheWizard,"pizza people prefer notes, because pocket weight"
21-10-2018T16:12:10,Twokinds,"I don't know if he still does it, but one year Ron used 2 dollar bills to give away as change at a con once. I think..."
21-10-2018T16:12:34,Bgrmystr2,"yeah the 1 dollar coin is very rare, so people hold onto them"
21-10-2018T16:12:50,Mippy,"Funny, I’ve seen a few American $1 coins mixed into my loonies at work"
21-10-2018T16:12:57,TerraTheWizard,"we used to have £1 notes in the uk, phased them out for the coin in the 80s"
21-10-2018T16:13:14,w0lfmare,"Everyone THINKS $1 coins are rare, so they hold onto them XD"
21-10-2018T16:13:24,Twokinds,Same with 2 dollar bills.

21-10-2018T16:13:28,w0lfmare,You can go to a bank anytime and ask for them
21-10-2018T16:14:00,Bgrmystr2,"The $2 bill is actually rare, though I doubt the $1 coin is as rare"
21-10-2018T16:14:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats how I was able to money from family, I told them I was collecting 2 dollar bills"
21-10-2018T16:14:17,Mippy,"Well, bus is here. Bye bye"
21-10-2018T16:14:23,BadFoMo,Bye.
21-10-2018T16:14:30,w0lfmare,Had someone who thought they got a solid gold coin
21-10-2018T16:14:48,w0lfmare,It was just a $1 coin that was just that pristine
21-10-2018T16:15:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I got some $1 coins from a vending machine awhile ago
21-10-2018T16:15:18,w0lfmare,Because they don't get circulated like other coins
21-10-2018T16:16:04,SpazztasticKiwi,My grandma collects em so I gave her most
21-10-2018T16:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,She and my mom and dad have money from around the world from military service time. Including old $2 bills
21-10-2018T16:39:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though have you gotten your ducks back in a row, Tom"

21-10-2018T18:00:26,Bgrmystr2,even though he tends to do so anyway?
21-10-2018T18:12:03,RimaDraws,hm?
21-10-2018T18:14:21,RimaDraws,i thought he said he would try this evening to sketch stream

21-10-2018T18:28:02,Dadrobit,I'd probably do it a little differently now. But I think it works well enough.
21-10-2018T18:29:47,Bgrmystr2,I'll give it a listen at least
21-10-2018T18:32:14,Ordithus,Good evening!

21-10-2018T18:42:45,RimaDraws,how do you know
21-10-2018T18:43:47,Dadrobit,"Goodness, I dunno if I like that more than even being called a grinding stone."
21-10-2018T18:44:11,Dadrobit,Also where she got the sneaky sneaks from.
21-10-2018T18:44:12,RimaDraws,im serious besides of how he talked in the comic how do you know hes her father
21-10-2018T18:44:44,Bgrmystr2,they're not talkin about the comic I think
21-10-2018T18:44:53,Bgrmystr2,they're talkin about people on the discord
21-10-2018T18:45:03,RimaDraws,ah well you fecking screwed me
21-10-2018T18:45:04,RimaDraws,lol
21-10-2018T18:45:12,Ordithus,"Well, I'm not.  I'm not on any discord"
21-10-2018T18:45:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"TK lynn is maddies dad, Discord lynn is a sassy british boi"
21-10-2018T18:45:22,Ordithus,"So if that's the case, I've been fooled into playing along"
21-10-2018T18:45:35,Bgrmystr2,"It was kinda obvious when marv opened with ""no TK lynn, a discord user named lynn"""
21-10-2018T18:45:39,RimaDraws,thats what i was asking marv
21-10-2018T18:45:40,Dadrobit,"Because it's like he said, he's ""blind to both (sexes)"" because he only has eyes for the King."
21-10-2018T18:45:52,RimaDraws,is that for real true
21-10-2018T18:45:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yepper
21-10-2018T18:46:01,RimaDraws,oh shit
21-10-2018T18:46:08,Bgrmystr2,I'm not buyin it
21-10-2018T18:46:11,Dadrobit,Makes total sense doesn't it.
21-10-2018T18:46:20,RimaDraws,it kinda does
21-10-2018T18:46:33,RimaDraws,i mean the way maddie is so stealthy smart
21-10-2018T18:46:35,CrimsonHelsing,This... Is honestly an excellent theory!
21-10-2018T18:46:35,RimaDraws,not to mention short
21-10-2018T18:46:41,Dadrobit,"Lynn snuck on board, not entirely for Keith, but to keep a watchful eye on Maddie, his daughter."
21-10-2018T18:46:48,Bgrmystr2,the only reason he has eyes for the king is because it's his job to fulfill what the king decrees
21-10-2018T18:47:01,RimaDraws,nah i am gonna go with dadrobit on this one
21-10-2018T18:47:06,Dadrobit,\o/

21-10-2018T18:47:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dad you have one of those too?
21-10-2018T18:48:06,Bgrmystr2,"plus, all the patreon images that imply maddie's father look nothing like lynn"
21-10-2018T18:48:20,Dadrobit,"It mostly consists of you, Rima, and Crimson at this point lol."
21-10-2018T18:48:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
21-10-2018T18:48:30,RimaDraws,crimson is my bf

21-10-2018T18:52:17,RimaDraws,hm...
21-10-2018T18:52:37,Dadrobit,"Also, her fur is the halfway point between the shades of the King and Lynn."
