08-12-2018T00:47:47,RimaDraws,woo
08-12-2018T00:47:51,RimaDraws,i can't do that to save my life
08-12-2018T01:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I got real on it awhile back
08-12-2018T01:01:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Round when I decided I’d have an official inbox and one for personal accounts. Wanted to keep any and all sent to me organized
08-12-2018T01:02:20,Bgrmystr2,accidentallied my thumb. :ptv-whiny:
08-12-2018T01:03:16,Bgrmystr2,but hello I can't type quick so a lurking I will go
08-12-2018T01:11:20,RimaDraws,awwww bgr
08-12-2018T01:11:35,RimaDraws,i need to do that kiwi
08-12-2018T01:13:07,Bgrmystr2,"was holding a small speaker, it jumped out of my hand when I was putting it on the floor and it squished my thumb, bent the nail, not bleeding, but bruised pretty bad and hurts like hell"
08-12-2018T01:13:50,Bgrmystr2,been soaking it in ice water for bout 30-40 mins now..
08-12-2018T01:14:17,Bgrmystr2,"I was in the middle of putting the curtains up, but that'll wait till this doesn't hurt anymore I guess. :/"
08-12-2018T01:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what you get for doing something adult on a Saturday
08-12-2018T01:15:48,RimaDraws,lol kiwi
08-12-2018T01:16:16,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-pouty::ptv-pouty::ptv-whiny::ptv-sad:
08-12-2018T01:16:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But you’re saying it’s a bruise and not a blood blister right?
08-12-2018T01:16:36,Bgrmystr2,i don't know honestly
08-12-2018T01:16:44,Bgrmystr2,it's under the nail
08-12-2018T01:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And how did it bend the nail? Backwards? Folding to a side?
08-12-2018T01:17:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Could be a blood blister. It’s like a pocket of blood under some skin. In your case, under the nail. You relieve pressure by releasing the blood"
08-12-2018T01:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Sanitized needle. VERY GENTLE poke
08-12-2018T01:18:29,Bgrmystr2,"the right half of my left thumb, bout 1/3 deep from the end of the nail. i don't know how it bent, just that that was the most likley the case"
08-12-2018T01:19:14,Bgrmystr2,it's back to normal and doesn't look like the nail bent at all
08-12-2018T01:19:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it’s a bruise, a cotten ball with listerine will fade and start to remove it after a night"
08-12-2018T01:19:51,SpazztasticKiwi,So you didn’t break it? Is it near the quick?
08-12-2018T01:20:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Or edge of the nail?
08-12-2018T01:20:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Have I asked enough questions yet?
08-12-2018T01:20:55,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't break the nail, no. I don't even know what exactly happened, just that it's really purple on that part of the thumb and I dunno what a 'quick' is other than description of speed :v"
08-12-2018T01:21:02,Bgrmystr2,and no you need moar questions
08-12-2018T01:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure how you spell it but the quick is that edge part of your nail at the very beginning where it grows off
08-12-2018T01:22:02,Bgrmystr2,no it's near the edge where you clip it
08-12-2018T01:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Much like the edges of your finger - like you say it is - this “quick” has blood and nerve vessels
08-12-2018T01:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway, sound like there may be a small blood collection under where it bent"
08-12-2018T01:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"I had that happen to me a bit ago, did bend the nail or anything but I tore a piece of the side of my finger off. Blood collected there and under a small bit of the nail"
08-12-2018T01:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Painful. Gotta watch for infection trying to grow
08-12-2018T01:25:18,SpazztasticKiwi,*didnt
08-12-2018T01:28:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, the “quick” isn’t the technical term - it’s “cuticle”/“nail bed”, depending where you’re talking about on the nail"
08-12-2018T01:31:20,Bgrmystr2,aaaaaaa kiwi ded
08-12-2018T01:35:55,Dadrobit,It is 11:30 at night and someone in the neighborhood is blasting Despacito through their subs. I can't work like this....
08-12-2018T01:36:55,Bgrmystr2,no sound level rules at night?
08-12-2018T01:37:04,Dadrobit,"And don't worry about your thumb. Shit happens, it'll be sore for a few days and maybe a bit discolored, but unless it was a 500lb speaker, you're fine."
08-12-2018T01:37:21,Dadrobit,Not really? Not in an HOA.
08-12-2018T01:37:27,Bgrmystr2,naw it was just a little 6inch
08-12-2018T01:37:32,Dadrobit,"Maybe the city has rues, dunno."
08-12-2018T01:38:03,Dadrobit,"Yeah, can't tell you how many times I've smashed a finger doing metalwork with pops. Lost a nail two or three times."
08-12-2018T01:38:16,Bgrmystr2,aww :/
08-12-2018T01:38:23,Bgrmystr2,shit hurts somethin bad
08-12-2018T01:39:54,Dadrobit,"For sure, never fun. But it's almost certainly not broken unless the whole finger swells up. Did that once many years ago with a hand sledge that slipped. That was a real bitch."
08-12-2018T01:40:17,Bgrmystr2,soundsbad
08-12-2018T01:40:37,Dadrobit,Broke the second bone in my left index. It was actually horrendous.
08-12-2018T01:41:05,Bgrmystr2,"gonna let it soak more, will type slow tho :c"
08-12-2018T01:41:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, put an ice pack on it and take some ibuprofen."
08-12-2018T01:41:47,Bgrmystr2,I got some ice water
08-12-2018T01:42:36,Bgrmystr2,good to go :thumbsup:

08-12-2018T01:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m on mobile. Means it counts me as off when I flip apps
08-12-2018T01:52:25,Dadrobit,Hm. Took a gander at local laws. No amplified sounds may be created that such noise can be heard from within closed residential structures located within 500 feet of the boundary of the property from which such noise emanates.
08-12-2018T01:52:47,Dadrobit,I'll give them til midnight.
08-12-2018T01:53:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor wacky teens

08-12-2018T01:53:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not a fan either
08-12-2018T01:54:21,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s one in my town that likes to drive through the Walmart parking lot SPECIFICALLY to blast his radio
08-12-2018T01:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Did it when he worked with me at McHell too
08-12-2018T01:56:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t like car speakers that make your car buzz like a mechanical bee down the road

08-12-2018T13:50:02,TerraTheWizard,i'm guessing they mean for like a rave or something
08-12-2018T13:50:26,TerraTheWizard,unless they really just mean tiger trace on a construction site only wearing shiny yellow armbands
08-12-2018T13:50:33,TerraTheWizard,lol
08-12-2018T13:51:47,CrimsonQuill,Please may someone tell me what's happening?
08-12-2018T13:52:58,TerraTheWizard,dunno
08-12-2018T13:58:41,Dadrobit,"I think it was a play on how Flora couldn't see Tiger Trace, so he put on some high visibility clothing."

08-12-2018T14:04:11,TerraTheWizard,that's a point
08-12-2018T14:04:29,TerraTheWizard,do keidran have colourblindness
08-12-2018T14:04:37,CrimsonQuill,I hope not.
08-12-2018T14:06:12,Dadrobit,"Tigers don't suffer all that much degredation in detail, and they have considerably better visibility in the dark."
08-12-2018T14:06:47,Dadrobit,"Never heard anything about tigers having any amount of coorblindnes, but I'm not exactly an expert."
08-12-2018T14:07:28,CrimsonQuill,I never think of Keidran as having colour-blindness. It would make things confusing.
08-12-2018T14:08:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe not
08-12-2018T14:08:54,Twokinds,All Keidran are blind and see via echolocation
08-12-2018T14:08:58,SpazztasticKiwi,But cats don’t see as sharply as we do all the time

08-12-2018T14:46:54,RimaDraws,Hi mong
08-12-2018T14:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it glossy?
08-12-2018T14:47:32,RimaDraws,It’s bronze as implied for Virgo but it looks it. :3
08-12-2018T14:47:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’m sure you can pull off a good bronze
08-12-2018T14:47:58,RimaDraws,So pretty I can’t wait to try it
08-12-2018T14:48:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m eyeing the Libra but I don’t wear makeup really at all anymore
08-12-2018T14:48:45,MrMongMong,The only lip product I use is my own blood when my cracked lips start to bleed. I should take better care of myself.
08-12-2018T14:49:06,SpazztasticKiwi,The pearl pink is yelling for me though

08-12-2018T14:49:10,RimaDraws,Libra looked so pretty but I wanted to see how much it cost first
08-12-2018T14:50:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Chapstick before bed every night
08-12-2018T14:50:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least often
08-12-2018T14:50:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Baby lips in the morning
08-12-2018T14:50:40,RimaDraws,Or carmex
08-12-2018T14:50:47,RimaDraws,That stuff heals my lips
08-12-2018T14:51:04,MrMongMong,"I'll try that, thanks."
08-12-2018T14:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I got some stuff that smells like strawberries
08-12-2018T14:51:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And one with watermelon
08-12-2018T14:51:30,RimaDraws,Oh yummy
08-12-2018T14:51:47,RimaDraws,Just some advice if you use carmex don’t lick your lips lok
08-12-2018T14:51:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Putting a layer of each per lip and I smell like a summer snack
08-12-2018T14:51:50,RimaDraws,Lol
08-12-2018T14:52:22,MrMongMong,Why no lick?
08-12-2018T14:52:46,RimaDraws,Because it tastes bad lol
08-12-2018T14:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well for one, chapstick is not to be eaten"
08-12-2018T14:53:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Defeats the purpose
08-12-2018T14:53:10,MrMongMong,"I beg to differ, when I was younger, it was my favorite food."

08-12-2018T15:48:05,TerraTheWizard,so i submitted my suggestion the day the form went up

08-12-2018T15:48:13,TerraTheWizard,then yesterday i thought of a better one
08-12-2018T15:48:21,TerraTheWizard,but couldn't write it down at the time
08-12-2018T15:48:24,TerraTheWizard,so forgot it
08-12-2018T15:48:30,CrimsonQuill,Oh no.
08-12-2018T15:48:33,Mandag,I've already submitted my crossover suggestion that will inevitably get slaughtered in the poll.
08-12-2018T15:48:36,w0lfmare,"Not been a big fan of the Kat massage trend, but it's a shame we never got the passive aggressive Eric massage"
08-12-2018T15:48:36,TerraTheWizard,"then today i remembered i had an idea, but not what the idea was"
08-12-2018T15:48:50,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I rather just the flora sleeping :u"
08-12-2018T15:48:56,Bgrmystr2,but Natani is cute too
08-12-2018T15:48:58,CrimsonQuill,"@w0lfmare I don't know, they're kind of hilarious."
08-12-2018T15:49:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,passive aggressive Eric massage? XD
08-12-2018T15:49:19,TerraTheWizard,"pretty much what i feel about the trend, w0lf"
08-12-2018T15:49:49,w0lfmare,"Yeah, would be a funny contrast"
08-12-2018T15:50:00,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard @w0lfmare Do you think there should ever be a Subnautica Sketch?
08-12-2018T15:50:06,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, w0lf. All this damn snow you brought here. ;0P"
08-12-2018T15:50:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I have an idea of a Warhammer 40k crossover: Trace as a Chaos Space Marine, Keith as an Imperial Guard Commissar, Flora as an Eldar Farseer, and Natani as a Tau Fire Warrior."
08-12-2018T15:50:21,CrimsonQuill,"As in, one of the characters in a seamoth."
08-12-2018T15:50:28,TerraTheWizard,could be fun
08-12-2018T15:50:35,Combak,Hey all.
08-12-2018T15:50:36,w0lfmare,Sure if it's done right
08-12-2018T15:50:36,Aphala,Trace = Thousand sons
08-12-2018T15:50:40,Aphala,Prove me wrong
08-12-2018T15:50:42,CrimsonQuill,@PalmettoPathfinder1 The humans of 40k would never let that happen.

08-12-2018T15:52:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Besides, Trace = Thousand Sons makes a lot of sense."
08-12-2018T15:52:40,CrimsonQuill,@PalmettoPathfinder1 it would be cool to see Trace as a guardsman...everyone underestimates the guard.
08-12-2018T15:52:48,MrMongMong,Take care of the child first!
08-12-2018T15:52:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's....true as well.

08-12-2018T15:53:44,Aphala,And he's afraid of vacuum cleaners
08-12-2018T15:53:45,CrimsonQuill,I actually haven't read the 40k books
08-12-2018T15:53:47,TerraTheWizard,i have no idea what any of what you're saying means
08-12-2018T15:53:55,CrimsonQuill,I get all my Lore from White Dwarf and the Wiki
08-12-2018T15:54:17,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard think about the galaxy 40'000 years from now.
08-12-2018T15:54:18,MrMongMong,"Plot Twist: Trace is a vacuum cleaner, and is afraid because he doesn't want to face the truth."
08-12-2018T15:54:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I thought about having Trace as an Ultramarine and Natani as a Space Wolf, but I thought about the Tau and thought well, Natani as a Tau Crisis battlesuit warrior would be cool."
08-12-2018T15:54:32,Aphala,@MrMongMong Spicy twist
08-12-2018T15:54:33,CrimsonQuill,And then think of everyone trying to kill everyone.
08-12-2018T15:54:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,Maybe Keith as an Ultramarine?
08-12-2018T15:54:44,WereKeidran,"man, i've been downloading the closed alpha for anthem for the passed 38 hours! i'll onbly get to play for an hour if i'm lucky"
08-12-2018T15:54:45,Aphala,Everyone is an inquisitor
08-12-2018T15:54:46,CrimsonQuill,Raine could be a Sister of Battle.
08-12-2018T15:54:49,Aphala,Nobody trusts anyone
08-12-2018T15:54:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah I can see Raine as a Sister of Battle.
08-12-2018T15:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Y’all see that the fire alarm went off on Mark’s stream yesterday
08-12-2018T15:55:05,CrimsonQuill,"I'd say Space wolf, but the Space Marines literally cannot recruit women."
08-12-2018T15:55:07,Mippy,Nope
08-12-2018T15:55:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's true.
08-12-2018T15:55:23,CrimsonQuill,I wasn't able to watch Mark's stream
08-12-2018T15:55:35,WereKeidran,space wolf Zen or Sythe?
08-12-2018T15:55:38,CrimsonQuill,"I think next time I go for crossover though, i'll suggest a Subnautica one."
08-12-2018T15:55:51,Mippy,I can’t believe I’m in charge of three people under ten
08-12-2018T15:55:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I just remembered that there are no female Space Marines.  Unless you count the Sisters of Battle.  Anyhow, Maybe Sythe as a Space Wolf."
08-12-2018T15:55:57,CrimsonQuill,"@WereKeidran Maybe, if they were Wulfen."
08-12-2018T15:56:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,That makes sense.
08-12-2018T15:56:16,CrimsonQuill,The Sisters of Battle are not Space Marines...although they can take them on.

08-12-2018T17:17:51,ThingsAreMoving,Must've been a lot of clothes if it took a whole day!
08-12-2018T17:17:57,MviluUatusun,I've seen mistletoe just never seen it used as intended.

08-12-2018T17:18:45,BadFoMo,@Mippy Is it weird if I was thinking about Hanukkah themed requests? ...Or rather the fact that we haven't seen any yet?
08-12-2018T17:18:46,ThingsAreMoving,I remember getting some mistletoe from the forest... my friend is a licensed hunter and we just shot it off trees.
08-12-2018T17:18:46,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Catz
08-12-2018T17:18:49,ThingsAreMoving,fun times
08-12-2018T17:19:16,CatzArt,So what did I miss?
08-12-2018T17:19:24,Mippy,Not at all @BadFoMo It’s an interesting idea
08-12-2018T17:19:24,FoxxTrotter,Stuff.
08-12-2018T17:19:31,ProsePro7,Kick it Kirby!
08-12-2018T17:19:34,CrimsonQuill,@CatzArt most of what I missed

08-12-2018T17:19:48,ThingsAreMoving,first sketch was flora having the urge to climb a christmas tree
08-12-2018T17:19:49,CrimsonQuill,Though I had to go due to bad signal
08-12-2018T17:20:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"In Alabama, it’s “was that fireworks or gunshots?”"
08-12-2018T17:20:24,MviluUatusun,"Flora with an urge to climb a Christmas tree?  Now why would she want to do that.  Oh, yeah.  Cat.  Got it."
08-12-2018T17:20:32,ThingsAreMoving,Well Mvilu in my country you have to have a license and psychological testing just to be able to get a gun
08-12-2018T17:20:45,CrimsonQuill,"In Soviet Russia, Christmas tree climbs up YOU!"
08-12-2018T17:20:54,ThingsAreMoving,so if you want to shoot at trees you better make sure noone is anywhere near to hear it or see it
08-12-2018T17:21:07,MviluUatusun,"Wow!  Now, that seems a wee bit strange, Things.  But, we're working on that here, too."
08-12-2018T17:21:13,SpazztasticKiwi,...so you just admitted to a crime?
08-12-2018T17:21:21,Psychotic1999,"In Soviet Russia, gun own you"
08-12-2018T17:21:24,ThingsAreMoving,"I wasn't the one shooting, kiwi"
08-12-2018T17:21:30,CrimsonQuill,@ThingsAreMoving where I live it's the same.
08-12-2018T17:21:38,BadFoMo,@CrimsonQuill @CatzArt Flora thinking about climbing the tree and Adria helping Maeve put the star on the tree (this one).
08-12-2018T17:21:45,CrimsonQuill,You need a license to own a gun.
08-12-2018T17:21:57,CrimsonQuill,"@BadFoMo it is really cute, isn't it?"
08-12-2018T17:22:02,CatzArt,I hate things like misletoe when conducting prescribed burns. Its what we call a fire ladder(something that allows fire on the ground to move into the canopy)
08-12-2018T17:22:05,FoxxTrotter,New York is going another level on that...requesting one's social media and internet search information in order to obtain or renew a pistol license.
08-12-2018T17:22:20,BadFoMo,@CrimsonQuill They are.
08-12-2018T17:22:22,FoxxTrotter,"Hasn't passed into law yet, though."
08-12-2018T17:22:29,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, a license, psychological testing and a valid reason (just because I want it is not a valid reason, lol)"
08-12-2018T17:22:36,ThingsAreMoving,plus fees

08-12-2018T17:22:56,Aphala,In the UK you'd better have a super duper valid reason if you were even looking to get a firearm

08-12-2018T20:26:45,Bgrmystr2,that's wht instrumental covers of songs with lyrics are great because they lack lyrics but do not suffer from a major part of the song missing.

08-12-2018T20:55:59,Dadrobit,Already a fair few centered around decorating the tree. I wonder if it would behoove me to alter mine to just Sam and Colin doing general decorations?
08-12-2018T20:56:49,unsteddyphoenix,dunno? It mightve just been this weel
08-12-2018T20:56:52,unsteddyphoenix,week*
08-12-2018T20:57:09,Dadrobit,"Is it the week, or the weak is the question..."
08-12-2018T20:57:19,unsteddyphoenix,Yup!
08-12-2018T20:57:35,unsteddyphoenix,"The moth girl did ok in the polls, but I wonder if i should submit to the festivities and do something else.."
08-12-2018T20:57:43,Ordithus,I'll have to rethink my wholesome Raine + Maren suggestion
08-12-2018T20:58:14,unsteddyphoenix,Less or more wholesome
08-12-2018T20:58:18,Dadrobit,"No, I don't need you providing even more competition thank you very much!"
08-12-2018T20:58:24,Ordithus,Plenty wholesome
08-12-2018T20:58:27,Dadrobit,Sill <3 tho

08-12-2018T20:59:48,Dadrobit,"Fuckin' sitting on his throne of like, 20 sketches."
08-12-2018T21:00:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Arent you like, ""second place"" though"
08-12-2018T21:00:19,Dadrobit,I think I'm third?
08-12-2018T21:00:20,Ordithus,Pretorian has got to be getting close
08-12-2018T21:00:34,Dadrobit,But theres a huge gap between you and even second place.
08-12-2018T21:00:41,unsteddyphoenix,"I havent had any of mine picked for like, 5 months now so, maybe"
08-12-2018T21:00:49,unsteddyphoenix,Is there?
08-12-2018T21:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe we should stop suggesting things daddy~
08-12-2018T21:01:01,Dadrobit,Lemme get out the spreadsheet.
08-12-2018T21:01:14,Ordithus,"Didn't you have a suggestion almost weekly at first, unstedd?"
08-12-2018T21:01:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he used to be king
08-12-2018T21:01:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,but then he retired his crown
08-12-2018T21:02:12,unsteddyphoenix,"There was one time where I had two in one month, I think"
08-12-2018T21:05:12,Dadrobit,"Sorry, had to update the lsat week or so."
08-12-2018T21:05:20,Dadrobit,You are at 18 sketches.
08-12-2018T21:05:28,unsteddyphoenix,Youre keeping it updated?
08-12-2018T21:05:28,Dadrobit,Second is at 12
08-12-2018T21:05:31,unsteddyphoenix,Thats useful
08-12-2018T21:05:42,FenceEqualizer,You have a excel doc on that or something?
08-12-2018T21:05:44,unsteddyphoenix,"oh, neat. \o/"
08-12-2018T21:05:47,unsteddyphoenix,Im a winner!
08-12-2018T21:05:58,Ordithus,"Killin' it, too"
08-12-2018T21:06:02,Dadrobit,And second place only has 12 because he has a bonus sketch as well
08-12-2018T21:06:02,unsteddyphoenix,Should I take a break from suggesting things or something? :thinking:
08-12-2018T21:06:14,FenceEqualizer,"Nah, just means you know what the crowd likes."
08-12-2018T21:06:14,unsteddyphoenix,Ive thought about that before
08-12-2018T21:06:15,Ordithus,Never give up
08-12-2018T21:06:17,Dadrobit,I am at 11
08-12-2018T21:06:23,Dadrobit,Never surrender?
08-12-2018T21:06:23,Ordithus,Who is second?
08-12-2018T21:06:42,Dadrobit,SomeOtherTom
08-12-2018T21:06:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think I'm at 5 or so
08-12-2018T21:06:59,FenceEqualizer,Same as Marv.
08-12-2018T21:07:12,Ordithus,"I'm around the same, maybe 6 or 7"
08-12-2018T21:07:17,Dadrobit,"Marv, you have 5"
08-12-2018T21:07:21,unsteddyphoenix,"To be fair, i've been suggesticating from the start"
08-12-2018T21:07:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I came in late
08-12-2018T21:07:41,Dadrobit,"Ord, you're at 8"
08-12-2018T21:07:51,FenceEqualizer,Do you know how many I have?
08-12-2018T21:08:04,Ordithus,Catching up :ptv-excited:
08-12-2018T21:08:21,Dadrobit,"Fence, 7"
08-12-2018T21:08:37,FenceEqualizer,Not bad.
08-12-2018T21:08:53,Dadrobit,"Fence, you have a bonus sketch as well getting you there with the Busty Reni alt"
08-12-2018T21:09:03,unsteddyphoenix,Niiiice~
08-12-2018T21:09:07,FenceEqualizer,XD
08-12-2018T21:10:03,FenceEqualizer,"Not going to lie though, seeing my last piece get so low has me slightly tempted to make a stupid suggestion."
08-12-2018T21:10:14,Dadrobit,"Ah, just went back and re-organized the placements. Second is tied with Torquemeup."
08-12-2018T21:10:21,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes stupid works
08-12-2018T21:10:28,unsteddyphoenix,can confirm
08-12-2018T21:10:31,Dadrobit,Fucking slav squats
08-12-2018T21:10:36,FenceEqualizer,"True but do I really want to be the Reni one piece guy?"""
08-12-2018T21:10:37,Ordithus,haha
08-12-2018T21:11:17,Dadrobit,You also had Strip Poker
08-12-2018T21:11:26,Ordithus,That was a good one
08-12-2018T21:11:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Yes, yes you do"
08-12-2018T21:12:18,FenceEqualizer,:ptv-laugh:
08-12-2018T21:12:33,Dadrobit,I'm very Basitin favored. 8/11 have Basitin.
08-12-2018T21:12:49,Dadrobit,"Only one is an Akira reference, something has gone terribly wrong."
08-12-2018T21:12:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,I got third place with Adelaide and Nat kissing underneath the magical mistletoe and Keith and Flora walk in and see it and get sword tail from it.
08-12-2018T21:13:02,FenceEqualizer,Which took way to long to get Robit
08-12-2018T21:13:26,Dadrobit,"Pffft, that was nothing. Obviously you were not here for the dead Natani saga?"
08-12-2018T21:13:31,FenceEqualizer,I was
08-12-2018T21:13:36,Ordithus,aka Purgatory
08-12-2018T21:13:36,FenceEqualizer,That was nearly a year
08-12-2018T21:13:41,Dadrobit,7 months
08-12-2018T21:13:54,FenceEqualizer,I was there from the start. YOu had So much push back on it
08-12-2018T21:14:06,Dadrobit,#QualityWorthIt
08-12-2018T21:14:10,Ordithus,"In the end, it was a nice piece"
08-12-2018T21:14:41,FenceEqualizer,Did that one get colored?
08-12-2018T21:14:42,Dadrobit,And plenty of mean nasty threats from people in private DM's. Stay classy Picarto Chat.
08-12-2018T21:14:55,FenceEqualizer,....really?
08-12-2018T21:14:59,Dadrobit,"Nah, didn't get colored. One day I'll Nora it."
08-12-2018T21:15:32,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flomad: tell me and BAN
08-12-2018T21:15:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, folks get real upset when you suggest that their pixels get threatened."
08-12-2018T21:15:46,FenceEqualizer,"Yesh, I have nothing against people not liking a suggestion but to be nasty about it?"
08-12-2018T21:15:54,FenceEqualizer,The cult of Nantani is strong
08-12-2018T21:15:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You leave my pixels alone
08-12-2018T21:16:03,Dadrobit,Hey Marv
08-12-2018T21:16:11,Dadrobit,ZenXKat is best ship

08-12-2018T21:17:13,Dadrobit,"I'm just trying to help you, Marv. Help you see the light!"
08-12-2018T21:17:26,FenceEqualizer,They say you shouldn't lie after all.
08-12-2018T21:17:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats no light, that is an infinite abyss that mocks you as you fall forever"
08-12-2018T21:17:49,Dadrobit,"Also, I might steal that idea honestly."
08-12-2018T21:17:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wish I could Nora Card the pic where a drunk (and naked) Nat flirts with Adelaide (who is wearing only a bathrobe) causing the Basitin king to have sword tail.
08-12-2018T21:18:38,Dadrobit,I'll just have to make sure no one comes over so they cannot see my uber-nerd shame.
08-12-2018T21:20:33,Ordithus,"Of all my suggestions, my first is still my fav"

08-12-2018T21:21:07,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh thats a nice one~
08-12-2018T21:21:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The piece that launched Sythe x maren
08-12-2018T21:21:43,FenceEqualizer,Hidden best ship
08-12-2018T21:21:56,Ordithus,A fine vessel
08-12-2018T21:22:33,Ordithus,But Raine x Maren is being built up as a full-fledged Dreadnought class
08-12-2018T21:22:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,meh
08-12-2018T21:23:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I already have my heart sold to Sythe x maren
08-12-2018T21:23:21,unsteddyphoenix,Raine x Maren I think is the way to go
08-12-2018T21:23:29,unsteddyphoenix,Im likin' it more and more
08-12-2018T21:24:02,Dadrobit,Dunno what folks see in Maren. She's kinda... vacuous tbh.
08-12-2018T21:24:36,Ordithus,I don't think that word means what you think it means
08-12-2018T21:24:37,FenceEqualizer,Nothing wrong with a little thorns.
08-12-2018T21:24:45,unsteddyphoenix,You mean Karen?
08-12-2018T21:24:58,Ordithus,That would make more sense
08-12-2018T21:25:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Theres just not enough of her personality wise for me to put her in my list of favs
08-12-2018T21:25:15,Dadrobit,She doesn't really do anything other than that one time she brushed the hair. Other than that?
08-12-2018T21:25:35,Dadrobit,"She doesn't really do stuff, stuf just kinda happens to her and around her."
08-12-2018T21:25:37,Ordithus,She pretty well led Team B until she got KOd
08-12-2018T21:25:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Didnt Raine like, sleep on her"
08-12-2018T21:25:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Raine would have slept on any one who brushed her like that
08-12-2018T21:26:11,Dadrobit,Cuddle slut

08-12-2018T21:30:00,Dadrobit,.... Wasn't Adria x Zen a legit slashfic? Or am I thinking of another Adria ship?

08-12-2018T21:40:45,unsteddyphoenix,hi bgr
08-12-2018T21:41:06,Dadrobit,"Because if I had a dollar for every time I heard ""You know, I could just get this done on Fiverr"" I'd have a down payment on a new car."
08-12-2018T21:41:09,RimaDraws,so @Twokinds i have a question about nora cards. when will any slots open up?
08-12-2018T21:41:31,Dadrobit,"And yes, I will always do my best to be the most excellent."
08-12-2018T21:41:43,Twokinds,I'm a little behind so until I get caught up I'm keeping them at 3
08-12-2018T21:42:06,RimaDraws,its fine i was just wondering so i could grab a slot at some point
08-12-2018T21:43:37,MviluUatusun,"Well, I guess I finished getting ready for work a little too late.  Or, to paraphrase Hank Williams in one of his songs, I'm just in time to be too late."
08-12-2018T21:45:11,RimaDraws,thank you for answering my question
08-12-2018T21:57:58,Bgrmystr2,lol phoenix late hello. It was nice of you to notice me. :ptv-unimpressed::ptv-wondering:
08-12-2018T22:02:30,MviluUatusun,"Well, anyway, I guess I'm outta here.  See y'all next time."
08-12-2018T22:02:39,Ordithus,Bye Mvilu

08-12-2018T22:10:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,..... heh Florbo
08-12-2018T22:15:05,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flomad: FLORBO
08-12-2018T22:15:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
08-12-2018T22:15:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ord were you here for that, Florbo is now stream canon.... I think"
08-12-2018T22:16:11,Ordithus,"No, I got here pretty late"
08-12-2018T22:16:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Check discord my guy
08-12-2018T22:21:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Is Tom still creepin
08-12-2018T22:22:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Maybe.
08-12-2018T22:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I was gonna try those questions before bed
08-12-2018T22:23:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Was gonna try em right after stream but traffic was awful
08-12-2018T22:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And I got distracted
08-12-2018T22:23:49,RimaDraws,hm
08-12-2018T22:24:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause don’t you think if we got a full set of pinups for the TK girls, they’d go great and sell a good calendar?"
08-12-2018T22:24:54,RimaDraws,i dont know. as its not my choice its tom's
08-12-2018T22:24:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'd buy them
08-12-2018T22:25:01,RimaDraws,i mean it would be nice
08-12-2018T22:25:06,RimaDraws,but its up to him
08-12-2018T22:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah that’d be the thing. He’d have tor draw em. Color em. Set up the production
08-12-2018T22:26:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"A lot of hassle, but its also something that would be used for about a year after that"
08-12-2018T22:26:19,Twokinds,Little late for a calander
08-12-2018T22:26:25,SpazztasticKiwi,For 2020
08-12-2018T22:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It’d give you time to try to get it all settled
08-12-2018T22:27:07,Twokinds,"I think if I would do something like that, I'd rather it be just a pin-up book"
08-12-2018T22:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause we have, what, two actually colored and one only suggested as a sketch?"
08-12-2018T22:27:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Or that
08-12-2018T22:27:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That'd be cool to
08-12-2018T22:27:26,Twokinds,That way it's not restricted to one year
08-12-2018T22:27:37,Twokinds,So I don't end up with stock that can't be given away
08-12-2018T22:28:06,Twokinds,Also you just made me realize how close 2020 is
08-12-2018T22:28:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Almost 1 year away
08-12-2018T22:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I would figure that there could be a “x amount was ordered. X amount will be made and shipped”
08-12-2018T22:28:25,SpazztasticKiwi,To cut waste
08-12-2018T22:28:36,Twokinds,Yeah but I always like to get twice as many printed as needed
08-12-2018T22:28:45,Twokinds,so I can sell at cons or give away to people
08-12-2018T22:28:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Why? Do you self destruct in 2020 or something?
08-12-2018T22:29:08,Bgrmystr2,yes obviously.
08-12-2018T22:29:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,we all do
08-12-2018T22:29:16,Bgrmystr2,everyone does.
08-12-2018T22:29:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or limited amount being made, special edition thing"
08-12-2018T22:29:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,We about to get thanos'd
08-12-2018T22:29:31,Twokinds,We will finally be able to say we're in the 20's
08-12-2018T22:29:38,Bgrmystr2,haha
08-12-2018T22:29:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
08-12-2018T22:29:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
08-12-2018T22:29:48,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if fedoras wills uddenly become cool again
08-12-2018T22:29:49,RimaDraws,lol
08-12-2018T22:29:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Bring back Gatsby fashion
08-12-2018T22:29:59,Bgrmystr2,right now we're in the 10's
08-12-2018T22:30:02,Bgrmystr2,so I mean...
08-12-2018T22:30:05,Bgrmystr2,we're getting there.
08-12-2018T22:30:09,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt roll off the tongue
08-12-2018T22:30:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"In some places, it’s still the 50s"
08-12-2018T22:30:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Not until real gangsters come back teddy
08-12-2018T22:30:24,Bgrmystr2,"yeh phoenix, sadly"
08-12-2018T22:30:45,Twokinds,Just hope it doesn't end like the last 20's did.
08-12-2018T22:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,You have a point
08-12-2018T22:31:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Those were rough times
08-12-2018T22:31:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And doesn’t end like Gastby did
08-12-2018T22:31:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No internet would drive anyone crazy
08-12-2018T22:31:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Gatsby
08-12-2018T22:31:31,unsteddyphoenix,It was the best of times it was the worst of times...mostly the worst
08-12-2018T22:31:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear the spelling
08-12-2018T22:31:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Type faster kiwi
08-12-2018T22:32:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Then there’s the question of my possible holiday suggestion. That’s a bit of a reference to something in the comic but I also hope you saw so I don’t have to repeat it
08-12-2018T22:34:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d hate for it to raise a flag since this is a PG13ish chat and/or cause Patreon to have an asthma attack hyperventilating when or if it gets posted there
08-12-2018T22:35:14,SpazztasticKiwi,for being too suggestive or whatever excuse they think of
08-12-2018T22:40:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tom has his stuff marked as 18+ so I don't think they would flip out
08-12-2018T22:44:06,Bgrmystr2,"doesn't matter, he can just make it visible to patrons only"
08-12-2018T22:44:25,Bgrmystr2,"he does it all the time, so I don't see why it would change anything"
08-12-2018T22:49:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:christmas_tree: Merry Christmas lads :christmas_tree: See ya'll
08-12-2018T22:52:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I still wanna know if he cares to do it if it gets voted
08-12-2018T22:56:21,Bgrmystr2,"what is ""it"" lol"
08-12-2018T23:00:12,Ordithus,See ya Marv

08-12-2018T23:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,So Tom: Nat dribbles some ‘nog down her shirt on accident and asks Keith “wanna taste em?”  Keith proceeds to choke on drink
08-12-2018T23:03:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Y or N
08-12-2018T23:03:40,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
08-12-2018T23:04:41,Twokinds,Seems fine to me
08-12-2018T23:05:15,Ordithus,"Don't forget, Tom made this on his own: https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Natani-sucks-on-Keith-s-106004452"
08-12-2018T23:05:22,Ordithus,God that url XD
08-12-2018T23:05:42,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
08-12-2018T23:05:58,unsteddyphoenix,"How many nora carders have tried to had that redrawn, I wonder..."
08-12-2018T23:06:03,Bgrmystr2,nice of browser to NOT actually load that in a new window when I pressed the button to do so..
08-12-2018T23:06:35,Bgrmystr2,how many even thought about it and wanted that before whatever else they wanted? Probably not many
08-12-2018T23:07:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Well at least I know now my mind isn’t the worst
08-12-2018T23:08:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's not out of the ordinary lol
08-12-2018T23:08:04,Twokinds,I like it when the humor is in the implication
08-12-2018T23:08:21,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s nothing. It wants me to login to DA. then go to the app. Only to relogin
08-12-2018T23:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,???
08-12-2018T23:08:28,Ordithus,Innuendo
08-12-2018T23:08:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not dirty minded. I just have a sexy imagination
08-12-2018T23:09:03,Ordithus,"It's OK, Kiwi, we understand"
08-12-2018T23:12:05,RimaDraws,hm
08-12-2018T23:14:50,BluePhantom90,"so the humor of SNL which we all know was called ""Dick in a box"" is fine as long as its not showing"
08-12-2018T23:16:46,Bgrmystr2,apparently.
08-12-2018T23:19:14,SpazztasticKiwi,“It’s a perfectly unsexual sentence. You’re the pervert”
08-12-2018T23:20:56,BluePhantom90,lol well thats the name of the song
08-12-2018T23:22:29,RimaDraws,lol
08-12-2018T23:23:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I’ve been looking at those TK surveys. A whopping 93% male"
08-12-2018T23:24:05,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
08-12-2018T23:24:12,SpazztasticKiwi,audience
08-12-2018T23:24:20,Ordithus,Wow
08-12-2018T23:24:27,RimaDraws,??
08-12-2018T23:25:55,BluePhantom90,"Well I posted the Amazon one. Would be funny King Adelaide was from a Amazon Basitin's. More funny if her ""real"" mother was taller then her"
08-12-2018T23:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s posted on discord
08-12-2018T23:27:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean I understand. And it explains when I said I was a girl, one dude about had an aneurysm"
08-12-2018T23:27:52,BluePhantom90,lol
08-12-2018T23:28:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:*[There's girls on the internet?!]
08-12-2018T23:28:20,Bgrmystr2,"lol Kiwi, it's only that one discord"
08-12-2018T23:28:24,Bgrmystr2,it's not the entire TK audience
08-12-2018T23:28:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to guess it’s more 50/50ish
08-12-2018T23:28:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause of the romance stuff
08-12-2018T23:28:49,BluePhantom90,and which discord room?
08-12-2018T23:28:50,Bgrmystr2,don't take it for speaking of the whole community lol
08-12-2018T23:28:52,Ordithus,"Hm, yeah, a discord might not be representative"
08-12-2018T23:28:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And cause girls can be pervs too
08-12-2018T23:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,We can just hide it better
08-12-2018T23:29:39,Bgrmystr2,"no, you actually try to hide it"
08-12-2018T23:29:45,Bgrmystr2,we just don't.
08-12-2018T23:29:50,Bgrmystr2,because we don't give a shit xD
08-12-2018T23:30:02,Bgrmystr2,"we have accepted ourselves exactly as we are, for the most part. :P"
08-12-2018T23:30:04,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance:
08-12-2018T23:30:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Its probably still mostly male, but that discord is also probably disproportionate"
08-12-2018T23:30:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's probably accurate ^
08-12-2018T23:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"On there now, it’s a discussion around Nora’s human pictures"
08-12-2018T23:31:07,unsteddyphoenix,Human Nora is crazy hot
08-12-2018T23:31:15,unsteddyphoenix,So tall~
08-12-2018T23:31:15,Ordithus,Quite lovely <3
08-12-2018T23:32:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh
08-12-2018T23:33:07,SpazztasticKiwi,She doesn’t exactly light my fire but whatev
08-12-2018T23:35:51,unsteddyphoenix,She really hoists my pitard
08-12-2018T23:36:21,Bgrmystr2,She uh... confuses my bamboozle. :thinking:

08-12-2018T23:46:33,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-power:
08-12-2018T23:46:57,SpazztasticKiwi,This is a very stupid question but
08-12-2018T23:47:17,Ordithus,"Stupid is as stupid does, that's what momma used to say"
08-12-2018T23:47:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Is RDR2 an online downloadable game or disc/whatever downloadable
08-12-2018T23:49:16,Ordithus,"It's on xbox1 and ps4 only, ""disc"" or download"
08-12-2018T23:49:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Welp
08-12-2018T23:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,And I realize now I coulda just googled
08-12-2018T23:49:59,Ordithus,That's what I did
08-12-2018T23:50:09,Ordithus,"Because I have neither, either"
08-12-2018T23:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Just wondering if it was a “just log into your account to use on another computer” game or bot
08-12-2018T23:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,not
08-12-2018T23:57:25,SpazztasticKiwi,No nicer feeling than a fresh scrubbed clean face
08-12-2018T23:58:07,Ordithus,"Nah, there are nicer feelings.  That is nice though"
