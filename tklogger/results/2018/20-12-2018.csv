20-12-2018T10:31:43,iliar,Did you planning make speechless version for Sketch Comics series?
20-12-2018T10:36:06,Azumachan,"Good morning, Tom, Iliar."
20-12-2018T10:39:16,Twokinds,Uh... I hadn't thought of it.
20-12-2018T10:40:00,iliar,It will be very helpful.
20-12-2018T10:47:12,iliar,I like when the text looks neat in a bubble. This is my fetish.
20-12-2018T10:48:07,iliar,For example:
20-12-2018T10:48:33,iliar,https://pp.userapi.com/c849232/v849232930/3e5b9/16xAKa1BwEE.jpg
20-12-2018T10:48:36,Azumachan,You should add a subsection to the speechless page
20-12-2018T10:48:39,iliar,https://pp.userapi.com/c849532/v849532137/30c72/WN69XwGkFuY.jpg
20-12-2018T10:50:06,iliar,Subsection? I think will be enough attach speechless version to original post.
20-12-2018T10:51:36,Twokinds,I see what you mean
20-12-2018T10:51:41,Twokinds,I feel the same way about speech bubbles
20-12-2018T10:55:09,Twokinds,"Okay, I will make speechless versions"
20-12-2018T11:00:28,Twokinds,I'm sure I can automate the process
20-12-2018T11:05:26,infrawash,hello
20-12-2018T11:11:04,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
20-12-2018T11:15:30,Twokinds,One issue: a lot of sound effects are written onto the sketch itself
20-12-2018T11:15:33,Twokinds,Because it's a sketch
20-12-2018T11:15:53,Twokinds,I can't really do anything about those.
20-12-2018T11:17:00,iliar,If you can remove at least big bubbles it will be very useful.

20-12-2018T14:27:16,CrimsonQuill,"The real question is, if she was in the box...who tied the knot? Or did she tie it from the indside?"

20-12-2018T14:33:36,Azumachan,Dragon magic.
20-12-2018T14:46:19,Twokinds,Couldn't fight the cat instinct to play with the ribbons and ended up tangled.
20-12-2018T14:49:03,Azumachan,That's terrible !
20-12-2018T14:52:38,Azumachan,I wish you all happy holidays.

20-12-2018T15:33:53,Xexanoth,i ordered everything online :/
20-12-2018T15:36:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Some of mine was online
20-12-2018T15:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,But how do you wrap and keep it a secret if you shop with the people
20-12-2018T15:46:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll see ya back at lunch
20-12-2018T15:51:58,Twokinds,Oh we don't bother keeping it secret
20-12-2018T15:52:11,Twokinds,They're not even wrapped they're just out next to the tree.
20-12-2018T15:53:56,KapitanGroszek,did you live in the USA? because in Poland it is 9 pm already from an hour
20-12-2018T16:01:45,CatzArt,USA time.
20-12-2018T16:04:33,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, I should probably start the Christmas shopping myself."
20-12-2018T16:05:54,CatzArt,A little late for christmas shopping eh?
20-12-2018T16:06:22,Twokinds,Is it?
20-12-2018T16:07:15,CatzArt,Its in a couple of days. so dad would be cutting it close
20-12-2018T16:09:46,CatzArt,"Hey Tom I gotta question. Im working on my first digital art piece. Gonna scan my inked line art, then upload it into either Gimp 2.0 or Krita and color it in with my wacom intuos draw tablet. Any pointers?"
20-12-2018T16:10:53,Xexanoth,"eh, i never bought my christmas presents early"
20-12-2018T16:11:12,Xexanoth,as long as you're not buying something big/rare it really doesn't matter
20-12-2018T16:12:22,CatzArt,I just like to avoid the crowds
20-12-2018T16:24:22,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:

20-12-2018T16:32:54,CatzArt,"I should be working on it during the stream so I have any questions, I'll bug you about it ;)"
20-12-2018T16:34:49,KapitanGroszek,"in my country, stream will start at 3 am ;_;"
20-12-2018T16:36:30,CatzArt,there are a few europeans here who wake up to watch.
20-12-2018T16:37:09,CatzArt,you can also watch past videos by clicking on the videos tab
20-12-2018T16:40:56,KapitanGroszek,do not worry. I will be on the stream
20-12-2018T16:43:54,CatzArt,Look forward to seeing you there!

20-12-2018T17:12:02,CrimsonQuill,I've done a bit of art myself...I drew Kessah from Hunters of Salamanstra as a Halo Spartan.
20-12-2018T17:12:20,CrimsonQuill,It must be the best drawing I've ever done so far...I'm improving.7

20-12-2018T17:22:57,Azumachan,What's the plan for today ?
20-12-2018T17:26:30,CrimsonQuill,@Azumachan I honestly haven't got a clue.
20-12-2018T17:30:31,Dadrobit,"I'll probably hit up Wal-Mart at like, 2 in the morning to get kids gifts for the nieces/nephews."
20-12-2018T17:30:55,CrimsonQuill,I'll most likely fall asleep..it's 10:30pm.
20-12-2018T17:31:05,CrimsonQuill,I hate these time zone differences.
20-12-2018T17:31:09,Dadrobit,Get over to Home Depopt for pops to get him some tool stuffs.
20-12-2018T17:31:15,Dadrobit,Depot*
20-12-2018T17:31:21,CrimsonQuill,"Just when everyone is coming out, I have to go to sleep."
20-12-2018T17:31:34,Dadrobit,"Dunno what I'll do for the rest, probably some gift cards."
20-12-2018T17:31:57,CommanderTrace,here is 11:31 pm
20-12-2018T17:31:58,Azumachan,I think it will be the Holiday filler.
20-12-2018T17:32:14,CrimsonQuill,The strip? Most likely
20-12-2018T17:32:39,CrimsonQuill,I've just set the 'Matchmaker Squirrel' pic as my background.
20-12-2018T17:36:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Holiday filler could be the Nibbly with a bow so big on you can only see her legs
20-12-2018T17:36:39,TerraTheWizard,lol
20-12-2018T17:36:55,Azumachan,Mine changes every so often.
20-12-2018T17:36:58,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, is there a stream tonight?"
20-12-2018T17:37:07,SpazztasticKiwi,But she’d be overjoyed because Sythe is the one who gave it to her
20-12-2018T17:37:28,CrimsonQuill,"@SpazztasticKiwi Pardon me, but Raine made her the bow."
20-12-2018T17:37:46,CrimsonQuill,There's a picture on his Deviantart showing her giving it to the squirrel.
20-12-2018T17:39:24,Bgrmystr2,Quill do you see the bigass schedule at the top of the chat that says Fri stream 9pm Eastern?
20-12-2018T17:39:33,CrimsonQuill,No
20-12-2018T17:39:50,CrimsonQuill,Now I do.
20-12-2018T17:39:55,CrimsonQuill,I feel stupid...
20-12-2018T17:40:10,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, I generally just watch the sketch stream."
20-12-2018T17:40:20,Bgrmystr2,it's always there every time you come into the stream
20-12-2018T17:40:26,Bgrmystr2,no matter what you come in for
20-12-2018T17:40:30,CrimsonQuill,9pm Eastern is 2AM Here.
20-12-2018T17:40:33,Bgrmystr2,and it loads there every time the page reloads
20-12-2018T17:40:36,CrimsonQuill,I'm just blind as a bat...
20-12-2018T17:40:54,CrimsonQuill,"I know, I know, I don't see it right in front of me..."
20-12-2018T17:41:02,Bgrmystr2,you're not the only one.
20-12-2018T17:41:04,Bgrmystr2,it happens
20-12-2018T17:41:08,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, true."
20-12-2018T17:41:17,CrimsonQuill,Do you draw a lot?
20-12-2018T17:42:17,Bgrmystr2,I don't draw at all.
20-12-2018T17:42:35,CrimsonQuill,I haven't drawn properly in ages...
20-12-2018T17:42:45,CrimsonQuill,Just doodled in the back of my notebooks.
20-12-2018T17:43:03,CrimsonQuill,"Then, a week ago, I had an idea for a Halo drawing of my own."
20-12-2018T17:43:35,CrimsonQuill,"I wanted to draw Kessah from HoSalamanstra in Halo armour-she'd be Halo Raine's fellow Spartan, in a way."
20-12-2018T17:43:50,CrimsonQuill,Problem-I'm terrified of putting pencil to paper.
20-12-2018T17:44:20,CrimsonQuill,"But I decided, after a few concept doodles, screw it-I'll give it my all, and it'll be what it is."
20-12-2018T17:44:52,CrimsonQuill,"Result-well, the best picture I've done, in my opinion."
20-12-2018T17:45:05,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to send it to Jon Joesco as fanart.
20-12-2018T17:45:27,CrimsonQuill,"Trouble is, the printer's scanner won't work, so I can't scan it in."
20-12-2018T17:49:59,Dadrobit,"Aaaaand, done! https://i.imgur.com/6ywKWGm.jpg"
20-12-2018T17:50:35,CrimsonQuill,What in the world is that?
20-12-2018T17:51:26,Bgrmystr2,the puzzle map he's been talking about every time he comes into the chat
20-12-2018T17:51:35,Dadrobit,1000 piece puzzle of a fake map of Atlantis. Plus a bunch of other locales like Camelot and Elderado.
20-12-2018T17:51:46,CrimsonQuill,"Woah,"
20-12-2018T17:51:53,CrimsonQuill,I can't do those things..
20-12-2018T17:52:15,Dadrobit,"Aye. Not able to work while my laptop is dead, so I dug a puzzle out of the closet."
20-12-2018T17:52:22,Bgrmystr2,No reason you can't do a puzzle.
20-12-2018T17:52:42,Bgrmystr2,"even children and babies do puzzles, albeit simple ones"
20-12-2018T17:52:48,CrimsonQuill,Umm.... would missing pieces and an inherent lack of patience count?
20-12-2018T17:52:54,CrimsonQuill,I can do a few.
20-12-2018T17:53:03,Bgrmystr2,"not really, cuz they're worse than you on that one xD"
20-12-2018T17:53:13,CrimsonQuill,I just never have completed one of the 1000 piece puzzles.
20-12-2018T17:53:47,CrimsonQuill,"I spend my free time reading, sitting on this stream, or trying to get that one blasted Elite in Halo Reach Firefight."
20-12-2018T17:54:00,CrimsonQuill,And doodling.
20-12-2018T17:54:06,CrimsonQuill,Doodling's good.
20-12-2018T17:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I spend my time on YouTube

20-12-2018T20:45:50,Zakuru,most dont
20-12-2018T20:45:57,Zakuru,i have a small following
20-12-2018T20:47:05,CatzArt,"Whats it called and what genre? I'm working on the storyboarding for the first chapter of my comic, which is a high fantasy/ post apocolypse"
20-12-2018T20:47:27,Twokinds,I will be late to the stream
20-12-2018T20:47:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oki doke
20-12-2018T20:47:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance: thanks for the heads up
20-12-2018T20:48:09,Combak,Thanks for the heads up Tom!
20-12-2018T20:48:22,Combak,"... May I have an answer to ""How late?"""
20-12-2018T20:48:26,CatzArt,Thats fine I got bothing better to do.
20-12-2018T20:48:27,Zakuru,its a precanon mini story
20-12-2018T20:49:13,CatzArt,cool zakuru
20-12-2018T20:49:42,Zakuru,its fantasy too but generally complicated lol
20-12-2018T20:50:52,CatzArt,fantasy is always complicated.
20-12-2018T20:54:27,CatzArt,Making my comic's world believable when trying to mesh a medieval historical world with the post apacolypse bits proved to be difficult. Like would everyone still where plate armor if firearms are available was quite a challenge to figure out.
20-12-2018T20:55:34,Zakuru,high fantasy is good
20-12-2018T20:55:53,Zakuru,post apacolyse makes it fun >:3c
20-12-2018T20:57:49,CatzArt,"yeah, buts it more low fantasy as I didnt include magic"
20-12-2018T20:58:42,Zakuru,oof lol thats a whole other system you have to mess with then
20-12-2018T20:59:45,CatzArt,I suppose advanced tech can be considered magic.
20-12-2018T20:59:59,FoxxTrotter,Ey'dere. :0)

20-12-2018T21:06:01,Hg17Lamont2002,My rain finished down here in Maryland
20-12-2018T21:06:11,CatzArt,"Hey Groszek, you made it! Hows 3:00am in Poland?"

20-12-2018T21:09:17,CatzArt,Its a city right on the shore of lake erie
20-12-2018T21:09:31,Zakuru,"oh no, lol i know that catz"
20-12-2018T21:09:35,Zakuru,i read too fast
20-12-2018T21:09:41,ShadowSoap,"Yeah, but that was to my South. Just too much rain too quickly."
20-12-2018T21:09:42,Hg17Lamont2002,I sAw it hit 9:00 and I was like  yo STREAM TIME
20-12-2018T21:09:50,ShadowSoap,Same HG

20-12-2018T21:09:55,Zakuru,"i was meaning, i never heard of a cleveland maryland"
20-12-2018T21:10:17,FoxxTrotter,Yeah...I believe Lodi Point is still cleaning up from that.
20-12-2018T21:10:33,ShadowSoap,"It wasn't much of a flood, but most of the carpet in the basement needs to be replaced."
20-12-2018T21:10:41,ShadowSoap,My room was the main casualty.
20-12-2018T21:10:45,CatzArt,Dont wory Zak I couldnt find maryland on a map. Too many tiny states on the east coast
20-12-2018T21:10:47,Hg17Lamont2002,Dang

20-12-2018T21:11:50,Zakuru,"not at you catz, but these were to some folks in NY who didn't know what maryland was"
20-12-2018T21:11:55,Sammit,Hi everybody
20-12-2018T21:12:00,CatzArt,Hey Sammit
20-12-2018T21:12:04,ShadowSoap,"Nah, nothing did. Just gonna be without a room for the next few weeks. Had to move Christmas upstairs, though."
20-12-2018T21:12:08,ShadowSoap,Hello Sammit
20-12-2018T21:12:11,Hg17Lamont2002,WTH Lol Zak
20-12-2018T21:12:14,Zakuru,hi sammit
20-12-2018T21:12:15,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Sammit."
20-12-2018T21:12:31,Hg17Lamont2002,Ello sammit
20-12-2018T21:12:34,CatzArt,"Did your sump pump fail, Soap?"
20-12-2018T21:13:10,ShadowSoap,The hose burst off when we turned it on. Couldn't reattach it. Had to get the Fire Department to help.
20-12-2018T21:13:27,CatzArt,"ouch, thats rough."
20-12-2018T21:13:33,Hg17Lamont2002,Wow crazy day
20-12-2018T21:13:59,FoxxTrotter,"When I was on the FD up there, we had to do a bunch of cellar pump details. It's nothing new throughout that area."
20-12-2018T21:14:14,CatzArt,I'm glad I live on a hill
20-12-2018T21:14:17,ShadowSoap,Yeah. Our FD was busy tonight.
20-12-2018T21:14:30,Hg17Lamont2002,I live in a flat land incline lol
20-12-2018T21:14:32,FoxxTrotter,I'm sure.
20-12-2018T21:14:52,CatzArt,although my house has been struck by lightning multiple times
20-12-2018T21:15:07,ShadowSoap,"Yowch, Catz. That's uncommon."
20-12-2018T21:15:22,Hg17Lamont2002,I just moved into a new house in August so yet to see anything catastrophic
20-12-2018T21:15:24,FoxxTrotter,"The town I live in now is on the high lands, so we don't have that problem here unless there is poor drainage or low lying areas."
20-12-2018T21:15:30,ShadowSoap,The closest bolt of lightning I've ever seen struck my front yard.
20-12-2018T21:15:55,Hg17Lamont2002,Closest I’ve seen is about 100 yards in the forest in my old neighborhood
20-12-2018T21:15:57,FoxxTrotter,"Most places down here don't have basements, anyway."
20-12-2018T21:15:59,CatzArt,my house is the highest point. plus the 300 foot oak tree up against the house doesnt help either
20-12-2018T21:16:31,Hg17Lamont2002,Dang big tree
20-12-2018T21:17:13,CatzArt,One time lighting stuck it and knocked a branch out which crushed my dads truck
20-12-2018T21:17:24,ShadowSoap,Oof
20-12-2018T21:17:57,CatzArt,The branch made for good firewood though.
20-12-2018T21:18:20,FoxxTrotter,"A tornado that passed through the Savannah, NY area back in 2011 missed my grandfather's old house by less than 1/10 mile."
20-12-2018T21:18:57,ShadowSoap,Really!? I don't remember hearing about that!
20-12-2018T21:19:05,Ordithus,This spring I'll be having some work done on my basement to keep water out
20-12-2018T21:19:30,FoxxTrotter,It was during either in late July or early August of 2011. I can't remember which month.
20-12-2018T21:19:58,ShadowSoap,We're going to be adjusting some things to make sure it doesn't flood again. It's the third time in 4 years.
20-12-2018T21:19:59,FoxxTrotter,It just before my mother and I came up to New York for our annual visit.
20-12-2018T21:20:06,ShadowSoap,I hate rain.
20-12-2018T21:20:38,Hg17Lamont2002,Personally love rain lol
20-12-2018T21:20:46,FoxxTrotter,There was a tornado here in NC back in 2011 that missed Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant by 1/2 mile. That's getting pretty close.
20-12-2018T21:20:48,Ordithus,"I have a sump pump, but the water comes in through the wall.  Not enough drainage underneath, probably"
20-12-2018T21:20:49,CatzArt,I hope you can fix the problem Soap. Also i like rain
20-12-2018T21:20:56,Ordithus,60 year old drain tile is probably clogged up
20-12-2018T21:21:07,ShadowSoap,"Wow, that is bad Ord."
20-12-2018T21:21:14,JeremySenpai,Yo Sage
20-12-2018T21:21:19,Ordithus,"It sounds worse than it is, really. Is only a trickle"
20-12-2018T21:21:20,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-Yo:
20-12-2018T21:21:22,CatzArt,Hey Senpai!
20-12-2018T21:21:37,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Jeremy."
20-12-2018T21:21:41,Hg17Lamont2002,Ello Jeremy
20-12-2018T21:21:43,JeremySenpai,:ptv-dealwithit:Catz
20-12-2018T21:21:51,ShadowSoap,"I prefer snow over rain, since snow doesn't flood your basement."
20-12-2018T21:22:01,JeremySenpai,squints at Lamont
20-12-2018T21:22:03,Hg17Lamont2002,But the snow melts @.@
20-12-2018T21:22:16,Sammit,Hi Jeremy
20-12-2018T21:22:22,ShadowSoap,"Yeah, but usually over a few weeks. Not all in an hour."
20-12-2018T21:22:33,Hg17Lamont2002,Why u quint at me -.-
20-12-2018T21:22:36,Ordithus,Melt is usually the worst part.  The ground is saturated
20-12-2018T21:22:43,Ordithus,And still frozen underneath...
20-12-2018T21:22:45,CatzArt,Also Sage I've made it too page 100 on your web comic. I will complete it before spring semester starts again!
20-12-2018T21:23:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Can I get snow with no melt, please and thank you"
20-12-2018T21:23:07,SageSaga,which one?
20-12-2018T21:23:14,FoxxTrotter,"The large snows up there back in 2007 were not fun, though.  Some places got up to 120 inches of snow in a two-week period."
20-12-2018T21:23:17,Ordithus,"Same, Marv.  That would be ideal"
20-12-2018T21:23:34,CatzArt,"Yosh, Sage. I thought you only had one"
20-12-2018T21:23:38,Ordithus,"Lake Effect, Foxx?"
20-12-2018T21:23:47,SageSaga,I also do a comic called Artificial Incident
20-12-2018T21:23:55,Ordithus,http://ai.katbox.net/
20-12-2018T21:23:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Bob Ross is right, Alaska is the best place on earth"
20-12-2018T21:23:56,SageSaga,much newer- much shorter
20-12-2018T21:23:59,FoxxTrotter,"A bit of frontal and lake effect snow, yes...off Lake Ontario."
20-12-2018T21:24:10,ShadowSoap,My area doesn't get much snow. We're in between the lake effect snow belts.
20-12-2018T21:24:14,Ordithus,"Alaska is amazing.  But it still melts there, Marv"
20-12-2018T21:24:22,FoxxTrotter,"Oswego, NY received over 100 inches during that period."
20-12-2018T21:24:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Not if you go up high enough
20-12-2018T21:24:30,ShadowSoap,"But, we have some snow usually by December"
20-12-2018T21:24:31,Ordithus,Like to the top of Denali?
20-12-2018T21:24:35,ShadowSoap,But my grass is green.
20-12-2018T21:24:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,♪Can you take me higher!♪
20-12-2018T21:25:09,Ordithus,... that's as high as you go in North America
20-12-2018T21:25:18,FoxxTrotter,"Of course...down here in NC, we got over 10 inches of snow last week. XP"
20-12-2018T21:25:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Well, guess that works"
20-12-2018T21:25:27,CatzArt,you can go to alaska
20-12-2018T21:25:45,Ordithus,Denali is in Alaska
20-12-2018T21:25:46,ShadowSoap,"Yeah, and I haven't had any snow in a week or two."
20-12-2018T21:25:50,Ordithus,Big mountain
20-12-2018T21:25:55,Ordithus,Very pretty
20-12-2018T21:25:56,Ordithus,Wow
20-12-2018T21:26:08,ShadowSoap,Would love to visit Alaska.
20-12-2018T21:26:12,Ordithus,Do eeet
20-12-2018T21:26:12,ShadowSoap,But it would be pricey.
20-12-2018T21:26:15,Ordithus,Worth
20-12-2018T21:26:22,FoxxTrotter,Yes...Alaska would be a wonderful visit. :0)
20-12-2018T21:26:22,ShadowSoap,Maybe after College.
20-12-2018T21:26:23,Ordithus,I want to go back
20-12-2018T21:26:40,Ordithus,Went there in the middle of the summer last year
20-12-2018T21:26:40,ShadowSoap,Add it to my list of places to go.
20-12-2018T21:27:11,CatzArt,I wanna go to yellowstone before it explodes
20-12-2018T21:27:16,ShadowSoap,"Have you heard of Chris McCandless, Ord?"
