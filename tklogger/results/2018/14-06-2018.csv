14-06-2018T17:05:36,Xexanoth,"Hey Tom, Patreon gives people an 18+ Warning when visiting your site, might wanna look into that."
14-06-2018T17:35:27,Bgrmystr2,Where does his patreon even link the TK site?
14-06-2018T17:35:32,Bgrmystr2,I don't see a single link
14-06-2018T17:54:02,Xexanoth,when visiting his patreon site...
14-06-2018T17:55:08,Bgrmystr2,yeah I went there.
14-06-2018T17:55:16,Bgrmystr2,There's no links on the patreon site to the comic page.
14-06-2018T17:55:17,Bgrmystr2,none.
14-06-2018T17:55:35,Xexanoth,"people get an 18+ warning when visiting toms patreon site, it has nothing to do with the TK site"
14-06-2018T17:56:26,Bgrmystr2,"you said it was when you visited tom's site from the patreon site, so I was trying to figure out where the link was ll"
14-06-2018T17:56:28,Bgrmystr2,lol
14-06-2018T17:56:47,Bgrmystr2,and yeh I'm not getting any 18+ only message
14-06-2018T17:57:40,Xexanoth,"i didn't even mention tk site, i said ""his site"" as in his patreon site?"
14-06-2018T17:58:15,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: ""his site"" as in the TK site, as I read it."
14-06-2018T17:58:17,Bgrmystr2,rip
14-06-2018T17:59:11,Bgrmystr2,"well, the patreon is not giving me an 18+ message so, I'm not sure"
14-06-2018T17:59:22,Xexanoth,"well, nvm that but yeah, i got an 18+ warning earlier and so did other people as the comments for the sealeen pic show"
14-06-2018T17:59:36,Xexanoth,maybe he already fixed it
14-06-2018T17:59:50,Xexanoth,since he also made a new post
14-06-2018T18:01:03,Bgrmystr2,"dunno, I saw the cat potion image before he made the sketch post, hadn't gotten a 18+"
14-06-2018T18:01:07,Bgrmystr2,maybe just timing
14-06-2018T18:02:20,Xexanoth,"well, i just changed to chrome and it gave me an 18+ warning"
14-06-2018T18:02:36,Xexanoth,it's maybe because you already agreed to 18+ for some other artist and patreon just remembers it
14-06-2018T18:02:52,Bgrmystr2,nope
14-06-2018T18:02:55,Bgrmystr2,I'm not logged in
14-06-2018T18:02:57,Bgrmystr2,I never log in
14-06-2018T18:03:03,Bgrmystr2,I'm not a patreon of anyone.
14-06-2018T18:03:11,Xexanoth,has nothing to do with being logged in
14-06-2018T18:03:12,Bgrmystr2,patron* of anyone
14-06-2018T18:03:28,Xexanoth,"i don't have a patreon acc, and i don't get in in firefox after agreeing to it once, but i still get it in chrom"
14-06-2018T18:03:32,Bgrmystr2,patreon has never given me any 18+ messages ever though o.O
14-06-2018T18:03:39,Bgrmystr2,like never ever
14-06-2018T18:03:40,Xexanoth,hmm weird
14-06-2018T18:03:54,Bgrmystr2,I just go to the page and it opens. always has
14-06-2018T18:04:29,Bgrmystr2,"I do use firefox, I don't use chrome so"
14-06-2018T18:04:36,Bgrmystr2,maybe it's potentially a browser thing?
14-06-2018T18:05:51,Xexanoth,"it happened to me in firefox earlier, i just changed to chrome to see if it happens in something that doesn't ahve patreon cookies"
14-06-2018T18:06:14,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
14-06-2018T18:06:16,Xexanoth,https://imgur.com/a/r9HGELL this is what i get
14-06-2018T18:06:29,Bgrmystr2,wtf
14-06-2018T18:06:34,Bgrmystr2,I have never seen that
14-06-2018T18:06:45,Xexanoth,i didn't either until like 2 hours ago
14-06-2018T18:06:52,Xexanoth,"acutally, mor like 1 hour ago"
14-06-2018T18:06:58,Xexanoth,*actually
14-06-2018T18:08:10,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: Wish I knew.
14-06-2018T18:08:18,Bgrmystr2,I never got age blocked by the site so
14-06-2018T18:08:45,Xexanoth,"just figured it's something tom should know, and since he's gonna stream later i thought i should mention it here"
14-06-2018T18:09:26,Bgrmystr2,"yeah probably something he should look at. If people are getting 18+ messages on the patreon, it's a problem"
14-06-2018T18:14:43,Xexanoth,"hmm i did some testing, i assume patreon just flagged every furry artist for an 18+"
14-06-2018T18:28:30,Matth3w23,"Urgh, gonna have to miss out on the stream. Struggling to keep my eyes open. See you all later, and have fun!"
14-06-2018T18:29:09,Combak,"Wow, that's just plain rude Patreon."
14-06-2018T18:29:17,Combak,EVERY furry artist?
14-06-2018T18:31:23,FuryFaZeFurry,hi
14-06-2018T18:37:55,Xexanoth,"well, i only checked 2 non porn and 2 porn furry artist,all age gated,  but i didn't get an agegate on youtubers or people like cyanide and happiness"
14-06-2018T19:04:40,JamesBSquirrel3,":thermometer_face::sleepy: (yawn) What ta day(!) My Hayfever of Very High Pollen Count on Summer is so paranoid every year, I don't want to lose myself a grip. Just relax + watch the Art session, also latest comic new page appear (sometimes), I'm sure ..."
14-06-2018T19:07:32,JamesBSquirrel3,"... I hope if Tom knows to follow also he don't mind a other things, so whatever. More than 50 mins to LiveStream!:ptv-ice:"
14-06-2018T19:25:17,FenceEqualizer,"Yo Tom, not sure if you're there but just letting you know Patreon slapped your page with an 18+ confirmation. Just letting you know."
14-06-2018T19:25:43,Ordithus,"Good evening.  Also, Tom isn't on the user list."
14-06-2018T19:26:28,Xexanoth,but he will come on eventually and then read it?
14-06-2018T19:26:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Some of his deviant art requires log in and age confirmation too
14-06-2018T19:27:08,SpazztasticKiwi,As it should
14-06-2018T19:27:16,Ordithus,"That he sets manually, though."
14-06-2018T19:28:49,Bgrmystr2,Xex already mentioned it earlier fence.
14-06-2018T19:28:55,Bgrmystr2,and it's not just tom
14-06-2018T19:29:02,Bgrmystr2,it's a lot of people on patreon
14-06-2018T19:29:16,Bgrmystr2,they did a wide sweep of a lot of artists and put adult things on em
14-06-2018T19:29:37,Bgrmystr2,granted I never got hit with the age block
14-06-2018T19:29:58,FuryFaZeFurry,"i srsly played fortnite non-stop all fucking week long....:ptv-confused: well shit, there goes my life:ptv-kippi2:"
14-06-2018T19:30:12,Ordithus,"I just checked using a private session, I get the same age block thing."
14-06-2018T19:30:27,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah a lot of artists apparently have age blocks now, which I figure tom will have to turn off himself, if he hasn't already"
14-06-2018T19:31:01,FuryFaZeFurry,well im glad i made this account over 18 years old
14-06-2018T19:31:12,Ordithus,Sage's patreon seems immune
14-06-2018T19:31:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sage is to op for patreon tos
14-06-2018T19:31:41,FenceEqualizer,Wasn't aware just saw it today and came to make a quick message
14-06-2018T19:31:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Patreon is saying Sage is too pure?
14-06-2018T19:32:02,FenceEqualizer,Hah
14-06-2018T19:32:31,Ordithus,"Huh, I tried a new private session and Tom is no longer blocked.  WTF"
14-06-2018T19:32:58,Bgrmystr2,"""private session"" IE you logged in?"
14-06-2018T19:33:11,Ordithus,"No, private browsing in the browser"
14-06-2018T19:33:17,Ordithus,AKA no cookies
14-06-2018T19:33:20,Bgrmystr2,oh hm
14-06-2018T19:34:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"No private session, and it blocked me"
14-06-2018T19:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Until I clicked ‚Äúyes, I am over 18‚Äù button"
14-06-2018T19:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Boom - in without logging in
14-06-2018T19:38:05,FenceEqualizer,Be funny if they where just hitting anthro artist but yeah if I use my log in it hits me with the 18+ but if I don't log in I can see what I want. ü§î
14-06-2018T19:38:22,Ordithus,That is really weird
14-06-2018T19:38:47,Bgrmystr2,It's never hit me once with any age limiter anything so
14-06-2018T19:38:52,Bgrmystr2,I dunno
14-06-2018T19:41:54,JamesBSquirrel3,"If Tom respond normally were than last week, better not personal nessecery"
14-06-2018T19:42:19,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: uh.

14-06-2018T19:44:11,Ordithus,I don't remember fifteen seconds ago
14-06-2018T19:44:15,Bgrmystr2,"you and english are not friends, are you? lol"

14-06-2018T19:47:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Patreon did update days ago. Age confirmation, as weak and weird as it is, may be the update"
14-06-2018T19:48:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Patreon needs to hurry up with reviewing Infinite's page.

14-06-2018T21:52:13,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, FD."
14-06-2018T21:52:13,Bgrmystr2,"tom's always had it set to that, it just took them till now to add a warning apparently"
14-06-2018T21:52:19,Justanotheruser7118,oh ok
14-06-2018T21:52:20,Bgrmystr2,gnight FD

14-06-2018T21:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Furry boobs. Scary stuff. Gotta restrict it
14-06-2018T21:52:31,TheFDdriver,bye y'all
14-06-2018T21:52:31,Justanotheruser7118,XD
14-06-2018T21:52:32,Bgrmystr2,not that I ever got one
14-06-2018T21:52:39,Bgrmystr2,maybe it's not working all the time?
14-06-2018T21:52:40,Bgrmystr2,or something
14-06-2018T21:52:42,Vatruvius,It is interesting to see that Rose thought this was all a plot of Trace's to bring everyone to the house. Kinda shows what Trace use to be...I wonder what actions she will or will not take knowing his intentions have shifted.
14-06-2018T21:53:08,JamesBSquirrel3,"Right Ron, is on his way the ink draw!"
14-06-2018T21:53:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah vatru
14-06-2018T21:54:02,FenceEqualizer,"""This is my chance to murder Trace and finally leave the house"""
14-06-2018T21:54:13,Bgrmystr2,"this is probably going to be very strange for her, to see the man she's known to be such a horrible person being.. the very opposite of what he was."
14-06-2018T21:54:33,Vatruvius,If she is magically bound to the house would killing Trace remove that spell or not?
14-06-2018T21:54:38,Ordithus,"Though she did know him before he went ""Destroy all Keidrans"""
14-06-2018T21:54:57,Ordithus,Presumably
14-06-2018T21:55:12,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Did she?
14-06-2018T21:55:15,Chalodraws,hey you all
14-06-2018T21:55:17,Vatruvius,True Ord but from the beginning he never thought of Keidran like Saira did...so this is still a big change in her eyes.
14-06-2018T21:55:20,Bgrmystr2,hey Chalo :D
14-06-2018T21:55:21,Combak,Hi Chalo!
14-06-2018T21:55:23,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Chalo."
14-06-2018T21:55:24,Ordithus,She was at least aware of him in TDM
14-06-2018T21:55:36,Ordithus,And was very close to Saria before the wedding
14-06-2018T21:55:53,JamesBSquirrel3,"Y'know in beginning, we actually Trace was like does have awaken by amesisa?"
14-06-2018T21:56:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Chalo
14-06-2018T21:56:21,FenceEqualizer,Went from Murder all Keidran to these guys are my friends. A big change.
14-06-2018T21:56:36,Ordithus,"Good point, Vatru, Fence"
14-06-2018T21:56:44,Bgrmystr2,Indeed Fence
14-06-2018T21:57:03,unsteddyphoenix,Went from kill the keidran to kiss the keidran
14-06-2018T21:57:18,Ordithus,Even though most of them wanted to kill him :ptv-uneasy:
14-06-2018T21:57:19,CrRAR,howbouthat
14-06-2018T21:57:22,Vatruvius,"Well, he kisses one keidran...not all of them."
14-06-2018T21:57:38,Bgrmystr2,"ehh, if he gets taken over by the evil shadow, does it become the kiss of death?"
14-06-2018T21:57:43,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
14-06-2018T21:57:50,unsteddyphoenix,He killed an amount of keidran now he kisses an amount of them
14-06-2018T21:57:51,unsteddyphoenix,Details.
14-06-2018T21:57:55,Vatruvius,"The only other person close to him is Keith, other than that everyone is friends or friends of friends."
14-06-2018T21:57:56,Ordithus,You don't know he hasn't kissed Mike
14-06-2018T21:58:03,FenceEqualizer,Slay the Keidran...not lay the Keidran Trace! - Red...probably
14-06-2018T21:58:10,LEgGOdt1,I need to reread TwoKinds from the beginning again. By any chance is there an audible of TwoKinds @Twokinds?
14-06-2018T21:58:22,Vatruvius,There is that one on youtube.
14-06-2018T21:58:24,Bgrmystr2,not an official one as far as I know
14-06-2018T21:58:27,Bgrmystr2,but lots of fan ones
14-06-2018T21:58:28,Zakuru,"Tom, im sad because i can't go to anthrocon this year ;w; i really wanted to meet you"
14-06-2018T21:58:39,Nekonny,Twokinds abridged?
14-06-2018T21:58:45,Bgrmystr2,rofl
14-06-2018T21:58:45,Nekonny,CB abridged?
14-06-2018T21:58:54,Bgrmystr2,TK abridged would be interesting
14-06-2018T21:58:57,Nekonny,Yosh abridged
14-06-2018T21:59:02,Ordithus,iMew abridged would be... brief
14-06-2018T21:59:04,LEgGOdt1,No it wouldn't
14-06-2018T21:59:10,JamesBSquirrel3,As of Evil Trace got a Emp... I forgot a word what I was trying to say from the Evil Grand Templar was?
14-06-2018T21:59:21,Bgrmystr2,"why would it not, legodt?"
14-06-2018T21:59:21,BadFoMo,"@Nekonny You mean ""**** Yeah TwoKinds""?"
14-06-2018T21:59:26,CrRAR,There's that neat summary on the comic index browser
14-06-2018T22:01:57,JamesBSquirrel3,Oh that's right; Ephemural is what I meant!
14-06-2018T22:03:24,JamesBSquirrel3,That's why a flashback on some pages have on chapters gone back.
14-06-2018T22:04:09,FatCowMom,Hallo
14-06-2018T22:04:17,CrRAR,evenin'
14-06-2018T22:04:18,Ordithus,Hi CowMom
14-06-2018T22:04:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Mom
14-06-2018T22:04:31,Bgrmystr2,heya cow
14-06-2018T22:04:38,Vatruvius,So we know Euchre does not want Rose to let Trace see what is in that room on the 3rd floor whatever it might be. She distrusts him but also distrusts the Templar...will she actually show Trace the room on the 3rd floor and fill in his missing memories if
14-06-2018T22:04:42,FatCowMom,How is everyone
14-06-2018T22:04:54,Vatruvius,she sees Trace is sincere in his change.
14-06-2018T22:05:05,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:that's a good question vat
14-06-2018T22:05:06,Ordithus,Depends on what is in there
14-06-2018T22:05:12,Bgrmystr2,Agree ord
14-06-2018T22:05:23,Bgrmystr2,definitely depends on what's actually in that room
14-06-2018T22:06:06,MrEase,Well I think the reason she suddenly believes he's sincere in his change IS because Euchre came and warned her
14-06-2018T22:06:08,Vatruvius,"It may be that whatever is in there may revert who he is now, in which case Rose might keep it away from him."
14-06-2018T22:06:22,unsteddyphoenix,She might still not believe him completely even now
14-06-2018T22:06:27,unsteddyphoenix,In fact i'd be surprised if she did
14-06-2018T22:06:36,Ordithus,"Indeed, MrEase"
14-06-2018T22:06:44,MrEase,Euchre's warning probably made her realize this was not an act
14-06-2018T22:06:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Or, maybe he'll get his memories back at any time. There's a lot of uncertainties"
14-06-2018T22:07:06,Vatruvius,"Well, I think part of it is the fact that he is actually asking her to fill in his lost memories and the fact that he addresses her differently than she is use to...more polite and with recognition."
14-06-2018T22:07:07,unsteddyphoenix,From her perspective at least
14-06-2018T22:07:17,Bgrmystr2,the fact that Euchre paid her a visit out of nowhere just specifically to tell her this
14-06-2018T22:07:24,Bgrmystr2,There's at least something to it
14-06-2018T22:07:28,Ordithus,"It's probably best if Trace has someone to guide him through his memories, rather than they just come back"
14-06-2018T22:07:34,Bgrmystr2,"if it wasn't important, he wouldn't have done that"
14-06-2018T22:07:51,ZaelLIVEAnimations,Quick question TwoKinds How do you figure out motives for characters
14-06-2018T22:07:56,Vatruvius,"Rose is not stupid, she knows something is up and I think she is walking carefully and revealing nothing."
14-06-2018T22:08:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah vat
14-06-2018T22:08:30,Vatruvius,Uh...you have to be really creative and spend a lot of time thinking Zael
14-06-2018T22:08:59,Vatruvius,I would not say it is something easy to explain.
14-06-2018T22:09:10,Twokinds,Rose has a lot of experience not trusting people
14-06-2018T22:09:21,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
14-06-2018T22:09:30,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
14-06-2018T22:09:36,CrRAR,awwww
14-06-2018T22:09:52,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. it's sad, but it's probably helped her so far"
14-06-2018T22:09:54,Vatruvius,"Best way to think about is if you really create a character you can kinda become that character. You can ""feel"" their motives from whatever past you have created for a character."
14-06-2018T22:09:55,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah Euchre and Trace suddenly showing up and saying things...hard to take those two at face value traditionally
14-06-2018T22:10:17,Ordithus,Especially since they've worked together in the past
14-06-2018T22:10:17,ZaelLIVEAnimations,ok Thanks Vatruvius
14-06-2018T22:10:20,Zakuru,whhhy is she blushing all of a sudden
14-06-2018T22:10:22,Zakuru,I WANNA KNOW
14-06-2018T22:10:30,Vatruvius,That is why I think she is taking this slowly and staying quite where she can.
14-06-2018T22:10:33,unsteddyphoenix,She blushed slightly last page too
14-06-2018T22:10:33,Ordithus,"Euchre is a Master Templar, after all"
14-06-2018T22:10:35,CrRAR,"so thennn... Rose: ""Imma do wha I want!"""
14-06-2018T22:10:58,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-rose:
14-06-2018T22:11:17,Bgrmystr2,"I think she was not used to the respectful way Trace was speaking to her, Zak"
14-06-2018T22:11:22,Bgrmystr2,from the previous page
14-06-2018T22:11:24,Vatruvius,I think she is blushing because she is being treated in a way Trace never has treated her before. Probably in a way no one other than Saira treated her.
14-06-2018T22:11:27,Bgrmystr2,he's done it a couple times before as well
14-06-2018T22:11:30,Bgrmystr2,like at breakfast
14-06-2018T22:11:35,Bgrmystr2,when he invited her to eat with them.
14-06-2018T22:12:32,Ordithus,Forgot about that time.
14-06-2018T22:12:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah she has a slight blush on that page too
14-06-2018T22:12:37,Vatruvius,"If Rose sees Trace in a situation where he will do anything to save Flora while at the same time not losing control, I don't think she will question that he has changed."
14-06-2018T22:12:49,Vatruvius,"If so, then evil Trace was really...evil."
14-06-2018T22:12:52,Bgrmystr2,"so she's definitely not used to trace being respectful to her at all, from what I see"
14-06-2018T22:13:04,Vatruvius,Agreed Bgr.
14-06-2018T22:13:04,MagicEnchilladas,"that looks like a nasty sunburn, Sage"
14-06-2018T22:15:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if she smells flowers or bs
14-06-2018T22:15:10,Vatruvius,?
14-06-2018T22:15:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Her hesitation to Trace‚Äôs change
14-06-2018T22:16:01,SageSaga,"Rose - ""Right before you left you said you were going to give me a raise"""
14-06-2018T22:16:09,CrRAR,xD
14-06-2018T22:16:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
14-06-2018T22:16:20,Twokinds,XD
14-06-2018T22:16:23,Vatruvius,I think she certainly is suspicious by his actions as they are not what she is accustomed to...
14-06-2018T22:16:28,Zakuru,X3
14-06-2018T22:16:29,Vatruvius,lol
14-06-2018T22:16:38,unsteddyphoenix,Cuurrent trace would absolutely fall for that
14-06-2018T22:16:46,BadFoMo,Haha!
14-06-2018T22:17:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Well all that being said, not like she's really in a position of power here."
14-06-2018T22:17:09,CrRAR,mmm so much leverage~
14-06-2018T22:17:12,Vatruvius,"Umm, probably not though he most likely won't be opposed to giving her a raise if she was paid..."
14-06-2018T22:17:29,unsteddyphoenix,"She can be as suspicious as she wants but her only choice really is ""show the third floor or not"""
14-06-2018T22:17:36,ElvenHunter84,"Hey Tom, last week I made a suggestion for a warmup sketch that might have been too lewd"
14-06-2018T22:17:45,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, trace would probably say something like ""I'll one up that. Instead of giving you payment, I'll give you your freedom"" or some sappy shit like that"
14-06-2018T22:17:51,unsteddyphoenix,"If they do have grand machinations in mind, she knows she's not even close to the focus."
14-06-2018T22:17:56,Vatruvius,"If it is too lewd, it won't show up in the polls."
14-06-2018T22:18:07,Char89TheCharizard,Hi Everyone
14-06-2018T22:18:11,CrRAR,hello
14-06-2018T22:18:11,Bgrmystr2,hey char
14-06-2018T22:18:12,BadFoMo,Yo.
14-06-2018T22:19:31,Vatruvius,"Probably Bgr, if he knew he owns her. Though I believe it was Saira that technically owns her so...she is already free? She hid Rose from an execution remember?"
14-06-2018T22:20:29,Twokinds,Yeah Trace doesn't legally own Rose.
14-06-2018T22:20:31,Ordithus,"Questionably canon, Vatru.  That is from a Nora card Tom didn't even remember drawing the sketch for."
14-06-2018T22:20:41,Bgrmystr2,is rose technically free since Saria died?
14-06-2018T22:20:54,Bgrmystr2,I figured she'd be legally tied to the mansion or somesuch thing
14-06-2018T22:20:55,Vatruvius,"So what happens if a slave owner dies, what happens to the slave's status?"
14-06-2018T22:21:01,Bgrmystr2,which would be trace's
14-06-2018T22:21:02,BadFoMo,That reminds me; could Rose just tell Trace a bull **** story about his past?
14-06-2018T22:21:05,Ordithus,Gets buried with their master
14-06-2018T22:21:11,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
14-06-2018T22:21:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Or goes to next of kin
14-06-2018T22:21:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Legally perhaps not, but magically?"
14-06-2018T22:21:35,Vatruvius,"It was colored Ord, a comic short if not a flashback."
14-06-2018T22:21:53,unsteddyphoenix,She mentions it's been a long time since she's been outside
14-06-2018T22:21:54,Twokinds,It really depends.
14-06-2018T22:21:58,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that's what I wasa thinking, phoenix, that trace could probably allow rose the freedom to go wherever she wants"
14-06-2018T22:22:12,Bgrmystr2,and not necessarily be part of the mansion staff
14-06-2018T22:22:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"I thought that since the entrance was enchanted all vampire-like, Rose was physically unable to leave due to a spell"
14-06-2018T22:22:28,unsteddyphoenix,"though, even if she was freed, where would she go?"
14-06-2018T22:22:33,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure lol
14-06-2018T22:22:36,Twokinds,Most end up in servitude to someone else one way or another.
14-06-2018T22:22:39,Vatruvius,I think she is physically unable to leave the estate's ground.
14-06-2018T22:22:44,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
14-06-2018T22:22:45,Twokinds,A lot don't really have any means of getting back to their own lands.
14-06-2018T22:22:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flomad:
14-06-2018T22:22:58,Bgrmystr2,"well vat, that would be trace's way of ""freeing"" her, yeah? lol"
14-06-2018T22:23:06,Bgrmystr2,removing that
14-06-2018T22:23:10,Vatruvius,"Likewise, the estate is the only thing protecting Rose from Euchre and the Templar."
14-06-2018T22:23:18,Bgrmystr2,well yeah that's true too
14-06-2018T22:23:19,Twokinds,"Some are willed land by their owners, which is technically legal, but well..."
14-06-2018T22:23:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Politics
14-06-2018T22:23:32,Twokinds,"Human neighbors like more land, and..."
14-06-2018T22:23:41,frmCast351,oof
14-06-2018T22:23:49,Vatruvius,Work hands for that land.
14-06-2018T22:23:51,unsteddyphoenix,And who'll defend them in human lands
14-06-2018T22:24:03,unsteddyphoenix,probably not the humans~
14-06-2018T22:24:08,Twokinds,Keidran like Adira are fairly uncommon exceptions
14-06-2018T22:24:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúDarling, I don‚Äôt like the new neighbors and I want a new flower garden.‚Äù"

14-06-2018T23:06:07,unsteddyphoenix,True Nibbly is very clean and very good
14-06-2018T23:06:21,unsteddyphoenix,And im sure Sythe gave her a bath at some point
14-06-2018T23:06:34,FuryFaZeFurry,i did nothing but post a message saying i was very proud of myself. Is there anything wrong with that?
14-06-2018T23:06:44,Ordithus,"""Arf!"" :ctwokinds-nibsbounce: She did swim in the hot spring"

14-06-2018T23:08:50,Bgrmystr2,we'll find out soon enough
14-06-2018T23:08:53,Bgrmystr2,hopefully
14-06-2018T23:09:00,FuryFaZeFurry,":ptv-kippi2: well no shit i told you guys who i was, and fucking dadro had it last sunday without me even asking."
14-06-2018T23:09:02,Vatruvius,Hopefully...
14-06-2018T23:09:27,Vatruvius,What is going on? That was sudden.
14-06-2018T23:09:44,FenceEqualizer,What is happening right now is this drama?
14-06-2018T23:09:46,BluePhantom90,wonder what happen with Rose dropping her glasses for... I think it was because he forgot his wife
14-06-2018T23:09:49,Bgrmystr2,xD nothing important
14-06-2018T23:09:53,Ordithus,Fury changes user names frequently is all
14-06-2018T23:10:00,FenceEqualizer,Ahh
14-06-2018T23:10:08,unsteddyphoenix,There should be...some sort of rule about that imo
14-06-2018T23:10:13,Bgrmystr2,there is
14-06-2018T23:10:21,Bgrmystr2,picarto has rules in place for that.
14-06-2018T23:10:26,Bgrmystr2,you can report it.
14-06-2018T23:10:40,FuryFaZeFurry,:ptv-kippi2: go for it m8
14-06-2018T23:10:47,FenceEqualizer,Thought there was a limit on name changing
14-06-2018T23:10:51,Bgrmystr2,There is
14-06-2018T23:10:55,Bgrmystr2,two name changes.
14-06-2018T23:10:58,Bgrmystr2,and two accounts.
14-06-2018T23:11:04,FuryFaZeFurry,im making new accounts....
14-06-2018T23:11:05,Bgrmystr2,"more than that, and they'll ban you"
14-06-2018T23:11:18,unsteddyphoenix,allegedly
14-06-2018T23:11:22,FenceEqualizer,Huh.
14-06-2018T23:11:23,Ordithus,Trace can't handle the tru;th
14-06-2018T23:11:24,Bgrmystr2,allegedly lol
14-06-2018T23:11:30,Vatruvius,"Why though, why not stick with just one account if it does not get banned?"
14-06-2018T23:11:39,Justanotheruser7118,lol that colour
14-06-2018T23:11:45,Bgrmystr2,cuz he wants to get around ppl blocking him
14-06-2018T23:11:48,FenceEqualizer,Attention?
14-06-2018T23:11:55,Bgrmystr2,like they're not gonna figure it out
14-06-2018T23:11:58,Justanotheruser7118,oh nvm
14-06-2018T23:12:36,Vatruvius,"Thing is, if someone blocks you the first time, they will still block you in the new account. So you are just back to where you started."
14-06-2018T23:12:44,FenceEqualizer,Ehh kinda silly if he gets on people nerves they'll just block that. It's like two clicks
14-06-2018T23:12:47,Bgrmystr2,mmmyup vat
14-06-2018T23:13:15,Vatruvius,Best to just stick to your one account and enjoy the chat/streams.
14-06-2018T23:13:39,Vatruvius,Probably a good thing those people block you cause that just removes possible arguments in the chat.
14-06-2018T23:13:44,FuryFaZeFurry,"how would they block any accounts at all, if they dont even know what the username is. i could make a super random account that way you guys would never know."
14-06-2018T23:13:56,ZRO4825,Who cares? o.O
14-06-2018T23:14:05,FuryFaZeFurry,yea who does?
14-06-2018T23:14:07,Vatruvius,But you are still you...
14-06-2018T23:14:17,Bgrmystr2,we too dum to figure it out I guess lol
14-06-2018T23:14:26,Bgrmystr2,:V
14-06-2018T23:14:30,FenceEqualizer,Well it's called being obnoxious. Won't change much if your personality keeps getting on people's nerves
14-06-2018T23:14:31,ZRO4825,"If you're not a prick or moronically annoying, why should we care who you are?"
14-06-2018T23:14:33,Vatruvius,People will find out...that or they will think you are a new 13 year old and block you all the same.
14-06-2018T23:14:39,Vatruvius,"Just leave them be, it is no problem."
14-06-2018T23:14:49,Bgrmystr2,"cuz that's exactly what he was doin, zro. Thus ppl cared enough"
14-06-2018T23:15:02,unsteddyphoenix,Us giving him attention is his only goal. Lets just move on and hope he moves on/gets banned
14-06-2018T23:15:15,Bgrmystr2,xD but it's so hard
14-06-2018T23:15:39,Vatruvius,"I can care less if someone bans me, I do not know them so why would I care if they ban me?"
14-06-2018T23:16:04,FenceEqualizer,You must resist Bgr!
14-06-2018T23:16:05,Vatruvius,"Not sure why this is a big deal to you Fury, just stick to talking to the people who don't mute you or whatever."
14-06-2018T23:16:26,FuryFaZeFurry,i just asked why everyone was so mad (what like ten minutes ago) and now is just gotten out of control.
14-06-2018T23:16:37,Vatruvius,No one was mad...
14-06-2018T23:16:42,FenceEqualizer,No one is
14-06-2018T23:16:48,Vatruvius,I think unsteddy just said you were a 13 year old...

14-06-2018T23:24:50,Vatruvius,That is twice now I mistook people based on slightly similar name colors...
14-06-2018T23:25:00,Bgrmystr2,slightly? XD
14-06-2018T23:25:19,Bgrmystr2,"it's like a vibrant violet vs a super dark purple, going on blue"

14-06-2018T23:25:26,Bgrmystr2,they're very different
14-06-2018T23:25:31,Bgrmystr2,one's closer to red
14-06-2018T23:25:41,Vatruvius,Not on my screen. They are closer than they appear for you.
14-06-2018T23:25:45,Vatruvius,Ord's is brighter though.
14-06-2018T23:25:53,Ordithus,Nearly magenta
14-06-2018T23:25:55,zanAspera,I'm keeping purple.  because my middle name is Violet!

14-06-2018T23:32:37,Bgrmystr2,sounds kinda simple to me

14-06-2018T23:33:30,unsteddyphoenix,Granted the whole paper wasnt dedicated to it but
14-06-2018T23:33:44,Vatruvius,"And I know from my roommate that it was not a fun class to take and I suppose to those who do not like colors, etc have a hard time with it."

14-06-2018T23:34:11,Vatruvius,"Well, by drag your feet I mean a class you have to slug through."
14-06-2018T23:34:13,Bgrmystr2,"well of course if you don't like the subject of a class, no shit you're not gonna like that class XD"
14-06-2018T23:34:26,Bgrmystr2,that kinda applies to everything

14-06-2018T23:34:58,Vatruvius,I guess not.
