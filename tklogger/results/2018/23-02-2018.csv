23-02-2018T00:16:28,TorqueEmUp,I was watching it through the past couple days as well
23-02-2018T00:16:29,SageSaga,https://i.imgur.com/h0ulddI.jpg

23-02-2018T00:17:40,TorqueEmUp,"The only thing that kills me, is I wish it was longer."
23-02-2018T00:18:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah, have you seen the movie?"
23-02-2018T00:18:12,TorqueEmUp,Indeed I have
23-02-2018T00:18:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so good
23-02-2018T00:18:29,TorqueEmUp,I should rewatch that before moving on to re-watching Trigun
23-02-2018T00:18:32,Dadrobit,o/ Beck
23-02-2018T00:19:13,SageSaga,why are we rewatching old anime?
23-02-2018T00:19:23,TorqueEmUp,Because it's good
23-02-2018T00:19:25,NezumiYuki,"Tiger Pilot is looking rather nice there, Tom!"
23-02-2018T00:19:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,because they are so goos
23-02-2018T00:19:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,good
23-02-2018T00:19:54,SageSaga,and new stuff isnt?
23-02-2018T00:20:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not the same feel
23-02-2018T00:20:06,TorqueEmUp,Agreed
23-02-2018T00:20:33,ZRO4825,Can't agree.
23-02-2018T00:20:37,vladtet909,"Has anyone made a ""Get in the damn robot Trace"" joke yet?"
23-02-2018T00:20:38,ZRO4825,Some of the new stuff is &lt;3
23-02-2018T00:20:53,NezumiYuki,"No Vlad, can't say we have... xD"
23-02-2018T00:21:30,Beardozer,"Ah, Asuka Langley. Veeery nice! :heart_eyes: My first anime ""crush"", if such a thing exists."
23-02-2018T00:21:34,TorqueEmUp,"Can't say there has been many new anime's out there that are ""OMG MUST WATCH!"" on the level of Cowboy Bebop or Trigun."
23-02-2018T00:22:05,TorqueEmUp,Granted those are the only two Animes that I can rewatch over and over
23-02-2018T00:22:06,HeresyArtStream,I was pretty huge into Evangelion during my teenage years. Still haven't seen 3.0 though.
23-02-2018T00:22:17,Bgrmystr2,I stil don't understand how someone could like Asuka xD
23-02-2018T00:22:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I just needed a blues and jazz fix, so I rewatched cowboy bebop :D"
23-02-2018T00:22:36,HeresyArtStream,She's the opposite of Shinji and everyone hates Shinji :V

23-02-2018T00:23:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,from wwe?
23-02-2018T00:23:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Is this just your stream playlist or a part of your regular playlist Tom?
23-02-2018T00:23:36,Beardozer,"I like aggressive ladies I guess. Also redhead, which I'm a total sucker for. Also I have had the good fortune to have had a conversation with Tiffany Grant, her english VA. Even got her autograph on a piece of art I had commissioned for the occassion."
23-02-2018T00:23:49,HeresyArtStream,^
23-02-2018T00:24:03,Ordithus,Her suite looks good on Flora
23-02-2018T00:24:13,HeresyArtStream,I used to draw Evangelion characters but that was like 12 years ago. I wonder if I still got it...
23-02-2018T00:24:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"so.... in the words of spike ""I love the kind of women who can kick my ass"""
23-02-2018T00:24:25,Beardozer,exactly
23-02-2018T00:24:28,Bgrmystr2,"I don't want to fight you Heresy, you can have the girl"
23-02-2018T00:24:29,Bgrmystr2,do not want
23-02-2018T00:24:31,TorqueEmUp,"I think Tom generally uses the same playlist for all streams, unless he's in the mood for something else."
23-02-2018T00:25:15,Bgrmystr2,"He does, Torque"
23-02-2018T00:25:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Just wondering if this is his kind of genre
23-02-2018T00:25:23,Beardozer,"the ""shrinking violet"" type just don't catch my fancy. Like a lady that knows what she wants and isn't afraid to claim it with her own effort."
23-02-2018T00:25:38,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
23-02-2018T00:26:17,Bgrmystr2,That's not really what I dislike about her though. She was always just a bitch about things
23-02-2018T00:26:36,Bgrmystr2,a lot of unjustified anger and yelling and just
23-02-2018T00:26:39,Bgrmystr2,"man, fuck that."
23-02-2018T00:26:47,Bgrmystr2,:/
23-02-2018T00:26:53,TorqueEmUp,She does kinda have a bitchy look on her face on that reference picture tom is using.
23-02-2018T00:27:07,Beardozer,"True enough, but that's mostly just a front to mask her deepseat insecurities. I prefer the REBUILD version of her anyway."
23-02-2018T00:27:27,HeresyArtStream,I had today off from work and I thought I was gonna get lots of stuff done. Ended up taking a 5 hour long nap instead. :V
23-02-2018T00:27:37,Ordithus,Nice
23-02-2018T00:27:39,SageSaga,pretty sure she has a good reason for her personality if i remember her history right
23-02-2018T00:27:43,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't see anything other than the original Evangelion, so I dunni"
23-02-2018T00:27:48,Bgrmystr2,dunno* even
23-02-2018T00:27:57,HeresyArtStream,"Asuka has a tragic backstory, as do most characters in Evangelion."
23-02-2018T00:28:00,Bgrmystr2,there's no reason to take your insecurities out on others
23-02-2018T00:28:06,Bgrmystr2,that's just immature and shitty
23-02-2018T00:28:08,NezumiYuki,That's good Her... Sometimes you just gotta shut down and hibernate for a bit to recoop!

23-02-2018T00:32:31,SageSaga,also most actual violence she in-acted was mostly done for anime slapstick
23-02-2018T00:32:31,Beardozer,"Of the girls on offer in the show, yes. Never said she was ""best girl"", just my personal favorite. Everyone likes differant things."

23-02-2018T00:32:39,SageSaga,and Aeoron- stop drinking

23-02-2018T00:33:32,SageSaga,then i will have to ban you from the chat till you are sober
23-02-2018T00:33:33,unsteddyphoenix,!!!!!

23-02-2018T00:34:02,unsteddyphoenix,Sponsor headphones leggo
23-02-2018T00:34:18,HeresyArtStream,I got my headphones from Massdrop. Beyerdynamic Custom One Pros.
23-02-2018T00:34:20,aeoronwah,:ctwokinds-reniderp::ctwokinds-keith8D::ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
23-02-2018T00:34:29,HeresyArtStream,I might eventually replace them with a lighter more loose fitting pair.
23-02-2018T00:34:30,Unenlagia,"I think Keith would do a winter sport, snowboarding maybe?"
23-02-2018T00:34:39,Beardozer,"but if not Asuka, I'd say Misato. Yowza! Except for all the boozing. that's kinda off-putting."
23-02-2018T00:34:42,NezumiYuki,"is so behind in everything, she has no idea who makes a good set of ear phones any more*"
23-02-2018T00:34:48,unsteddyphoenix,thats one~
23-02-2018T00:34:51,Dadrobit,$198.98 GOML
23-02-2018T00:35:01,CrRAR,Keith did shieldsurf that one time
23-02-2018T00:35:03,HeresyArtStream,"Maren would be Misato, obviously."
23-02-2018T00:35:05,Dadrobit,Too much...
23-02-2018T00:35:13,HeresyArtStream,Owns tavern so plenty of booze.
23-02-2018T00:35:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I can't dad, for I'm a bitch with little money"
23-02-2018T00:35:23,Unenlagia,"Hm, Flora... what would she do?"
23-02-2018T00:35:33,TorqueEmUp,I wouldn't even pay more than $50 for a pair of headphones. :P
23-02-2018T00:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Ain‚Äôt nobody got time for no $198.98 headphones
23-02-2018T00:35:50,Unenlagia,High jump.
23-02-2018T00:35:55,HeresyArtStream,You get what you pay for.
23-02-2018T00:35:56,Dadrobit,Shure SRH840's.
23-02-2018T00:35:57,SageSaga,you get what you pay for- unless you buy Beats
23-02-2018T00:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Are they made with unicorns
23-02-2018T00:36:04,SageSaga,then you get garbage for way too much
23-02-2018T00:36:06,CrRAR,lol sage
23-02-2018T00:36:11,NezumiYuki,Wait whut? $200.00 headphones?   Does gotta be Bose Phones for that price!
23-02-2018T00:36:12,Dadrobit,"No, never Beats, just no..."
23-02-2018T00:36:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,agreed
23-02-2018T00:36:18,aeoronwah,Please kill me
23-02-2018T00:36:19,HeresyArtStream,Beats are awful.
23-02-2018T00:36:21,SageSaga,or Astros
23-02-2018T00:36:25,HeresyArtStream,Fart canons for your ears.
23-02-2018T00:36:29,aeoronwah,I can't sit straight up
23-02-2018T00:36:31,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^
23-02-2018T00:36:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Go HyperX
23-02-2018T00:36:43,SageSaga,my current ones are HyperX very comfy good sound
23-02-2018T00:36:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"me too, love em"
23-02-2018T00:36:55,Dadrobit,AKG or Senheiser
23-02-2018T00:36:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl: 1/4 progress on Tom headphones
23-02-2018T00:36:58,TorqueEmUp,"I had HyperX headphones like 10 years ago, they broke within a year"
23-02-2018T00:37:09,HeresyArtStream,AKG K7XX are pretty much the best headphones ever. If I replace my Custom One Pros that's what I'm getting.
23-02-2018T00:37:16,iZute,Did I come at a swell time? I'd say I did
23-02-2018T00:37:21,SageSaga,you should have replaced them since they were under warrenty
23-02-2018T00:37:24,Twokinds,I've never spent more than $25 on a pair of headphones.
23-02-2018T00:37:25,Dadrobit,Or Audio Technica
23-02-2018T00:37:28,HeresyArtStream,AKG K7XXs have excellent audio quality and so light you forget you're wearing them.
23-02-2018T00:37:39,TorqueEmUp,Good man Tom good man
23-02-2018T00:37:51,SpazztasticKiwi,üëçüèª
23-02-2018T00:37:56,TorqueEmUp,Don't buy into that upmarket nonsense
23-02-2018T00:37:57,Beardozer,"Anyway, I'm not saying Asuka is ""waifu"" material. Girl needs a LOT of therapy, but ya can't deny she's a cutie. Also, again, I love redheads. I'm unashamedly biased."
23-02-2018T00:37:58,Unenlagia,I had some Senheiser's on my amazon list forever
23-02-2018T00:38:02,HeresyArtStream,The Custom One Pros sound good but they're closed back design and the band is a little tighter than I'd like.
23-02-2018T00:38:24,HeresyArtStream,My brother got the AKG K7XX set from Mass Drop and they're great.
23-02-2018T00:38:27,BluePhantom90,yeah I only spent $15 for wireless headphones
23-02-2018T00:38:31,CrRAR,oh yeeeah sennheisers are OG
23-02-2018T00:38:34,Ordithus,I bought Bose because I love overpriced goods :D
23-02-2018T00:38:53,SageSaga,what is wrong with you people...
23-02-2018T00:38:54,Ordithus,Though they have lasted quite well
23-02-2018T00:39:09,iZute,Ya'll are talking about headphones while I always get earbuds &lt;-&lt;
23-02-2018T00:39:11,Dadrobit,"There are very legitimate reasons for buying more expensive headphones, they just don't apply to normal consumers for the most part"
23-02-2018T00:39:13,iZute,Cheap amd effective
23-02-2018T00:39:13,HeresyArtStream,"Good headphones cost money, just like a good TV."
23-02-2018T00:39:20,aeoronwah,I'm TRIPLE THE LEGAL LIMIT
23-02-2018T00:39:20,HeresyArtStream,"You wouldn't pay $20 for a TV, right?"
23-02-2018T00:39:31,SageSaga,Tom is not a normal consumer
23-02-2018T00:39:31,aeoronwah,THAT's WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME
23-02-2018T00:39:31,Twokinds,I don't have a tv
23-02-2018T00:39:33,unsteddyphoenix,You wouldnt download some headphones...
23-02-2018T00:39:35,Bgrmystr2,"People in this chat, might Heresy"
23-02-2018T00:39:41,NezumiYuki,What's a TV?
23-02-2018T00:39:46,Unenlagia,"No, but I spent 70 on a $120 monitor"
23-02-2018T00:39:49,BluePhantom90,well I bought Turtlebeach headphones for $150 for my Xbox. but they have gotten really cheaper
23-02-2018T00:39:53,HeresyArtStream,Only TV worth $20 is a used CRT from good will to play old Nintendo games on. :P
23-02-2018T00:40:01,DrTec,hay Tom I has a queston did mark help you build your computer or did you do it on your own?
23-02-2018T00:40:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a T.V. watcher?
23-02-2018T00:40:07,TorqueEmUp,A bigger monitor at a lower price than a monitor
23-02-2018T00:40:10,SageSaga,Aeoronwah im serious about muting you from the chat if you keep this up
23-02-2018T00:40:12,Unenlagia,"Haha, I use Turtlebeach as a cheapo set for my consoles."
23-02-2018T00:40:12,HeresyArtStream,I don't watch TV. I use my TV for games and movies.
23-02-2018T00:40:13,TorqueEmUp,that's what a TV is :P
23-02-2018T00:40:28,Ordithus,same Heresy
23-02-2018T00:40:38,Dadrobit,Yup
23-02-2018T00:40:47,Bgrmystr2,"even though it's not really a cheap brand, Tnen"
23-02-2018T00:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve already muted him, Sage. He‚Äôs not likely going to stop"
23-02-2018T00:40:57,Bgrmystr2,Unen* comeon fingers
23-02-2018T00:41:22,Unenlagia,I got my set for $22
23-02-2018T00:41:22,SageSaga,im not talking about muting him from me im talking about a temporary ban from the chat
23-02-2018T00:41:32,HeresyArtStream,"I got a 42"" Sony Bravia on sale for $300 like a year or two ago. Love it. It's not 4K but I don't have any 4K capable devices so I don't really care."
23-02-2018T00:41:52,HeresyArtStream,If the time comes that I need a bigger TV that's when I'd start looking more seriously into 4K.
23-02-2018T00:41:59,CrRAR,YEH
23-02-2018T00:42:07,NezumiYuki,is trying out her on screen keyboard for the LOLs!
23-02-2018T00:42:12,Twokinds,Cheapest is bestest!
23-02-2018T00:42:12,Beardozer,"Speaking of ""Best girl"", I love the dancing Rem animation, Sage. Very cute! X3"
23-02-2018T00:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I know that‚Äôs what you mean
23-02-2018T00:42:18,TorqueEmUp,"I paid like $500 for a 55"" 4k SmartTV with HDR10 support"
23-02-2018T00:42:25,HeresyArtStream,noice
23-02-2018T00:42:26,unsteddyphoenix,Incorrect! :D
23-02-2018T00:42:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what about wacom tablets Tom?
23-02-2018T00:42:43,NezumiYuki,Speaking of which... Whatcha use Tommy?
23-02-2018T00:42:45,TorqueEmUp,"Not name brand, but name brand just mean a higher price tag"
23-02-2018T00:42:49,HeresyArtStream,"My brother got a 60"" Bravia 4K set for like $700 because it was open box."
23-02-2018T00:42:52,Unenlagia,"What I'd want to do is put a 50"" in the living room and hook my Steam Link to it, grab a bluetooth keyboard and mouse and play some Fallout with the roommates."
23-02-2018T00:42:52,NezumiYuki,What size Cintiq?  :3
23-02-2018T00:42:54,TorqueEmUp,TCL
23-02-2018T00:43:00,Dadrobit,"And that's like people who only need to spend $25 on headphones. They only listen to mp3's any Youtube videos that list themselves as ""BASS BOOSTED VERSION"". But some of us do need flat responses through our cans."
23-02-2018T00:43:01,DrTec,Marv thats the one thing he will spend all his money on
23-02-2018T00:43:02,SageSaga,why do you keep calling him Tommy? no one does that-
23-02-2018T00:43:08,Dadrobit,and*
23-02-2018T00:43:09,DrTec,thats why evrything els has to be cheap
23-02-2018T00:43:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
23-02-2018T00:43:22,NezumiYuki,Okay soz.. Tom then?  ^^
23-02-2018T00:43:28,HeresyArtStream,Not all expensive headphones are Beats garbage.
23-02-2018T00:43:28,unsteddyphoenix,No
23-02-2018T00:43:29,aeoronwah,"Well, since I don't want o get banned I'm gonna go to bed."
23-02-2018T00:43:32,unsteddyphoenix,Call him Steve
23-02-2018T00:43:33,aeoronwah,Night

23-02-2018T00:43:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Aeoron
23-02-2018T00:43:41,unsteddyphoenix,seeya
23-02-2018T00:43:45,Ordithus,"g'night aeron, sleep that off"
23-02-2018T00:43:45,Dadrobit,Night
23-02-2018T00:43:46,Unenlagia,Get some rest
23-02-2018T00:43:47,NezumiYuki,Who's Steve?
23-02-2018T00:43:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,watch out for the hangover in the morning
23-02-2018T00:43:54,Unenlagia,SHTEEB
23-02-2018T00:43:55,HeresyArtStream,My Custom One Pros have a very balanced sound signature and so do the AKG K7XX. They cost more money because the drivers are really big and high quality.
23-02-2018T00:44:01,Bgrmystr2,"Get some rest, Aeoron"
23-02-2018T00:44:06,Bgrmystr2,feel better tomorrow bro :C
23-02-2018T00:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve heard him called multiple names. Tom is what they seem to stick to here, so that‚Äôs what I use"
23-02-2018T00:44:25,TorqueEmUp,"I think the only TVs that would be worth the extra cost would be OLED, but OLEDs DO have serious problems with burn in."
23-02-2018T00:44:27,Dadrobit,"Aye, anything from AKG, Senheiser, SHURE, or Audio Technica is a good bet if it's over $80"
23-02-2018T00:44:33,Ordithus,"Ah, Tom's music isn't tinny tonight!"
23-02-2018T00:44:33,HeresyArtStream,"They're also made of high quality materials like leather and aluminum instead of cheap chinese plastic like Beats by Dre, and you are not wasting money on stupid crap like bass boost."
23-02-2018T00:44:44,NezumiYuki,Awww but but but... What's wrong with calling Tom... Tommy?
23-02-2018T00:44:44,Unenlagia,"Okay, so what Olympic sport would Trace do?"
23-02-2018T00:44:55,Zakuru,chugs painkillers
23-02-2018T00:44:57,HeresyArtStream,Beats by Dre are some of the worst headphones in their price range.
23-02-2018T00:45:06,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^^
23-02-2018T00:45:12,Unenlagia,God yes
23-02-2018T00:45:12,SageSaga,Tom is not the green ranger
23-02-2018T00:45:14,DrTec,Torque I am used to that I have a plasma TV so I am used to preventing burnin
23-02-2018T00:45:24,Dadrobit,They're only expensive so that they can spend money on advertising themselves.
23-02-2018T00:45:27,unsteddyphoenix,Can you prove this?
23-02-2018T00:45:28,Dadrobit,Beats
23-02-2018T00:45:50,HeresyArtStream,I cringed when I saw a marvel movie and Bruce Banner was listening to classical music on a pair of Beats. They are awful for anything more nuanced than dubstep.
23-02-2018T00:45:54,Dadrobit,"Yes, look up frequency response curves on Beats and compare them to any other brand in the same price range."
23-02-2018T00:46:28,HeresyArtStream,Beats are only popular because or marketing and product placement. They give them to celebrities and movie studios to use as props and people assume they must be high quality.
23-02-2018T00:46:28,Dadrobit,You can literally prove that they're worse.
23-02-2018T00:46:57,NezumiYuki,"Sounds like comercialisim again... plugging brands because their ""hip"""
23-02-2018T00:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,They over-advertise
23-02-2018T00:47:08,DrTec,I will stick with my Sol Republic headphones
23-02-2018T00:47:09,Unenlagia,"I ran smack into the same issue with ""gaming"" chairs"
23-02-2018T00:47:14,SageSaga,the college i went to had a huge Sound Engineering course- they said anyone who walked in wearing beats was probably going to fail
23-02-2018T00:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre just obnoxious to me
23-02-2018T00:47:23,HeresyArtStream,lmao
23-02-2018T00:47:27,Unenlagia,hah
23-02-2018T00:47:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
23-02-2018T00:47:29,Ordithus,:fire:
23-02-2018T00:47:30,NezumiYuki,Pewdiepie~  But can your chair do this?!
23-02-2018T00:47:45,HeresyArtStream,Those gaming chairs don't even look comfortable.
23-02-2018T00:47:49,Unenlagia,"Yes, actually, and $200 cheaper!"
23-02-2018T00:47:56,HeresyArtStream,I will never buy a chair that I have not had the chance to sit in.
23-02-2018T00:47:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they are just bucket seats
23-02-2018T00:47:59,Dadrobit,"Same, anyone who comes into class here has to take them off and use one of our communal sets insted."
23-02-2018T00:48:13,Unenlagia,OR I go to Office Depot and sit on something myself.
23-02-2018T00:48:16,Dadrobit,instead*
23-02-2018T00:48:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I can just take the seat out of my car, and use that"
23-02-2018T00:48:44,unsteddyphoenix,Discrimination for justice
23-02-2018T00:49:10,Dadrobit,Gotta have #RealQuality
23-02-2018T00:49:13,HeresyArtStream,"My chair is pretty comfortable but the quality isn't that good, unfortunately. It creaks a lot, the staples are coming undone and the foam arm wrests started cracking years ago."
23-02-2018T00:49:17,unsteddyphoenix,agreed
23-02-2018T00:49:35,DrTec,Heresy use ducktape!
23-02-2018T00:49:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just throw a blanket over it heresy
23-02-2018T00:49:44,SageSaga,i spent a lot of money on my chair - its still in great condition
23-02-2018T00:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Why not both
23-02-2018T00:49:48,HeresyArtStream,I tried duct tape. It started melting and made everything sticky.
23-02-2018T00:49:55,TorqueEmUp,as for headphones I use TurtleBeach X42s with my consoles.
23-02-2018T00:49:57,NezumiYuki,Speaking of using car seats... or whole cars for that matter... that old discovery show.. Monster House... dat was some amusing stuff!   never thought of using car seats like that before.
23-02-2018T00:50:06,Beardozer,Those racecar gaming chairs are to stiff for my tastes.
23-02-2018T00:50:19,unsteddyphoenix,they go too fast
23-02-2018T00:50:33,Ordithus,Race cars are well known for being comfortable
23-02-2018T00:50:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"thats what DXracer chairs are, just bucket seats bolted onto a wheel base"
23-02-2018T00:50:45,HeresyArtStream,I like mesh chairs because they don't get sweaty.
23-02-2018T00:50:57,ZRO4825,I've never had a mesh chair...
23-02-2018T00:51:02,ZRO4825,Sounds kinda comfy :thinking:
23-02-2018T00:51:04,FluffKevlar,:cfluffkevlar-c6:
23-02-2018T00:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Mesh chairs make me feel like I‚Äôm about to fall through
23-02-2018T00:51:08,ZRO4825,Is it good for long hours at the computer?
23-02-2018T00:51:10,HeresyArtStream,flaffle!

23-02-2018T00:51:27,SageSaga,yes it is comfy for long period of time
23-02-2018T00:51:28,Bgrmystr2,Heya Fluff
23-02-2018T00:51:28,Ordithus,"The back is mesh usually, and a good one is super good"
23-02-2018T00:51:31,FluffKevlar,i like mesh chairs too
23-02-2018T00:51:32,unsteddyphoenix,He's on the ball
23-02-2018T00:51:38,TorqueEmUp,"I've always wanted to go to the junkyard, get a real nice seat from a a car for $50, and make a cheap office chair out of it."
23-02-2018T00:51:49,ZRO4825,"I'm 'bout due to replace this chair, maybe I should look into a mesh one this time."
23-02-2018T00:51:58,SageSaga,Fluff is a hipster with his standing desk
23-02-2018T00:52:02,FluffKevlar,haha
23-02-2018T00:52:07,HeresyArtStream,I think I paid like $150 for the mesh chair I currently have. I will probably have to go more expensive with my next one if I want better durability.
23-02-2018T00:52:09,FluffKevlar,i mean i still have to sit a lot
23-02-2018T00:52:12,FluffKevlar,cant stand ALL the time
23-02-2018T00:52:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"not gonna lie, a standing desk sounds nice"

23-02-2018T01:18:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,to save us from the aliens
23-02-2018T01:18:24,ZRO4825,I'd argue with Keith David.
23-02-2018T01:18:32,ZRO4825,Who the hell is Keith David? o_O
23-02-2018T01:18:34,Dadrobit,"A hole is not defined by it's being an opening/exiting though, it just /is/"
23-02-2018T01:18:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, is a fish in water actually wet, and is water itself wet?"
23-02-2018T01:18:48,Dadrobit,Super talented actor
23-02-2018T01:18:59,ZRO4825,"Okay, another name to forget, gotcha~"

23-02-2018T01:19:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Love him as Arbiter in halo
23-02-2018T01:20:10,Dadrobit,Never played Halo
23-02-2018T01:20:26,Dadrobit,Beyond the fist one
23-02-2018T01:20:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"1,2 and 3, odst, and reach are good ones"
23-02-2018T01:20:47,DarthRexKing,What brings up Keith David? :3
23-02-2018T01:20:53,Dadrobit,"First one was dank, 1v1 vs my brother, happy times"

23-02-2018T01:33:47,unsteddyphoenix,There are some dark things in those world...
23-02-2018T01:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a pregnancy craving hat someone posted
23-02-2018T01:36:17,ZRO4825,"...Sage! Random thought, we gonna get to Nyna's mama? D:"
23-02-2018T01:36:30,SageSaga,eventually yes

23-02-2018T01:36:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sweet :D
23-02-2018T01:37:18,Ordithus,Will Kaylin try to seduce her as well? :ptv-wondering:
23-02-2018T01:37:52,ZRO4825,"The real question is, is there a woman in this world Kaylin WOULDN'T try to seduce? :thinking:"
23-02-2018T01:37:55,SageSaga,if the story were a hentai totally- but its not- Kaylins not gonna start a Nekomata orgy
23-02-2018T01:38:15,ZRO4825,"Sage, that is almost disappointing to read."
23-02-2018T01:38:28,ZRO4825,"I'll survive, but you have broken my shortlived dreams."
23-02-2018T01:38:33,Ordithus,lol
23-02-2018T01:38:47,SageSaga,that's what doujinishi are for
23-02-2018T01:38:53,ZRO4825,True!
23-02-2018T01:39:23,Ordithus,Nyna's mom is just Kaylin's type though.  Female and breathing
23-02-2018T01:39:24,SageSaga,and when i finally give up on trying to make a living doing non-porn
23-02-2018T01:39:41,ZRO4825,D:
23-02-2018T01:39:56,unsteddyphoenix,When your will finally gets broken lol
23-02-2018T01:39:59,ZRO4825,Wait...can we get FLUFF to draw it? o_o
23-02-2018T01:40:21,SageSaga,he probably wouldnt out of respect for my work?
23-02-2018T01:40:27,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I figure, lol"
23-02-2018T01:40:31,ZRO4825,Cuz Fluff's awesome ^_^
23-02-2018T01:40:34,SageSaga,im sure you can find someone who doesnt respect me though to do it
23-02-2018T01:40:47,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but at that point, why would I trust them enough to do a good job of it?"
23-02-2018T01:41:13,SageSaga,there's plenty of great artists that dont care so long as they get paid XD
23-02-2018T01:41:33,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but I like the way you guys do stuff =D"
23-02-2018T01:41:44,ZRO4825,So what if I can't get porn of some characters? I'll live. ^_^
23-02-2018T01:42:01,unsteddyphoenix,Are you sure?
23-02-2018T01:42:03,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds risky...
23-02-2018T01:42:10,SageSaga,well if i cant start making enough to live off of in a year or two im probably not going to have a choice- new Taxes are gonna screw me
23-02-2018T01:42:20,ZRO4825,"ouch, that sucks to hear :("
23-02-2018T01:42:35,ZRO4825,:thinking: Think you can open another color slot a month? :P
23-02-2018T01:42:52,SageSaga,yeah probably
23-02-2018T01:42:58,ZRO4825,:o
23-02-2018T01:43:07,ZRO4825,was not expecting that answer honestly.
23-02-2018T01:43:56,SageSaga,considering i need the money and might have to just do more work- since i cant get enough people to just want to support my current work-
23-02-2018T01:44:23,ZRO4825,I'd gladly jump up to a color slot. And that'd free up a sketch slot~
23-02-2018T01:45:28,SageSaga,when you are ready message me on discord and i will open a slot for you to grab
23-02-2018T01:46:10,ZRO4825,"Just whenever you want, I'm good. =D"
23-02-2018T01:50:29,Ordithus,"I'm off to bed, good night, and thanks for streaming!"
23-02-2018T01:50:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ord
23-02-2018T01:50:40,TheBeckoner,Goodnight Ord
23-02-2018T01:58:14,aeoronwah,I can't sleep
23-02-2018T01:58:29,TheBeckoner,Arent you drunk?
23-02-2018T01:58:34,TheBeckoner,or something?
23-02-2018T01:58:56,aeoronwah,"Alcohol was a very bad idea, but at least I can spell now."
23-02-2018T01:59:30,SageSaga,funny thing is- this comic is just about to talk about alcohol XD
23-02-2018T01:59:39,ZRO4825,lol
23-02-2018T01:59:59,aeoronwah,"Sagex I don't know what I said earlier, but I apoligize on behalf of drunk me."
23-02-2018T02:00:11,Bgrmystr2,lolo
23-02-2018T02:00:20,SageSaga,np - the ban was only going to be temporary while you sobered up
23-02-2018T02:00:26,Bgrmystr2,Mainly you were talking about how severely drunk you were.
23-02-2018T02:00:35,Bgrmystr2,from what I saw
23-02-2018T02:01:01,aeoronwah,"I'm still not sober, I still had 7 ahots of bacardi at only 120 lbs"
23-02-2018T02:01:12,SageSaga,and asking us to get you to stop and when we told you to stop you told us to shut up
23-02-2018T02:01:25,Bgrmystr2,lol oh yeah
23-02-2018T02:01:28,Bgrmystr2,that happened too
23-02-2018T02:01:38,aeoronwah,Wow
23-02-2018T02:01:54,aeoronwah,"When I'm super drunk, I'm  an asshole I guess"
23-02-2018T02:01:58,aeoronwah,Lol
23-02-2018T02:02:12,KhaosMaster,hi hi
23-02-2018T02:02:17,SageSaga,yo
23-02-2018T02:02:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Khaos
23-02-2018T02:03:01,TheBeckoner,wo a
23-02-2018T02:05:04,KhaosMaster,"even tho i had an account here for a while now, im still not used to it. im on the other one more. :("
23-02-2018T02:05:54,SageSaga,is the other one for watching NSFW streams? XD
23-02-2018T02:06:05,KhaosMaster,no
23-02-2018T02:06:12,SageSaga,so why have 2?
23-02-2018T02:06:29,SageSaga,curious- you dont actually have to answer that
23-02-2018T02:07:02,KhaosMaster,im talking about the other streaming platform
23-02-2018T02:07:16,Bgrmystr2,there's probably dozens of streaming platforms
23-02-2018T02:07:18,SageSaga,which one? There are many
23-02-2018T02:07:23,Bgrmystr2,xD
23-02-2018T02:07:28,KhaosMaster,twitch
23-02-2018T02:08:09,SageSaga,I guess that would be the biggest and thus the most popular one
23-02-2018T02:08:25,SageSaga,but usually when people talk about a different account they mean on the same platform
23-02-2018T02:08:43,KhaosMaster,picarto is better imo because you can stream NSFW stuff without getting banned
23-02-2018T02:08:57,KhaosMaster,:D
23-02-2018T02:09:19,CheeseRS,Oh so that's why artist use Picarto that much?
23-02-2018T02:09:23,CheeseRS,Also hi
23-02-2018T02:09:29,SageSaga,i wonder if twitch would be against my gif-
23-02-2018T02:09:39,KhaosMaster,most likely
23-02-2018T02:09:44,CheeseRS,Yes it would
23-02-2018T02:09:53,SageSaga,and yeah- I have a lot of artist friends that do NSFW stuff so for me to stream with them - picarto is the only choice
23-02-2018T02:10:12,SageSaga,one of those artist did that gif for me XD
23-02-2018T02:10:33,KhaosMaster,i like the blue haired maid
23-02-2018T02:10:34,CheeseRS,Ok cool
23-02-2018T02:11:01,ZRO4825,Rem is best waifu.
23-02-2018T02:11:04,SageSaga,the blue haired maid is Rem from Re:Zero- she is Best girl...
23-02-2018T02:11:13,SageSaga,legit- she won best girl last year XD
23-02-2018T02:11:28,unsteddyphoenix,Undisputable
23-02-2018T02:11:29,CheeseRS,Bestest maid evah
23-02-2018T02:11:34,KhaosMaster,&lt;3
23-02-2018T02:11:49,TheBeckoner,woostuffandthings
23-02-2018T02:11:50,Bgrmystr2,"Not the perfect maid, of course."
23-02-2018T02:11:59,Bgrmystr2,So I can live with her having the 'best maid' title.
23-02-2018T02:12:08,CheeseRS,My perfect Maud would be Rose
23-02-2018T02:12:14,CheeseRS,Maid****
23-02-2018T02:12:16,ZRO4825,"And yeah, Sage, soon as I saw that gif, I knew that had to be a Maty work =D"
23-02-2018T02:12:52,ZRO4825,"Sage, random MH weapon for me to use, go~"
23-02-2018T02:13:00,KhaosMaster,its almost 1:15 a.m. i should sleep
23-02-2018T02:13:11,SageSaga,Gunlance was the first thing that came to mind Zro
23-02-2018T02:13:16,ZRO4825,Doin it
23-02-2018T02:13:17,CheeseRS,"Hehe, it's 9:13 AM here"
23-02-2018T02:13:23,SageSaga,specifically the Pink Rathian one
23-02-2018T02:13:30,ZRO4825,:thinking:
23-02-2018T02:13:34,ZRO4825,Do I have the parts for that one...
23-02-2018T02:13:37,Dadrobit,"Back, had to watch a short film real quick."
23-02-2018T02:13:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wb Dad
23-02-2018T02:14:00,ZRO4825,I am short Rathian Spike+  &gt;:(
23-02-2018T02:14:01,SageSaga,"i spent 600,000 zenny last night Zro"

23-02-2018T02:14:27,ZRO4825,jebus XD
23-02-2018T02:14:30,CheeseRS,What are you talking about?
23-02-2018T02:14:38,SageSaga,Monster Hunter World
23-02-2018T02:14:43,ZRO4825,"I'm finally getting to the point where I can do enough missions without needing to upgrade anything to start actually MAKING zenny, lol"
23-02-2018T02:15:01,CheeseRS,"Oh, the game that I can't play because I don't have a console? Yeah cool"
23-02-2018T02:15:02,SageSaga,get your bandit mantle?
23-02-2018T02:15:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,isn't zenny also dragon ball currency?
23-02-2018T02:15:24,SageSaga,Cheese- i understand... i bought a PS4 so i could play- i still plan to get it for PC XD
23-02-2018T02:15:38,ZRO4825,Nope. Didn't know it existed. Been kinda busy just trying to get my tempered investigations up to self-sustaining point.
23-02-2018T02:15:43,CheeseRS,Wait can you play it on PC too?
23-02-2018T02:15:43,SageSaga,Zenny is a common fantasy currency often used in JRPGs
23-02-2018T02:15:49,TheBeckoner,I'm waiting for PC since I wont actually play console lol
23-02-2018T02:15:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oh
23-02-2018T02:15:52,ZRO4825,"Yeah, Capcom's fond of Zenny a lot"
23-02-2018T02:16:02,SageSaga,PC release in Fall of this year
23-02-2018T02:16:18,CheeseRS,"Well even if it comes to PC, I wouldn't be able to play it"
23-02-2018T02:16:26,TheBeckoner,Yuuuup probably worth the wait. we'll see.
23-02-2018T02:16:48,SageSaga,Zro- get the bandit mantle NOW - seriously- its a 5 star optional quest called Redefining the Power Couple
23-02-2018T02:17:08,Dadrobit,"Was about to say it was the currency in KH, but that's Munny"
23-02-2018T02:17:28,ZRO4825,"Oh, is it that quest? Huh, we just did that as a group earlier"
23-02-2018T02:17:59,SageSaga,if you did and beat it you need to talk to the armory woman
23-02-2018T02:18:05,Dadrobit,Bandit Mantle with the Heavy Bow Gun special is CRAZY GOOd
23-02-2018T02:18:07,Dadrobit,D
23-02-2018T02:18:08,SageSaga,she will give you the mantle
23-02-2018T02:18:18,SageSaga,hammer is great too
23-02-2018T02:19:41,ZRO4825,"Oh damn. Yeah, I can see why you would like this. Faster weapons better with it, or 'bout even, or no?"
23-02-2018T02:20:11,SageSaga,it is balanced for all weapons but even so- more hits or staggers is usually what causes it
23-02-2018T02:20:23,SageSaga,"so Hammer, Dualblades, Rapid fire on a gun-"
23-02-2018T02:20:35,SageSaga,SnS is good too since its fast
23-02-2018T02:20:58,ZRO4825,"Oh sweet, Gunlance works well with my armor setup for CB too."
23-02-2018T02:21:03,ZRO4825,Artillery and Capacity &lt;3
23-02-2018T02:21:13,CheeseRS,Wait... TwoKinds and SageSaga have the same channel??
23-02-2018T02:21:24,ZRO4825,"Well, they do when they decide to stream together"
23-02-2018T02:21:33,SageSaga,we are multistreamed
23-02-2018T02:21:38,CheeseRS,Oh
23-02-2018T02:21:41,Dadrobit,They're merged temporarily
23-02-2018T02:21:53,SageSaga,Toms a good friend of mine for the past... 14 years?
23-02-2018T02:21:56,TheBeckoner,Like catdog
23-02-2018T02:21:57,CheeseRS,Well then... Fine by me
23-02-2018T02:22:11,CheeseRS,Like when he started the comic?

23-02-2018T02:23:47,ZRO4825,"First quarter of the old one is kinda rough, but once you get into the newer stuff Yosh gets good =D"
23-02-2018T02:23:58,CheeseRS,"Can you tell me the page count, to see how much time I'm going to put into it?"
23-02-2018T02:23:59,ZRO4825,But it's kinda huge ^_^
23-02-2018T02:24:06,ZRO4825,"...over 2000 now, isn't it?"

23-02-2018T02:28:15,SageSaga,he actually did 2 pictures of her-
23-02-2018T02:28:23,ZRO4825,:thinking:
23-02-2018T02:28:37,CheeseRS,"Is Picarto the place where I can find you, Tom and Fluff streaming?"
23-02-2018T02:28:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes

23-02-2018T02:32:29,CheeseRS,Yeah?
23-02-2018T02:32:36,CheeseRS,How does that work?
23-02-2018T02:32:45,SageSaga,https://twitter.com/fluffkevlar/status/965074348523577351
23-02-2018T02:33:07,CheeseRS,Another app crash incoming because Android... BRB
23-02-2018T02:33:29,unsteddyphoenix,But have you killed all the giants

23-02-2018T02:34:12,SageSaga,now we are doing Star Trek Super Heroes
23-02-2018T02:35:11,unsteddyphoenix,Hoo~ whos the Vulcan?
23-02-2018T02:35:43,SageSaga,and Fluff seems upset because Mihari created a near invulnerable super strong flying girl while hes an old doctor with no skills in doctor
23-02-2018T02:36:16,ZRO4825,:joy:
23-02-2018T02:36:53,unsteddyphoenix,Dang power gamers
23-02-2018T02:37:08,SageSaga,it's a super hero game
23-02-2018T02:37:44,SageSaga,its the difference between a person who knows exactly what they want to do and be- and someone who did it last minute
23-02-2018T02:38:15,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha aww
23-02-2018T02:39:26,SageSaga,Fluff has some cool powers- he just has no idea how they work or how to use them XD
23-02-2018T02:39:50,CheeseRS,"Back, checked Fluff's IKEA adventure."
23-02-2018T02:40:28,SageSaga,that man loves furniture
23-02-2018T02:40:33,Bgrmystr2,xD
23-02-2018T02:40:35,SageSaga,he should have created the Sofa King
23-02-2018T02:40:37,CheeseRS,Yes he does
23-02-2018T02:40:47,SageSaga,but Sofa King is a villain...
23-02-2018T02:40:47,unsteddyphoenix,All the more to move with
23-02-2018T02:41:03,unsteddyphoenix,Nut king is a hero of justice
23-02-2018T02:41:06,CheeseRS,Kill the sofa king
23-02-2018T02:41:38,SageSaga,"the Sofa King has world ending tier telekinetic powers, but they only function on furniture"
23-02-2018T02:41:38,Bgrmystr2,So.. Fluff would end up an amalgamation of the two and become the Sofa Nut?
23-02-2018T02:41:41,Bgrmystr2,:v
23-02-2018T02:41:50,CheeseRS,Oh
23-02-2018T02:42:10,CheeseRS,Nut on Sofa

23-02-2018T02:42:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"clean the sofa first, jeez"
23-02-2018T02:42:46,SageSaga,"""Could the Sofa King beat Phoenix from the X-men?"" ""Is there an IKEA nearby?"" ""Yes?"" ""Then yes- easily"""
23-02-2018T02:42:51,CheeseRS,I don't have any napkins...
23-02-2018T02:43:06,CheeseRS,^^^
23-02-2018T02:43:26,Dadrobit,":) I rather fondly remember typing thinks like ""I am sofa King we tall dead"" into my grandaddy's old Macintosh's text to speech some 20 years back..."

23-02-2018T02:46:36,ZRO4825,"-mimis are love, -mimis are life &lt;3"
23-02-2018T02:47:03,CheeseRS,Say that to him. He has a literal fetish for them.

23-02-2018T02:47:32,CheeseRS,I'm more of either full furry or gtfo
23-02-2018T02:48:03,CheeseRS,So Tom's work appeases me more than this.

23-02-2018T02:49:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats how I art
23-02-2018T02:50:44,SageSaga,we went over this before-
23-02-2018T02:51:02,SageSaga,ctrl z is only useful if you know you made a mistake or can do it better
23-02-2018T02:52:59,CheeseRS,Nice blush
23-02-2018T02:54:41,TheBeckoner,I legitimately got enough chips and salsa for a medium sized 3 person family.
23-02-2018T02:55:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds like you need more
23-02-2018T02:55:08,CheeseRS,"Tell me your address, I'm coming to eat"
23-02-2018T02:55:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats not enough for me

23-02-2018T02:55:29,CheeseRS,I am a real fomist
23-02-2018T02:55:43,CheeseRS,It's a word in my language
23-02-2018T02:55:48,TheBeckoner,Maybe I'll get stuck in that loop where you run out of chips or out of salsa but never both.
23-02-2018T02:55:55,CheeseRS,It means I can't ever eat enough
23-02-2018T02:56:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Well Mark just went live

23-02-2018T03:10:19,Bgrmystr2,"I would say one can never eat too many chips, but I literally did that 10 years ago."

23-02-2018T03:12:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I like me some chips and salsa but my favorite thing‚Äôs gotta be cheesecake

23-02-2018T03:27:38,TheBeckoner,Didnt know it was a thing
23-02-2018T03:27:51,SageSaga,it's about as good as you would expect- a poor attempt at bringing some of the most iconic parts of the story to live action- failing horribly - realizing they dont actually have time to do the entire story in one movie- and doing something just awful to
23-02-2018T03:27:55,SageSaga,finish it as fast as possible
23-02-2018T03:28:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so another death note movie?
23-02-2018T03:28:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,great

23-02-2018T03:32:05,unsteddyphoenix,So lazy :/
23-02-2018T03:32:20,SageSaga,it's practically a collection of some of the most famous scenes mashed together as much as possible
23-02-2018T03:32:45,CheeseRS,"Alright, so it's awful"
23-02-2018T03:32:45,SageSaga,"and then a poorly written ""We dont have a 6 hour run time! Quick! Make something up!"""

23-02-2018T10:43:13,Nekonny,I'm at a point that I dont think theres a definition for lewd
23-02-2018T10:43:44,Nekonny,"is this crude and offensive in a sexual way."""" ?"
23-02-2018T10:44:01,Crawford,shrugs
23-02-2018T10:44:21,Mislakane,:thinking:
23-02-2018T10:44:29,Piittis,Depends on the person looking at it I guess.
23-02-2018T10:44:43,Crawford,thats a good point
23-02-2018T10:45:21,Nekonny,"then that makes it a nonsense word that applies to anything, depending on your point of view ^^"""
23-02-2018T10:45:50,Crawford,making coffee is now lewd XD
23-02-2018T10:46:47,Crawford,XD
23-02-2018T10:47:50,Nekonny,gonna separate the rest of these pages out before I make a horribel mistake
23-02-2018T10:47:56,Nekonny,brb
23-02-2018T10:48:44,Mislakane,:ptv-shock:
23-02-2018T10:50:35,Nekonny,there we go
23-02-2018T10:51:20,Crawford,also remember to save
23-02-2018T10:51:50,Nekonny,don't you start now XD
23-02-2018T10:51:59,Piittis,Yea you propably dont want to lose all this progress
23-02-2018T10:52:16,Nekonny,dont worry about me with that
23-02-2018T10:52:30,Nekonny,its a habit of mine to save evry time I complete an area
23-02-2018T10:54:00,Mislakane,good idea
23-02-2018T10:56:40,Nekonny,I wonder if I should open up for preorders on these books
23-02-2018T10:56:50,Nekonny,"or rather, prints"
23-02-2018T10:57:01,Nekonny,I only have enough to print so many for the con
23-02-2018T10:57:08,Nekonny,and they come inbatches of 25
23-02-2018T10:59:14,sunblaze,print only? or do you plan to make an e-book as well?
23-02-2018T10:59:19,Nekonny,if there even is interest in any of it
23-02-2018T10:59:35,Nekonny,"yeah, I was thinking g perhaps an ebook"
23-02-2018T10:59:40,Nekonny,it would be two stories
23-02-2018T10:59:41,sunblaze,I'd be since we both know the shippingcosts to germany....
23-02-2018T10:59:57,Nekonny,this one and another featuring nchan and kimi
23-02-2018T11:00:10,sunblaze,go kimi go!
23-02-2018T11:00:17,Nekonny,"yeah, euroupe is my second largest market but shipping is a killer"
23-02-2018T11:03:18,Nekonny,"last time I had to pay, it cost over 4 times the production materials"
23-02-2018T11:03:50,Crawford,might have to adjust your pricing for different areas
23-02-2018T11:03:50,Piittis,That's quite a lot
23-02-2018T11:04:20,Mislakane,need someone there to make the stuff
23-02-2018T11:05:29,Crawford,"altho thinking back on that stament i made, i've seen uk magazines printed here in canada that cost double"
23-02-2018T11:05:47,Crawford,yah imaginefx i'm looking at you
23-02-2018T11:09:19,sunblaze,the problem is not even rons prices but I wanted like 3 of his hardcover books
23-02-2018T11:09:27,sunblaze,price around 60-70 bucks
23-02-2018T11:09:32,sunblaze,shipping was 70 as welll
23-02-2018T11:09:40,sunblaze,that kinda blows customers off
23-02-2018T11:10:11,Crawford,if you really want it you gotta pay
23-02-2018T11:10:13,Nekonny,canada is also super expensive for some reason :/
23-02-2018T11:10:35,Nekonny,I only have one hardcover ^^ '
23-02-2018T11:10:49,Crawford,"tell me about it, same stuff in the staes is cheaper than what i can get here"
23-02-2018T11:10:54,Crawford,states
23-02-2018T11:10:59,sunblaze,it was several books at least mabe just one hardcover but the oders as regular
23-02-2018T11:11:10,sunblaze,still shipping was the same price as the actual bill
23-02-2018T11:13:45,Crawford,"yah tell me about it, bought a game off of the gamestop web site, almost $25 for the damn thing"
23-02-2018T11:14:54,Nekonny,"In the end, I had to ship all my european books together in a single box, then have a friend in germany ship them from there"
23-02-2018T11:15:13,Crawford,"sounds like a plan, hope it works out"
23-02-2018T11:15:23,Nekonny,it did
23-02-2018T11:15:50,Nekonny,ended up being about half if I remember correctly
23-02-2018T11:15:59,Nekonny,"still expensive, but not nearly as much"
23-02-2018T11:16:26,Crawford,well thats good to hear

23-02-2018T11:52:42,Crawford,the fun never stops when you get a warm day and almost everything melts and then flash freeze over night then snow on top of that
23-02-2018T11:56:49,TheBeckoner,"I figure I'll live for atleast another 60 maybe 70 years, So I also figure I can do nothing now since nice outdoor conditions will eventually occur again."

23-02-2018T16:18:21,Bgrmystr2,Should probably yell at phoenix. It's probably his fault your download is unsteddy

23-02-2018T16:32:01,eric190,"tom streams friday, sunday, sometime midweek."

23-02-2018T16:34:26,CheeseRS,Not even on iOS
23-02-2018T16:34:33,Bgrmystr2,"I'm saying the problem is you're using a phone, and not a computer lol"
23-02-2018T16:34:39,CheeseRS,Yes
23-02-2018T16:35:01,CheeseRS,But my phone is private at least.
23-02-2018T16:35:12,CheeseRS,Can't let Mom know I'm a furry
23-02-2018T16:35:19,Bgrmystr2,xD
23-02-2018T16:35:27,CheeseRS,She'd just kick me out of the house.
23-02-2018T16:35:53,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a very not-nice individual
23-02-2018T16:36:06,CheeseRS,You are not wrong there
23-02-2018T16:37:40,CheeseRS,"Well, she is nice. But she isn't fond of furries. Or any fandom at all besides Facebook groups"
23-02-2018T16:38:29,TheBeckoner,"""Facebook fandom"" - I wonder what their conventions are like..."
23-02-2018T16:38:43,CheeseRS,You don't want to know
23-02-2018T16:40:02,CheeseRS,"Every Facebook group is a fandom of its own. Either a like for like, or *insert nationality* in *insert country*, or even marketplace groups, to sell/buy/trade stuff"
23-02-2018T16:40:24,CheeseRS,I'd burn Facebook if I could...
23-02-2018T16:41:00,Bgrmystr2,"you and a lot of others, cheese"

23-02-2018T16:43:51,Bgrmystr2,"I just think if you petition it, ppl will oppose that, and it turns into a mess"
23-02-2018T16:43:57,Bgrmystr2,"just burn the thing, gets it done and over with."

23-02-2018T16:46:47,CheeseRS,"No problem. Hey Sage, are you still alive?"
23-02-2018T16:46:51,Bgrmystr2,cuz sometimes the emojis fly

23-02-2018T16:47:07,CheeseRS,Hey!
23-02-2018T16:47:46,Rosscoe,Notice here saying he made a recording
23-02-2018T16:47:57,Rosscoe,unless hes done and left stream up by accident XD
23-02-2018T16:48:13,Bgrmystr2,"naw, that means his connection is having issue"
23-02-2018T16:48:20,Bgrmystr2,cuz the website things he stopped streaming
23-02-2018T16:48:30,Bgrmystr2,which is why the recording was created
23-02-2018T16:48:37,Bgrmystr2,but it was just a hiccup of the line
23-02-2018T16:48:39,CheeseRS,"Just wait, he'll come back"
23-02-2018T16:48:44,Bgrmystr2,so his stream didn't stop
23-02-2018T16:48:56,KGH786,i don't think so
23-02-2018T16:48:59,Bgrmystr2,so now the recording is broken xD cuz it won't record the rest of the stream
23-02-2018T16:49:01,CheeseRS,Spam too much?

23-02-2018T16:54:37,CheeseRS,Done with the troubleshooting?
23-02-2018T16:54:39,Bgrmystr2,your net hiccup'd while you were gone and made a recording
23-02-2018T16:54:52,Bgrmystr2,so the rest of the stream won't be recorded :u
23-02-2018T16:55:36,CheeseRS,Are you the one who records livestream and uploads them to YouTube?
23-02-2018T16:55:52,SageSaga,no
23-02-2018T16:56:15,CheeseRS,Actually I was talking to bgr
23-02-2018T16:56:37,CheeseRS,Mlem
23-02-2018T16:56:39,Bgrmystr2,"if you're talking about tom's streams, that's iliar"
23-02-2018T16:57:12,CheeseRS,Is he known around here?
23-02-2018T16:57:20,Bgrmystr2,generally yeah
23-02-2018T16:57:34,CheeseRS,Alright
23-02-2018T16:57:46,Bgrmystr2,"he's not super common, but shows his face every once in a while"
23-02-2018T16:58:01,CheeseRS,Got it
23-02-2018T16:58:16,Bgrmystr2,"used to be a regular if I recall correctly, but I guess things happened so he can't come to the streams as often"
23-02-2018T16:59:11,CheeseRS,Yet he still uploads every one of Tom's streams on YouTube
23-02-2018T16:59:22,CheeseRS,"Anyway, got my popcorn"
23-02-2018T17:00:19,Bgrmystr2,It's a script he wrote
23-02-2018T17:00:23,Bgrmystr2,does it automatically
23-02-2018T17:00:29,Bgrmystr2,unless something bad happens
23-02-2018T17:00:39,CheeseRS,Oh
23-02-2018T17:01:16,iliar,At this time something went wrong. So I upload video manually.
