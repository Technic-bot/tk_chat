30-04-2018T01:48:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“Which one?”
30-04-2018T01:49:02,SpazztasticKiwi,“‘Nair’ is what it said”
30-04-2018T01:49:07,SpazztasticKiwi,“Uh oh”
30-04-2018T01:49:09,Dadrobit,Oof
30-04-2018T01:50:10,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
30-04-2018T01:51:43,Dadrobit,Question. Beasts are second class citizens right? Will a lack of literacy be an issue? Coucld cause some interesting interactions I would think.
30-04-2018T01:52:14,Bgrmystr2,"not gonna lie, I don't get the reference, Kiwi"
30-04-2018T01:52:17,Twokinds,"Yeah, might."
30-04-2018T01:52:30,Twokinds,I had some ideas about her being a writer of some sort.
30-04-2018T01:52:37,Twokinds,Could be some possibilities with that.
30-04-2018T01:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Nair is a hair removal cream. It’s been mistakenly used as shampoo sometimes
30-04-2018T01:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people don’t read the bottle
30-04-2018T01:58:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Colin finds Sam’s diary. Asks her to read him the “new book”
30-04-2018T02:04:42,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: oh holy shit xD
30-04-2018T02:05:49,DarthRexKing,Morons. I hope it is permanent as punishment.
30-04-2018T02:09:09,Twokinds,Colin can't even speak human so it doesn't matter much/
30-04-2018T02:12:31,Dadrobit,"Wow, you're kind of a cunt aren't ya, Darth?"
30-04-2018T02:12:53,Dadrobit,"Ah, was wondering if there was a language barrier."
30-04-2018T02:14:45,BadFoMo,What are we talking about?
30-04-2018T02:15:53,Dadrobit,The comic with Sam and Colin that's on the backburner atm.
30-04-2018T02:23:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw. Colin tries to set up a little picnic date for them to be sweet
30-04-2018T02:23:20,SpazztasticKiwi,That’d be cute
30-04-2018T02:41:42,DarthRexKing,cunt?
30-04-2018T03:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m going on to bed before I regret it tomorrow
30-04-2018T03:04:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom - night chat
30-04-2018T03:09:42,DarthRexKing,Me too. Later.
30-04-2018T03:21:12,SiliconCarbide,huh seems like one of the nora card holders dropped their patreon support
30-04-2018T03:30:31,Dadrobit,"Awww, Darth left, I wanted to go into depth about exactly why he was a cunt..."
30-04-2018T03:31:32,Dadrobit,"Also, shame on me for taking a nap today. Now I'm wired at 1:30 in the morning..."
30-04-2018T03:32:50,Dadrobit,"And by nap, I mean sleep for a solid 4-ish hours..."
30-04-2018T06:07:30,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo did I miss some lore stuff?
30-04-2018T06:07:39,unsteddyphoenix,Also Endless Battle was really good
30-04-2018T06:10:22,unsteddyphoenix,I regret not seeing black panther beforehand now
30-04-2018T06:11:44,SiliconCarbide,so you would advise to see black panther before infinity war? thats good to know
30-04-2018T06:22:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah. Maybe doctor strange too, or a plot summary at least"
30-04-2018T07:37:53,SiliconCarbide,"thansk for the headsup, i was pondering watching it, but i havent seen those other 2"
30-04-2018T07:38:02,SiliconCarbide,and probably wont until i finish my thesis
30-04-2018T07:38:15,SiliconCarbide,so ill probably put off infinity war as well
30-04-2018T07:38:17,SiliconCarbide,for now
30-04-2018T08:30:22,unsteddyphoenix,Good luck avoiding spoilers
30-04-2018T08:30:32,unsteddyphoenix,I cant imagine good manners will hold out for much longer
30-04-2018T08:30:37,unsteddyphoenix,not with this one
30-04-2018T09:54:03,SiliconCarbide,"ha yeah thats gonna be tricky, ill try my luck though :)"
30-04-2018T13:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,This guy just said I look 15
30-04-2018T14:11:42,Twokinds,Do you look 15?
30-04-2018T14:12:30,totallynotTrace,"huh, did @twokinds reduce the number of Nora cards? it says 3 patrons and sold out"
30-04-2018T14:12:42,totallynotTrace,also hi again guys
30-04-2018T14:14:46,totallynotTrace,he does have a good point. Do you look/feel/want to look 15?
30-04-2018T14:25:19,Dadrobit,Maybe because one slot was already done for the month he just closed it?
30-04-2018T14:28:15,TheBeckoner,Hello hello
30-04-2018T14:28:24,totallynotTrace,"I dont really know how the counter works, I just know that it typicaly says 4 so I was curious"
30-04-2018T14:28:28,totallynotTrace,hi beck
30-04-2018T14:28:48,TheBeckoner,"Dude next to me in Trig: ""I think I did pretty well on this last test"""

30-04-2018T14:29:40,TheBeckoner,It's good to be good.
30-04-2018T14:30:38,SiliconCarbide,"the monthly amount of dollars also went down by 200, maybe someone just ended their patreon support"
30-04-2018T14:31:04,totallynotTrace,considering how close i came to doin very bad ill take doin very well
30-04-2018T14:32:12,MisterWho,"well, the term ""pretty well"" for me was a good buffer to ""fail"". ;)"
30-04-2018T14:32:54,MisterWho,Especially in mathematics III at my university
30-04-2018T14:33:38,totallynotTrace,so your doin good or do you feel like your doin good even though numbers say otherwise?
30-04-2018T14:36:56,MisterWho,"More the feeling, real doing good would've been learning more and not getting into a panic 48hours before a test. XD"
30-04-2018T14:37:13,totallynotTrace,ah
30-04-2018T14:37:42,totallynotTrace,i got lucky and didnt get mauled by a bear
30-04-2018T14:38:09,SiliconCarbide,well if thats lucky for you i dont want to know what a bad day looks like
30-04-2018T14:38:11,totallynotTrace,I think im doin pretty good
30-04-2018T14:38:28,totallynotTrace,a bad day is getting mauled
30-04-2018T14:38:32,MisterWho,"The best ""doing good"" i ever saw one student taking a test with 39°C fever and with &gt;80% (top 10)"
30-04-2018T14:38:36,totallynotTrace,XD
30-04-2018T14:38:44,totallynotTrace,what
30-04-2018T14:39:02,totallynotTrace,hold on let me double check that conversion
30-04-2018T14:39:07,MisterWho,it was his 3rd try and the last test in the semester.
30-04-2018T14:39:39,totallynotTrace,dam thats a high fever
30-04-2018T14:39:54,MisterWho,1h test - and he did it.
30-04-2018T14:40:08,MisterWho,He was real dripping and we're WTF
30-04-2018T14:40:27,totallynotTrace,hopefully he didnt get anyone else sick
30-04-2018T14:40:52,MisterWho,don't remember if he bombed the others in that room - i got out healthy
30-04-2018T14:41:17,totallynotTrace,thats good
30-04-2018T14:50:15,Twokinds,"Whenever someone drops out of the Nora Card tier, I lower the amount until after the 1st of the month"
30-04-2018T14:50:36,Twokinds,So no one tries to get in on April 30 and get double charged.
30-04-2018T14:56:46,totallynotTrace,ah
30-04-2018T14:56:46,MisterWho,That would be...expensive indeed. O.o
30-04-2018T14:58:48,totallynotTrace,so i just found a video and i havnt laughed at anything so hard in years. but what is said and the text is slightly nsfw so i wont post the youtube link withought someone saying to post it
30-04-2018T14:59:14,totallynotTrace,its people reading failed inspirobot quotes
30-04-2018T15:02:10,MisterWho,Ouch ouchouchouch XD OMG

30-04-2018T15:20:41,totallynotTrace,i have to leave now
30-04-2018T15:20:45,totallynotTrace,see ya guys
30-04-2018T16:18:05,SpazztasticKiwi,We just went to see Rampage
30-04-2018T16:43:47,Twokinds,Rampage? Is that a movie?
30-04-2018T16:45:49,DRAGONTANOPUG,New one
30-04-2018T16:45:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yes
30-04-2018T16:47:43,BadFoMo,Based on the arcade game?
30-04-2018T16:55:15,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like King Kong
30-04-2018T16:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,But on steroids
30-04-2018T16:57:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m currently in a Belk store. About to swap over to Victoria’s Secret and Ulta
30-04-2018T16:59:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Never been in any of them before
30-04-2018T17:17:00,DRAGONTANOPUG,My mom just asked me if i had friends... i said yes ....... but really meant no
30-04-2018T17:26:20,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Rampage was based off of a couple old arcade machines where you controlled giant monsters to destroy big buildings."
30-04-2018T17:26:46,Dadrobit,"Later iterations also either incuded, or focused on combat between the giant monsters."
30-04-2018T17:27:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,Look! I drew this with the basitin christmas image. https://youtu.be/nQ6kcW7Dx60
30-04-2018T17:27:26,Dadrobit,The movie has both and stars Dwayne Johnson.
30-04-2018T17:28:26,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or THE ROCK!
30-04-2018T17:28:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And Jeffery Dean Morgan
30-04-2018T17:28:37,DRAGONTANOPUG,Whonow
30-04-2018T17:29:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Negan
30-04-2018T17:29:28,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh hes in the walkin dead
30-04-2018T17:29:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t watch the Walking Dead nor do I care for it but I do like Jeffery’s acting
30-04-2018T17:29:59,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he was definitely solid in that."
30-04-2018T17:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember why I don’t wear makeup much anymore
30-04-2018T17:30:34,Dadrobit,"Oh, and don't bring your kids. That movie did not shy away from violenec."
30-04-2018T17:30:40,Dadrobit,violence*
30-04-2018T17:31:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ill fuckin watch it!
30-04-2018T17:39:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I want pizza but I can’t finish one on my own
30-04-2018T17:39:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,:ptv-kippi2:
30-04-2018T17:39:34,Vatruvius,"Yes, I am getting my computer back at 5:30 pm pacific tonight!"
30-04-2018T17:39:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,Why!?
30-04-2018T17:40:38,Vatruvius,"Keyboard was brocken on my laptop, had to get it repaired. UPS said I could drop by at 5:30 to puck it up."
30-04-2018T17:40:51,Vatruvius,pick*
30-04-2018T17:41:03,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ah.
30-04-2018T17:41:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a laptop whose keyboard was dying
30-04-2018T17:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,It was perpetually stuck typing “wwwwwwww”
30-04-2018T17:42:35,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hah now whos the master race... moblie
30-04-2018T17:43:20,Bgrmystr2,mobile is still trash :v
30-04-2018T17:43:26,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ok
30-04-2018T17:43:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,=/
30-04-2018T17:44:16,Bgrmystr2,"and lol, that's not a keyboard dying, that's just a key stuck. Not really that hard to get it un-stuck"
30-04-2018T17:44:55,Vatruvius,"Yeah, there is a reason why there is a PC Master Race and not a mobike or console one."
30-04-2018T17:44:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell that to the Best Buy “expert”
30-04-2018T17:45:19,Vatruvius,mobile*
30-04-2018T17:47:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"I didn’t believe the guy’s diagnosis really, but I didn’t like that laptop much anyway"
30-04-2018T17:49:25,Vatruvius,My laptop os under warranty so I just sent it back to get the keyboard fixed. Some keys were unresponsive is all. Those keys just happened to be the crouch button in most games...
30-04-2018T17:49:31,Vatruvius,is*
30-04-2018T17:50:11,SpazztasticKiwi,The warranty was already out. I’m sure someone with a better knack for computers could snap it out of its fit but I’ve got a new one now that I love better
30-04-2018T17:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I find someone who wants it and can fix it, I’d probably let them have it"
30-04-2018T17:52:01,Bgrmystr2,I've never met anyone who works at Best Buy who knows a damn thing about computers
30-04-2018T17:52:19,Bgrmystr2,and there's lots of things online that catch Best Buy scamming people who don't know any better
30-04-2018T17:53:44,SpazztasticKiwi,They wanted to take the laptop for a few days (about a week really) to get it fixed. It was gonna be a about $100 or so
30-04-2018T17:53:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not that gullible
30-04-2018T17:54:33,SpazztasticKiwi,And I needed something for school work then. Couldn’t be without
30-04-2018T17:56:04,Bgrmystr2,"well, it depends. $20-40 for the keyboard replacement, $5~ for shipping and the rest is basically paying them for their ""work"""
30-04-2018T17:56:24,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes it's more difficult though, some keyboards cost more"
30-04-2018T17:56:43,Bgrmystr2,"lotta times, keys sticking or not responding very well is just a membrane replacement"
30-04-2018T17:56:57,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's where the connections and buttons actually are.
30-04-2018T17:57:03,Bgrmystr2,and those aren't super expensive.
30-04-2018T17:58:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I know that much at least. Got a friend that opened a computer shop with his boyfriend
30-04-2018T17:58:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I need anything, I’m gonna start going to them - they’re closer and I know them.And I’ve learned stuff with time"
30-04-2018T18:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d also like to mention I had the fun of watching the car in front of us drive at least a mile with their left blinker on
30-04-2018T18:29:53,Vatruvius,What?
30-04-2018T18:30:02,Vatruvius,Why?
30-04-2018T18:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure they left it on and didn’t notice
30-04-2018T18:53:29,Vatruvius,Noooo! I caught up with all my missed youtube videos. I got nothing to watch and I have to kill another 40 minutes until I get my computer to play games! :ptv-pouty:
30-04-2018T18:57:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m 12 videos behind with Jack and 6 behind with Mark
30-04-2018T18:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Some of the videos I’ve been watching lately haven’t been showing in notifications
30-04-2018T19:01:19,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im all caught up with vanoss and pewdewpie
30-04-2018T19:01:48,Vatruvius,"With my computer being gone, I have really been catching up. Many videos every day."
30-04-2018T19:02:08,MisterWho,"Strange, normally a blinker is very loud - has to be."
30-04-2018T19:03:16,Vatruvius,"I have 12 subscriptions, 10 of which make regular to daily videos."
30-04-2018T19:04:48,MisterWho,That's a mission impossilbe for me - if have ATM....128 subscriptions on YT.
30-04-2018T19:04:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m subed to 31. Mainly watch Jack and Mark
30-04-2018T19:04:57,MisterWho,"Just my ""best"" YT channels."
30-04-2018T19:05:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Though lately I’ve favored hanging here - hence why I’m so behind
30-04-2018T19:05:37,MisterWho,priorities ;)
30-04-2018T19:06:07,SpazztasticKiwi,That and Mark has the upload consistency of an earthquake
30-04-2018T19:07:03,Vatruvius,"I use to have a lot of subscriptions years ago, but it just got out of hand. I decided to do some major trimming to just the people I keep coming back or always watching their videos."
30-04-2018T19:07:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"His longer videos has caused the watch time record to go up on his channel. It used to be that Jack was shown as my most watched, with Mark behind. But Mark’s gained the top spot now"
30-04-2018T19:07:26,Vatruvius,He has been pretty consistent of late Kiwi.
30-04-2018T19:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s been downright bubbly lately
30-04-2018T19:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Even mentioned getting another dog a month or so ago
30-04-2018T19:08:31,Vatruvius,"His long videos is a love, hate thing with me. I can deal with tgem being longer but if tye video is over an hour long I get annoyed."
30-04-2018T19:08:42,Vatruvius,Really?
30-04-2018T19:09:25,Vatruvius,Things must be going good. He is in a relationship with what's-her-name right? Seems like it anyway.
30-04-2018T19:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if he will though. He said he was thinking about doing a home video series when he visited
30-04-2018T19:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,That didn’t happen either. And her name’s Amy
30-04-2018T19:10:11,Vatruvius,"Yes, knew it started with an A."
30-04-2018T19:11:01,Vatruvius,"It appears to me he has to be in some sort of relationship, that or is surrounding himself with more positive friends."
30-04-2018T19:11:24,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s been dating her for awhile now as far as I know
30-04-2018T19:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s so pretty I could cry
30-04-2018T19:11:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,OMFG PROP IS NOW ON BLACK OPS THREE:ptv-excited:
30-04-2018T19:12:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,Prop hunt*
30-04-2018T19:16:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m debating spending $64 on a split end hair wand
30-04-2018T19:16:17,Vatruvius,"I would say a few dates constitutes a relationship but it could still be unofficial. As far as his popularity, I would want to keep it on the down low because all of Mark's would ship them as a married couple if tgey declared an ""official"" relationship."
30-04-2018T19:16:53,Vatruvius,Would ot not be better to trim the split hairs?
30-04-2018T19:17:14,Vatruvius,Mark's fans*
30-04-2018T19:17:23,Vatruvius,they*
30-04-2018T19:17:35,Vatruvius,OMG it*
30-04-2018T19:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I can make a one time purchase and have something that’ll trim for me whenever I need or I can do regular trips to a salon
30-04-2018T19:18:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Going in for a trim can cost $20 per trip
30-04-2018T19:19:08,Vatruvius,"One time purchase sounds like the best option, but my mom and sister like having their hair taken care of for them so...I do not know. Up to you."
30-04-2018T19:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,But $64...
30-04-2018T19:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s expensive
30-04-2018T19:19:51,Vatruvius,That is three months of trims though...
30-04-2018T19:20:15,Vatruvius,Three months or is it longer? Shorter?
30-04-2018T19:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well keeping the price per trip at $20 each, it’d be about three trips"
30-04-2018T19:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Some places are cheaper than others, and some include a shampoo with the cost, while others don’t..."
30-04-2018T19:22:53,Vatruvius,I see...I see...
30-04-2018T19:23:39,Vatruvius,I got nothing. I am of tge opinion to save up for perhaps a more expensive solution that pays for itself in time...and is cool.
30-04-2018T19:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Being a woman’s annoyingly expensive
30-04-2018T19:24:00,Vatruvius,the*
30-04-2018T19:24:41,Twokinds,$20 is what I spend for haircuts per year.
30-04-2018T19:25:25,Vatruvius,"I mean, my sister and I have similar costs. Mine go towards computers, games, and other expensive stuff. My sister spends her stuff on hair, make-up, clothes, art supplies, etc."
30-04-2018T19:25:52,Vatruvius,I pay $0 for haircuts per year. My mom does them. :D
30-04-2018T19:25:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty set on the makeup I have
30-04-2018T19:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Too expensive to have regularly, not to mention it takes time"
30-04-2018T19:26:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn Tom, thats so cheap."
30-04-2018T19:26:26,unsteddyphoenix,I pay like 30
30-04-2018T19:27:04,SpazztasticKiwi,You also have a little less maintenance to deal with
30-04-2018T19:27:17,unsteddyphoenix,I need one desperately though
30-04-2018T19:27:39,unsteddyphoenix,You dont have any maintenance if you dont maintain it ;)
30-04-2018T19:27:51,Vatruvius,"My sister does not buy a lot of make-up, she just gets the expensive stuff like thr Naked sets I think they are called. She just likes to look cute all of the time, not all the time."
30-04-2018T19:28:25,Vatruvius,most* not all
30-04-2018T19:28:53,Twokinds,"I mean, on average. I didn't spend anything last year, since I never got it cut."
30-04-2018T19:29:34,Vatruvius,I am a short hair gut so I get a haircut every 3-5 weeks.
30-04-2018T19:29:59,unsteddyphoenix,statistically ideal
30-04-2018T19:30:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I have layers in my hair
30-04-2018T19:30:47,Vatruvius,"My hair has this annoying habbit of growing out the sideways fadter than on the top. So no matter what my hair goes from nice looking short hair, to bowl cut."
30-04-2018T19:31:10,Vatruvius,side faster*
30-04-2018T19:32:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom from what I’ve seen you’re hair’s about as long as mine, just straighter"
30-04-2018T19:32:49,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah mine seems to grow side-out too
30-04-2018T19:33:01,unsteddyphoenix,I really just have no idea what to do with it
30-04-2018T19:33:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Shave it all. Problem solved
30-04-2018T19:34:04,unsteddyphoenix,Mmm~
30-04-2018T19:34:32,Vatruvius,"No thank you, I like some hair."
30-04-2018T19:35:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Ive had a close cut before, I feel like I go from a ""messy drug dealer"" look to a ""needs help putting on pants in the morning"" look"
30-04-2018T19:35:44,unsteddyphoenix,Its a lose-lose for me~ :/
30-04-2018T19:35:54,SpazztasticKiwi,But look at The Rock - clearly bald is the new mullet to the ladies
30-04-2018T19:36:18,unsteddyphoenix,"The Rock is like  6""6 and jacked"
30-04-2018T19:36:23,unsteddyphoenix,Even I can smell what he's cooking
30-04-2018T19:36:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah it’s definitely the hair
30-04-2018T19:36:49,Twokinds,People often confuse me for The Rock.
30-04-2018T19:37:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure
30-04-2018T19:37:04,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh thats why you grew your hair out

30-04-2018T19:38:29,SpazztasticKiwi,He has that beach tan. You probably have more of a computer screen tan

30-04-2018T19:40:45,SpazztasticKiwi,From your window maybe

30-04-2018T19:42:42,unsteddyphoenix,Not sure how much that counts
30-04-2018T19:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Moonlight is technically sunlight
30-04-2018T19:43:12,unsteddyphoenix,!! thats true!

30-04-2018T19:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been guessed at ranges from 12 to 25

30-04-2018T20:56:34,Twokinds,I don't know what that is.

30-04-2018T21:00:15,Twokinds,I test Twokinds on animals.

30-04-2018T21:04:39,Vatruvius,Ouch.

30-04-2018T21:14:50,Vatruvius,lol
30-04-2018T21:16:05,SpazztasticKiwi,There was a guy in there that looked lost
30-04-2018T21:18:08,Vatruvius,That would be me.
30-04-2018T21:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Saw the same guy later in Victoria’s Secret looking at the perfumes and asking the ladies for help
30-04-2018T21:19:01,Vatruvius,lol
30-04-2018T21:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Girlfriend’s birthday
30-04-2018T21:19:46,Vatruvius,I think I would ask my sister for help if it came to that. Pro's of having a sister.
30-04-2018T21:20:41,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a VS perfume I went in to look for
30-04-2018T21:21:04,SpazztasticKiwi,They either don’t carry it at that store or I didn’t see it
30-04-2018T21:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Only reason I went in too. They got some fluffy robes though
30-04-2018T21:25:18,unsteddyphoenix,Oooo~
30-04-2018T21:26:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I also saw some “sexy shirts”
30-04-2018T21:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a men’s shirt
30-04-2018T21:26:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Just had a VS label on it
30-04-2018T21:29:32,Vatruvius,VS label men's shirt = instant sexy!
30-04-2018T21:30:01,Vatruvius,"Woohoo! I typed sexy without having to bring up a virtual keyboard to type the ""x,"" yes!"
30-04-2018T21:30:15,Twokinds,Would some of you mind giving me your opinion about something?

30-04-2018T21:31:28,Vatruvius,Ohh... :thinking:
30-04-2018T21:32:08,unsteddyphoenix,First instinct for me is the lighter one
30-04-2018T21:32:19,Vatruvius,"I feel like the lighter version is too light in color, but the darker one is too dark. Maybe somewhere inbetween?"
30-04-2018T21:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,He looks like a little toasted marshmallow in the first
30-04-2018T21:33:03,unsteddyphoenix,Daw~ lol big marshmallow
30-04-2018T21:33:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I like them both but the first may be a bit too pale
30-04-2018T21:34:29,Vatruvius,I am all for a darker version of the lighter one.
30-04-2018T21:35:24,unsteddyphoenix,...that is so obtusely specific
30-04-2018T21:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s got a little more color on his tail in the first too
30-04-2018T21:36:05,Vatruvius,"I mean, I agree with Kiwi that the first is too light in color. But I don't want it to be as dark as the second."
30-04-2018T21:36:43,SpazztasticKiwi,He looks so confused in both
30-04-2018T21:36:50,Vatruvius,I didn't even notice at first. I definitely like the more color in his tail in the first one.
30-04-2018T21:37:03,Vatruvius,Isn't that the point Kiwi?
30-04-2018T21:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the foot color on the first one. Is it the same as the gradient on the body or am I seeing it as lighter?
30-04-2018T21:38:20,unsteddyphoenix,Isn't it the same
30-04-2018T21:38:25,Vatruvius,"It is the same, just missing the white."
30-04-2018T21:39:09,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt the colour combo of the first one more... satisfying though?
30-04-2018T21:39:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Reminds me of a cappuccino
30-04-2018T21:40:39,unsteddyphoenix,That's a good thing!

30-04-2018T21:43:00,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hmm
30-04-2018T21:43:02,Vatruvius,A complex fur pattern. :ptv-dealwithit:

30-04-2018T21:45:28,BadFoMo,I'm indifferent to the choices. Sorry.
30-04-2018T21:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Can we combine the tail pattern of the two left ones with the bottom right color scheme?
30-04-2018T21:45:50,Vatruvius,Yes please. ^
30-04-2018T21:45:57,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao ok thats getting a bit silly
30-04-2018T21:46:03,Twokinds,Ignore the patterns
30-04-2018T21:46:08,Twokinds,They're meant to be identical.
30-04-2018T21:46:21,Vatruvius,"Alright, I am going with lighter #2 then."
30-04-2018T21:46:24,Twokinds,This is just about colors.
30-04-2018T21:46:25,Vatruvius,That is my favorite.
30-04-2018T21:47:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Apart from liking the top right one slightly less, the rest are good."
30-04-2018T21:47:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Bottom right then
30-04-2018T21:48:15,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah agreed
30-04-2018T21:48:40,Vatruvius,"Now both #2 and lighter #2 look good. Agh! Either way, I like the colors in the #2 ones more."
30-04-2018T21:49:22,Vatruvius,I really want to combine both #2's.

30-04-2018T21:50:44,Vatruvius,lol
30-04-2018T21:52:32,SpazztasticKiwi,My Dropbox opened feedback on that file when it opened in the app
30-04-2018T21:52:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Just had a small fight trying to get back here
30-04-2018T21:53:18,BadFoMo,...Or you could do that thing I said and have his fur color and pattern change for whatever reason due to a family curse.
30-04-2018T21:53:46,Twokinds,Why would it do that?
30-04-2018T21:53:52,Twokinds,That's silly.
30-04-2018T21:53:52,Vatruvius,That sounds like too much work FoMo. A complex fur pattern sounds better just because that is consistent.
30-04-2018T21:54:01,unsteddyphoenix,mood ring but its fur
30-04-2018T21:54:12,Vatruvius,Mood Fur
30-04-2018T21:54:16,Vatruvius,Spray on mood fur.
30-04-2018T21:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I got the app cause I have some other stuff on it already
30-04-2018T21:54:58,BadFoMo,@Twokinds Nora did it. No reason needed.
30-04-2018T21:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"I click links in this chat and if the link has an app, it asks if I want to get the app"
30-04-2018T21:55:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Then it asks me to sign in
30-04-2018T21:56:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I tapped the little icon in the corner and it’s like “oh you wanna send feedback?”
30-04-2018T21:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"No, Dropbox. I just want to look at the picture. Calm down"
30-04-2018T21:57:19,Vatruvius,lol
30-04-2018T21:57:41,Vatruvius,It wants to make sure its customers has the best experience.
30-04-2018T21:58:41,Bgrmystr2,I still think the darker brown looks better
30-04-2018T21:59:05,Bgrmystr2,"Bottom left or top right, both seem okay to me, it's a nice contrast"
30-04-2018T21:59:13,Bgrmystr2,"the others seem to blended, too yellow"
30-04-2018T21:59:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Can you see who views your Dropbox links?
30-04-2018T21:59:44,unsteddyphoenix,Well the fact that we all seem to disagree should be telling
30-04-2018T22:00:01,Vatruvius,The left ones are definitely too yellow Bgr. I would like to see an in between of the #2 and lighter #2. I think that would be the best.
30-04-2018T22:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I know on some file sharing sites you can view who has clicked your account and viewed what files
30-04-2018T22:00:36,Bgrmystr2,bottom left is not yellow though
30-04-2018T22:00:53,Bgrmystr2,almost can't tell the diff between top left and bottom right lol
30-04-2018T22:00:57,Bgrmystr2,it's very similar
30-04-2018T22:01:08,SpazztasticKiwi,They all look ok to be honest. The main thing I’m thinking of is how washed out he could look compared to some backgrounds
30-04-2018T22:01:33,BadFoMo,"Sorry, but I have to. Colin: As if not being able to do anything that needs a photo is bad enough; what really sucks is when I'm an unnatural color. I still remember the other kids in my class making fun of me because I was PINK for a week!"
30-04-2018T22:01:56,Bgrmystr2,"having a good contrast to his body colors is nice. The lighter it is, the less contrast there will be, and the more he'll blend into some backgrounds"
30-04-2018T22:01:58,Vatruvius,"There is a distinct difference Bgr. I can most certainly see it. Of course, it depends on the individual's ability to distinguish between similar colors. The left ones have more yellow while the right ones have more orange."
30-04-2018T22:02:19,unsteddyphoenix,"What backgrounds are you guys imagining, its a cityscape"
30-04-2018T22:02:27,Bgrmystr2,"I know there is a difference. My display is the issue, it brings out colors more and blends them together"
30-04-2018T22:03:21,Vatruvius,I feel like the yellow in the left ones contrast with Sam's blonde hair too much. That is why I am leaning onto the more orange ones on the right.
30-04-2018T22:03:40,Vatruvius,The orange ones compliment Sam's blonde hair rather than conflict with it.
30-04-2018T22:04:11,unsteddyphoenix,Contrast...with her...hair.
30-04-2018T22:04:15,Bgrmystr2,"xD I don't think I see the same colors you do then, cuz the bottom left one is not yellow at all haha"
30-04-2018T22:04:25,Bgrmystr2,and why would it matter her hair color :o
30-04-2018T22:05:53,Vatruvius,"When it comes to colors, the more color astute you are the better you can see colors and how they compliment or conflict with each other."
30-04-2018T22:06:13,Bgrmystr2,"Yeh, I know that."
30-04-2018T22:06:27,SpazztasticKiwi,The bottom ones are good. Flip a coin
30-04-2018T22:06:29,Vatruvius,"I know there is a entire science about it, I have not studied it at all. I just know from what I see and how I feel the colors interact with each other."
30-04-2018T22:06:39,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah im with spazz
30-04-2018T22:06:50,Vatruvius,The more orange ones on the right go better with Sam than the more yellow ones on the left.
30-04-2018T22:07:19,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...really just not a thing imo
30-04-2018T22:07:21,Bgrmystr2,"xD vatru, what I'd give to see how you see colors for like 5 mins, cuz that must be wonky as hell"
30-04-2018T22:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"According to Dropbox’s color data on the file, there’s not much brightness there"
30-04-2018T22:08:29,unsteddyphoenix,I actually have studied colour theory actually. Not that it makes my opinion more qualified really but.
30-04-2018T22:08:57,Vatruvius,"It is not a thing unsteddy, and it is not wonky Bgr. I got an aptitude test and colors was one of the tests. I scored really high in that subject and because of that careers like interior design were recommended because it is all about colors and how they"
30-04-2018T22:09:02,Vatruvius,compliment each other.
30-04-2018T22:09:38,unsteddyphoenix,https://www.xrite.com/hue-test
30-04-2018T22:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Do you have a favorite, Tom?"
30-04-2018T22:12:45,unsteddyphoenix,If he did i'd assume he'd go with that
30-04-2018T22:13:01,Vatruvius,Go with what?
30-04-2018T22:13:25,unsteddyphoenix,his favourite.
30-04-2018T22:14:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, the link has been buried in chat so it’s unclickable now"
30-04-2018T22:14:19,Vatruvius,"Well, of course."
30-04-2018T22:14:38,Vatruvius,Took that test and it doesn't even give me a score!
30-04-2018T22:14:51,Dadrobit,Unless you're like me and have it open all of the time so that you can catch up.
30-04-2018T22:15:01,Dadrobit,"Also, howdy"
30-04-2018T22:15:12,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
30-04-2018T22:15:26,Vatruvius,I still have the last one with all 4 open if you want me to link it.
30-04-2018T22:15:34,Dadrobit,Bottom left for my money btw.
30-04-2018T22:15:56,unsteddyphoenix,nice
30-04-2018T22:16:20,DRAGONTANOPUG,:ptv-shock:I still need to draw flora. :ptv-sleepy: later....
30-04-2018T22:16:25,Bgrmystr2,test gave me a zero. RIP :ptv-sad:
30-04-2018T22:16:33,Bgrmystr2,"Oh wait, that's a good thing. :v"
30-04-2018T22:16:34,Dadrobit,"Oh, and wasn't one of his feet a different hue last time?"
30-04-2018T22:16:49,unsteddyphoenix,I think that was a mistake though
30-04-2018T22:16:57,Vatruvius,"Got a 0 as well Bgr, but it didn't not amount to anything."
30-04-2018T22:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,All I can think of is he looks like a coffe
30-04-2018T22:16:58,Dadrobit,Too complex maybe.
30-04-2018T22:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,*coffee
30-04-2018T22:17:10,unsteddyphoenix,I think he just forgot to colour it in or somethin
30-04-2018T22:17:31,unsteddyphoenix,http://www.colormunki.com/game/huetest_kiosk
30-04-2018T22:17:33,BadFoMo,I thought that was part of the pattern.
30-04-2018T22:17:33,unsteddyphoenix,ok harder one
30-04-2018T22:17:46,Bgrmystr2,"""didn't not"" :face_palm:"
30-04-2018T22:18:44,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah the bottom left one looks best imo. It's not as dark as the top right, but it's darker than bottom top left, which is darker than bottom right"
30-04-2018T22:19:06,Bgrmystr2,"erh, top left*, darker than bottom right"
30-04-2018T22:19:13,Bgrmystr2,pls fingrs
30-04-2018T22:19:44,SpazztasticKiwi,So have we actually reached a verdict?
30-04-2018T22:20:16,Vatruvius,Everyone seems to like the yellow ones more while I am going for the oranges. So I am losing here.
30-04-2018T22:20:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Well we have a majority ruling, at least."
30-04-2018T22:21:18,Bgrmystr2,"some ppl like the lighter, some ppl like the darker. Honestly, I'd rather top left than bottom right cuz that bottom right one is too light imo"
30-04-2018T22:21:30,Bgrmystr2,but ehh :v
30-04-2018T22:22:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"So there’s a top left, bottom left, and bottom right vote?"
30-04-2018T22:22:37,Bgrmystr2,"well, I'm still bottom left vote"
30-04-2018T22:22:51,Bgrmystr2,they're all pretty close though
30-04-2018T22:22:55,Vatruvius,I just like an in between of the two right ones. The bottom right one is a bit too light I will agree. But the right ones are better color wise than the left ones in my opinion.
30-04-2018T22:22:56,unsteddyphoenix,Im pretty happy with bottom left
30-04-2018T22:23:43,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, if you pull up an image editor and put the image into it, and then use the eyedropper tool or w/e yours is named"
30-04-2018T22:23:50,Bgrmystr2,you can compare the colors individually
30-04-2018T22:23:53,Bgrmystr2,tis what I did
30-04-2018T22:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d say do a Twitter poll
30-04-2018T22:24:19,Bgrmystr2,don't think that's really necessary lol
30-04-2018T22:24:29,SpazztasticKiwi,But nobody else would know what’s going on
30-04-2018T22:24:41,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that wont really yield anything worthwile
30-04-2018T22:24:46,unsteddyphoenix,while
30-04-2018T22:25:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Theyre too similar, I still say you just gotta commit to one Tom"
30-04-2018T22:25:17,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre all winners~
30-04-2018T22:25:37,BadFoMo,Patreon Vote?
30-04-2018T22:25:48,Bgrmystr2,"how is that any different from a twitter vote, Fomo?"
30-04-2018T22:25:56,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-eyeroll::ctwokinds-eyeroll::ctwokinds-eyeroll:
30-04-2018T22:26:05,Bgrmystr2,my thoughts exactly xD
30-04-2018T22:26:10,Vatruvius,Tom noted last time no votes.
30-04-2018T22:26:15,BadFoMo,I don't know.
30-04-2018T22:26:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Back to square one
30-04-2018T22:26:29,Twokinds,Alright I pick the bottom left then
30-04-2018T22:26:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoo
30-04-2018T22:26:43,Dadrobit,"Forst I got a 0, the other one tells me I have a tiny green-blue defficiency."
30-04-2018T22:26:48,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup: sounds good to me
30-04-2018T22:26:57,unsteddyphoenix,Nice
30-04-2018T22:27:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Wait gotta remember which one that was
30-04-2018T22:27:15,Dadrobit,"Which I figure is probably true, have done a couple of those and I do tend to struggle there a bit."
30-04-2018T22:27:30,unsteddyphoenix,Lol these tests are fun 'cause theyre so satisfying~
30-04-2018T22:27:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Colorblindness is most common in men
30-04-2018T22:27:44,Dadrobit,"Also, congratulations on the commitment, Tom!"
30-04-2018T22:27:48,unsteddyphoenix,s'true
30-04-2018T22:27:58,Vatruvius,I can live with bottom left. The differences I am seeing are quite an extreme take.
30-04-2018T22:27:58,unsteddyphoenix,Yes well done it's a scary thing~
30-04-2018T22:27:59,BadFoMo,"Wait, are we supossed to take one of the other choices away now and have Tom chouse again?"
30-04-2018T22:28:12,BadFoMo,*chose
30-04-2018T22:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,The commitment?
30-04-2018T22:28:47,Dadrobit,Commiting to base colors.
30-04-2018T22:29:12,Dadrobit,"Oh, it gives me a score. 7."
30-04-2018T22:29:27,Vatruvius,The more challenging color test said I have perfect color vision.
30-04-2018T22:29:42,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
30-04-2018T22:29:48,unsteddyphoenix,nice~
30-04-2018T22:29:54,Bgrmystr2,didn't cheatereded?
30-04-2018T22:29:57,Vatruvius,Score of 0.
30-04-2018T22:30:05,Vatruvius,How would I even cheat?
30-04-2018T22:30:09,unsteddyphoenix,I got two that time damn.
30-04-2018T22:30:11,Bgrmystr2,color wheels lol
30-04-2018T22:30:15,unsteddyphoenix,I got perfect before but mightve been a fluke
30-04-2018T22:30:26,Vatruvius,I told you I took an aptitude test and scored high in this category.
30-04-2018T22:30:27,Twokinds,It said I had an even more than perfect score.
30-04-2018T22:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,That test would take me forever. The out of order-ness is giving me a complex
30-04-2018T22:30:31,Dadrobit,Screenshot and open it up in gimp. detirmine the colors of the individual slides and then go back to it.
30-04-2018T22:30:32,unsteddyphoenix,You could probably just keep retaking it until you got 0
30-04-2018T22:30:43,unsteddyphoenix,Oh shit he's gone even further beyond
30-04-2018T22:30:45,Dadrobit,determine*
30-04-2018T22:30:48,Bgrmystr2,it's probably not a fluke
30-04-2018T22:30:57,unsteddyphoenix,I heard that all successful artists have a score of -10
30-04-2018T22:30:58,Bgrmystr2,rofl Super Tom 3..
30-04-2018T22:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,You have perfect scores everywhere Tom :ptv-condescending:
30-04-2018T22:31:07,Twokinds,I ordered them even better than they should be.
30-04-2018T22:31:09,Vatruvius,How can you get an even more than perfect score Tom?
30-04-2018T22:31:14,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
30-04-2018T22:31:15,Vatruvius,lol

30-04-2018T22:31:29,unsteddyphoenix,"""Alright but it looks better HERE"
30-04-2018T22:31:36,Dadrobit,"Finally, someone has optimized color!"
30-04-2018T22:31:36,BadFoMo,Oh! You could just leave Colin plain white (and shaded) and let the readers color him for themselfs!
30-04-2018T22:31:53,unsteddyphoenix,Lol fun!
30-04-2018T22:31:56,SpazztasticKiwi,That would go over well
30-04-2018T22:32:15,Vatruvius,Connect the dots style.

30-04-2018T22:32:31,Vatruvius,With numbered regions.
30-04-2018T22:32:35,unsteddyphoenix,Like he needs to glow pink
30-04-2018T22:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Color him 3 different shades of brown and then ask people how many shades there were
30-04-2018T22:32:44,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, what would be better is Colin be transparent color."
30-04-2018T22:32:49,Bgrmystr2,so you can just see behind him
30-04-2018T22:32:49,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 We do?
30-04-2018T22:33:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Then when they say 3, tell them there were 4. Watch them scramble to find the 4th"

30-04-2018T22:36:02,Vatruvius,So many updates! Still have about 4GB of updates left.
30-04-2018T22:36:14,Twokinds,Colin was a ghost all along.

30-04-2018T22:36:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Wolf is a dog
30-04-2018T22:36:39,unsteddyphoenix,IS DOG WOOF WOOF
30-04-2018T22:36:40,Vatruvius,:P
30-04-2018T22:37:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Can you imagine what she’s saying in that picture?
30-04-2018T22:37:19,Bgrmystr2,"wolves are canines like dogs are, but wolves are not dogs"
30-04-2018T22:37:20,unsteddyphoenix,Can there be a Colin and Samms side comic of this side comic?
30-04-2018T22:37:25,Vatruvius,Wolves and dogs have common ancestry.
30-04-2018T22:37:48,Bgrmystr2,animal kingdom is complicated
30-04-2018T22:38:03,Vatruvius,Evolutionary trees are complicated.
30-04-2018T22:38:12,Bgrmystr2,your face is complicated :V

30-04-2018T22:38:32,Vatruvius,:thinking:
30-04-2018T22:38:45,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
30-04-2018T22:38:47,Vatruvius,"Good, I like to keep people guessing."
30-04-2018T22:39:07,Twokinds,Dogs and humans have a common ancestry.
30-04-2018T22:39:17,Bgrmystr2,^ Rolls with it. Nicely done. :ok_hand:
30-04-2018T22:39:29,SpazztasticKiwi,You all have a voice and a face fit for radio
30-04-2018T22:39:33,unsteddyphoenix,Dangerous implication
30-04-2018T22:39:52,unsteddyphoenix,Ok but Tom and Dad both actually do have voices for radio
30-04-2018T22:40:21,Vatruvius,Never heard either's voice to know.
30-04-2018T22:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Wouldn’t know that one as well. Don’t hear them often
30-04-2018T22:40:37,Vatruvius,Technically everything has common ancestry Tom.
30-04-2018T22:40:56,unsteddyphoenix,"I vaguely remember Tom doing a ""radio impression"" and being impressed."
30-04-2018T22:41:02,unsteddyphoenix,So.
30-04-2018T22:41:11,unsteddyphoenix,Its now fact.
30-04-2018T22:41:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Reeeeally now :ptv-tease:
30-04-2018T22:41:38,Vatruvius,"I wish I was there to hear, or saw the video, or what ever. I need to know!"
30-04-2018T22:42:09,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s still a video on YT with him and Mark playing a game and talking
30-04-2018T22:42:16,unsteddyphoenix,"It was a billion years ago, but im a loser so I vaguely remember it"
30-04-2018T22:42:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, I remember my reaction at least"
30-04-2018T22:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,No webcams but I definitely know which one’s Mark
30-04-2018T22:42:40,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I saw that one. It is really old Kiwi. At least three I think."
30-04-2018T22:42:49,Vatruvius,Probably four.
30-04-2018T22:43:06,TheBeckoner,Yeah I too remember that vid
30-04-2018T22:43:13,TheBeckoner,it was something with goblins
30-04-2018T22:43:18,TheBeckoner,I think
30-04-2018T22:43:22,unsteddyphoenix,orcs must die
30-04-2018T22:43:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
30-04-2018T22:43:27,Vatruvius,I would hope I could discern Mark's voice after having been a fan for a few years.
30-04-2018T22:44:00,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re very distinct
30-04-2018T22:44:06,Bgrmystr2,I pulled out the colors and threw em in some comparison squares for ease of viewing if anyone were interested to see how close they are https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/353368103582826499/441082255612444710/ColinColors.png
30-04-2018T22:44:49,Bgrmystr2,They are in the respective corners of what tom posted earlier
30-04-2018T22:45:04,Dadrobit,Back
30-04-2018T22:45:06,Bgrmystr2,wb
30-04-2018T22:45:09,unsteddyphoenix,"oo, neat"
30-04-2018T22:45:25,Vatruvius,"Yeah, they are pretty close. I was just being nit picky. Either way I will be okay with what Tom picks because it will become part of Colin's character and I will not be able to think otherwise after a while."
30-04-2018T22:45:43,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah good choice
30-04-2018T22:46:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Colin will be very good doggo
30-04-2018T22:46:21,Dadrobit,"It's not like Tom has shied from odd colors before. I mean, Natani is purple for Pete's sake!"
30-04-2018T22:46:40,BadFoMo,Wat?
30-04-2018T22:46:40,Bgrmystr2,"yeah unless you're lookin directly at a comparison, you probably won't be able to tell the difference after a while"
30-04-2018T22:46:56,Bgrmystr2,"haha dadro, slightly purple indeed"
30-04-2018T22:47:00,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: &lt;- never forget
30-04-2018T22:47:04,Vatruvius,I am really excited for this comic. Do you know when you plan to actually release pages to this comic Tom? Will it be this year or after Twokinds in which case I guess Twokinds is getting close to the end? Another couple years?
30-04-2018T22:47:15,Twokinds,I'm not sure
30-04-2018T22:47:42,SpazztasticKiwi,TwoKinds is loading...
30-04-2018T22:47:43,unsteddyphoenix,must be very hard to find time to work on it
30-04-2018T22:47:48,Twokinds,I unfortunately have kinda stalled on some of the story.
30-04-2018T22:47:54,Twokinds,"Also, yeah, hard to work."
30-04-2018T22:48:12,Vatruvius,If you could slow time to work more would you?
30-04-2018T22:48:18,Twokinds,YES
30-04-2018T22:48:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, unfortunate ."
30-04-2018T22:48:38,unsteddyphoenix,I wish I could slow time so I had more to waste :/
30-04-2018T22:48:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Clone yourself
30-04-2018T22:48:52,BadFoMo,Ah. We're going Duke Nukem Forever on this project.
30-04-2018T22:48:57,Dadrobit,Life Hack: Do cocaine to speed up yourself and get more work done in a shorter time period! :D
30-04-2018T22:49:08,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
30-04-2018T22:49:15,unsteddyphoenix,shit thats smart
30-04-2018T22:49:25,Vatruvius,"Imagine that fans! For Tom years went bye and Twokinds is over and the new comic with Sam and Colin has started, but to us we are all binging trying to catch up because it has only been a month."
30-04-2018T22:49:26,unsteddyphoenix,Do some opium too it boosts creativity
30-04-2018T22:49:48,Vatruvius,the* not that

30-04-2018T22:50:25,Dadrobit,"Holy crap, cocaine while drinking absinthe would be the worst..."
30-04-2018T22:50:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Drugs are bad kids
30-04-2018T22:50:53,unsteddyphoenix,Absinthe is ridiculous
30-04-2018T22:50:54,Vatruvius,Sounds like you are trying to find the fastest way to kill yourself.
30-04-2018T22:51:32,Dadrobit,"Naw, just the most creative way."
30-04-2018T22:51:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t you know the best way to lose time is alcohol
30-04-2018T22:51:56,Dadrobit,I beg to disagree.
30-04-2018T22:52:15,unsteddyphoenix,Best way is sleep
30-04-2018T22:52:20,unsteddyphoenix,Worse than any drug
30-04-2018T22:52:55,Twokinds,Being able to stop time and just work without aging would be my greatest wish.
30-04-2018T22:53:03,Twokinds,I'd get so much done.
30-04-2018T22:53:09,BadFoMo,Same.
30-04-2018T22:53:13,unsteddyphoenix,Big same
30-04-2018T22:53:30,unsteddyphoenix,Just stress-free space where youre not losing any time?
30-04-2018T22:53:32,unsteddyphoenix,Heaven
30-04-2018T22:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"A small team to help with the little stuff might help, but..."
30-04-2018T22:53:52,Dadrobit,Hm.... I think infinite knowledge of all things would be better imo.
30-04-2018T22:54:12,unsteddyphoenix,Naw
30-04-2018T22:54:13,Dadrobit,Then you would know the optimal way to work and create the finest product.
30-04-2018T22:54:23,Dadrobit,Literally the finest.
30-04-2018T22:54:26,Vatruvius,Infinite knowledge would mean you would not have enough time to share all the knowledge before your death.
30-04-2018T22:54:39,unsteddyphoenix,Unless you learn in yout infinite knowledge how to stop time :thinking:
30-04-2018T22:54:49,Vatruvius,It would be lost with your death.
30-04-2018T22:55:04,Dadrobit,"Eh, I can live with that."
30-04-2018T22:55:07,Twokinds,"Yeah, just like... a little room I could go to whenever I want, outside of time."
30-04-2018T22:55:11,Twokinds,That'd be awesome.
30-04-2018T22:55:20,Dadrobit,I call that the bathroom.
30-04-2018T22:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s called a panic room
30-04-2018T22:55:34,BadFoMo,"Although, being able to just snap your fingers and have the work done right then and there would be nice too."
30-04-2018T22:55:40,unsteddyphoenix,not the same~
30-04-2018T22:56:03,unsteddyphoenix,I honestly fantasize about that way too often
30-04-2018T22:56:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a little yellow rubber room. Comes with this great jacket that helps you hug yourself
30-04-2018T22:56:58,unsteddyphoenix,sounds chill
30-04-2018T22:57:03,DRAGONTANOPUG,G'night guys
30-04-2018T22:57:07,Vatruvius,I assume figuring out the details of chapter 20 is certainly taking time away from Sam and Colin.
30-04-2018T22:57:13,BadFoMo,Good night.
30-04-2018T22:57:21,Vatruvius,Good night TANO!
30-04-2018T22:58:09,Dadrobit,"That reminds me of an old comic form I don't remember where. ""I'm so lonely that sometimes I pretend that I'm choking so that when someone tries to give me the heimlich maneuver, I turn around and get a hug."""
30-04-2018T22:58:20,Dadrobit,cya
30-04-2018T22:58:23,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
30-04-2018T22:58:40,Vatruvius,Wow.
30-04-2018T22:58:50,Vatruvius,That is some hole to get stuck in.
30-04-2018T22:58:53,unsteddyphoenix,Thats sounds more like a prank
30-04-2018T22:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,How bad are your social skills
30-04-2018T22:59:58,unsteddyphoenix,What you dont know is that theyre lonely because theyre a neonazi and noone wants to be near them
30-04-2018T23:00:21,unsteddyphoenix,two sides to every story~
30-04-2018T23:00:23,Dadrobit,"I think it came from this old webcomic that just placed 3-4 real life random ""artsy""photos next to each other and put text over top of them."
30-04-2018T23:00:36,Dadrobit,But I don't recall the name...
30-04-2018T23:01:45,NightMeaty22,Hello...
30-04-2018T23:01:59,Vatruvius,Hey.
30-04-2018T23:02:12,NightMeaty22,How ya doin
30-04-2018T23:02:20,Vatruvius,God.
30-04-2018T23:02:24,Vatruvius,Good*
30-04-2018T23:02:28,Dadrobit,o/ Meaty
30-04-2018T23:02:37,NightMeaty22,o/
30-04-2018T23:03:32,Vatruvius,3GB to go.
30-04-2018T23:05:53,NightMeaty22,When your at school and people complain about not have much friends/followers or what ever and then you say at least your not a social outcast...
30-04-2018T23:06:34,Vatruvius,Best to agree and try to become friends with them.
30-04-2018T23:06:59,Vatruvius,"In your head you can say ""at least you're not a social outcast."""
30-04-2018T23:07:17,NightMeaty22,I dont have good people skills
30-04-2018T23:07:43,Vatruvius,They will develop with time.
30-04-2018T23:08:00,NightMeaty22,True
30-04-2018T23:08:52,Bgrmystr2,"not always, Vatru xD"
30-04-2018T23:09:09,NightMeaty22,True
30-04-2018T23:09:36,Bgrmystr2,you can only be as good with peopling as you are dealt the cards of the people you have to people with.
30-04-2018T23:09:54,Bgrmystr2,"Sometimes, those cards are garbage."
30-04-2018T23:10:29,Bgrmystr2,"and in life, you don't always get a free hand."
30-04-2018T23:11:28,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but no matter what they will improve with time. Eventually your skills improve."
30-04-2018T23:11:49,Vatruvius,Weather that is now or later depending on the people you have to deal with.
30-04-2018T23:11:52,Bgrmystr2,"as long as you meet new people who are not the same as who you've already experienced, sure"
30-04-2018T23:12:21,NightMeaty22,I get told to go to hell for getting someone out in 4 square...
30-04-2018T23:12:54,NightMeaty22,Sigh the life of school
30-04-2018T23:14:57,Vatruvius,That is just petty school stuff.
30-04-2018T23:18:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just found out yet another one of my classmates got married
30-04-2018T23:19:00,NightMeaty22,Thats nice
30-04-2018T23:19:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Starting to feel left behind
30-04-2018T23:19:33,Vatruvius,"But, everyone is in their early twenties right?"
30-04-2018T23:19:33,SpazztasticKiwi,They moving fast
30-04-2018T23:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
30-04-2018T23:20:25,Vatruvius,I don't expect to get married until my mid twenties to late twenties. Probably kids late twenties.
30-04-2018T23:20:39,Vatruvius,"So that is five years to get married, plenty of time."
30-04-2018T23:20:42,NightMeaty22,Roses are red i have a phone no one ever texts me i'm forever alone.
30-04-2018T23:20:44,Vatruvius,A lot can happen in five years.
30-04-2018T23:20:48,TheBeckoner,Same Vat
30-04-2018T23:21:58,Vatruvius,"Slowly but surely converting my sister into a furry. Not to the attractive level, not yet anyway, but still. Slowly, but surely."
30-04-2018T23:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not itching to get married and definitely don’t want kids
30-04-2018T23:22:26,Vatruvius,She has yet to meet sexy Zen.
30-04-2018T23:22:33,Vatruvius,She has not even met Zen at all yet.
30-04-2018T23:22:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Definitely interested in a nice relationship if I run into someone
30-04-2018T23:23:06,Vatruvius,"That is a bummer but it is your life. I will let you know if kids are worth it when I have them, but I think they will be."
30-04-2018T23:23:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Zen is zen
30-04-2018T23:23:45,NightMeaty22,No one knows i'm a furry
30-04-2018T23:23:59,TheBeckoner,we know.
30-04-2018T23:24:13,NightMeaty22,I mean other than you all
30-04-2018T23:24:14,Vatruvius,"You are here, we all know you to be a furry."
30-04-2018T23:24:25,Vatruvius,Tis a furry community.
30-04-2018T23:24:31,TheBeckoner,well mostly
30-04-2018T23:24:33,unsteddyphoenix,no furries allowed
30-04-2018T23:24:39,TheBeckoner,I wouldnt consider myself one
30-04-2018T23:24:40,NightMeaty22,Ok bye
30-04-2018T23:24:45,TheBeckoner,thedirtybois
30-04-2018T23:24:47,Vatruvius,No Beck?
30-04-2018T23:24:48,unsteddyphoenix,o/
30-04-2018T23:24:58,TheBeckoner,Not really Vat.
30-04-2018T23:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,🧘🏻‍♂️
30-04-2018T23:25:23,TheBeckoner,"I like this comic and some other stuff but nothing particularly ""furry"""
30-04-2018T23:26:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re the kind of person that wants an animal in your bed, does that make you a furry?"
30-04-2018T23:26:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Think about it
30-04-2018T23:26:56,Vatruvius,Pretty sure it does Kiwi.
30-04-2018T23:27:00,NightMeaty22,Define furry
30-04-2018T23:27:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I know alot of furries then
30-04-2018T23:28:08,Dadrobit,A Softer World!
30-04-2018T23:28:12,Dadrobit,That was the comic!
30-04-2018T23:28:24,Dadrobit,But I can't find the strip...
30-04-2018T23:29:29,Vatruvius,Furrys are more relate-able to me because they are not human so all the negative aspects of humans do not apply too much for me. Seen enough bad character to where furry characters seem like a reprieve.
30-04-2018T23:30:08,Vatruvius,"I literally sang that in my head like ""A better world..."" but ""A softer world..."""
30-04-2018T23:30:49,TheBeckoner,Like
30-04-2018T23:31:06,TheBeckoner,an anthro-animal? or like beastality?
30-04-2018T23:31:15,TheBeckoner,2 different things I think
30-04-2018T23:31:21,Vatruvius,"anthro, not animal."
30-04-2018T23:31:26,TheBeckoner,lol good
30-04-2018T23:31:48,Dadrobit,"I can't find the exact one, but here's a similar http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=410"
30-04-2018T23:32:37,Vatruvius,"I have a feeling though that the Disney movies may have helped some become furrys with Lion King and stuff. Helped us see others as people, not who they are physically."
30-04-2018T23:33:21,Vatruvius,I wonder if furrys are less likely to be racists?
30-04-2018T23:34:11,Dadrobit,No
30-04-2018T23:34:52,TheBeckoner,I think anything that could reach a human level of existence has an equal chance of being racist.
30-04-2018T23:35:09,TheBeckoner,"""hug job"" lol"
30-04-2018T23:36:41,TheBeckoner,these are kinda funny tbh
30-04-2018T23:37:20,Dadrobit,Haven't read it in yeeeears.
30-04-2018T23:37:29,Dadrobit,Kinda sad to see it's finished.
30-04-2018T23:38:44,Vatruvius,I was not talking about furry characters but furry people. Would less people who are furrys be racists compared to non-furry people.
30-04-2018T23:39:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Guys every time I see someone quote “50 Shades of Grey”, I wonder how it got published, let alone became a hit"
30-04-2018T23:39:38,TheBeckoner,It doesnt seem to be in any sort of meaningful order though Dadro...is it supposed to be?
30-04-2018T23:41:30,Vatruvius,"They made or a making a third movie right? Why would anyone want to play either roles in those films. You will be staring in some ""exotic"" sex scenes. Multiple of them. For, ""entertainment."""
30-04-2018T23:41:35,Vatruvius,No thank you.
30-04-2018T23:41:46,TheBeckoner,like as far as it being finished. I suppose it was just for entertainment?
30-04-2018T23:42:06,TheBeckoner,"my brain is answering my own questions, that's definitely what it is lol"
30-04-2018T23:42:21,unsteddyphoenix,Depends
30-04-2018T23:42:35,unsteddyphoenix,Is there a correlation between education and lowered racism?
30-04-2018T23:43:05,Vatruvius,"I do not understand why if became a hit, the movies or the book. People watch/read that stuff but hear about furrys and *gasp*, bestiality!"
30-04-2018T23:43:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Presumably if youre a furry you have an internet connection, and if you have that youre from the wealthier parts of the world"
30-04-2018T23:43:30,unsteddyphoenix,And if youre from the wealthier parts of the world youre likely more educated than a normal person
30-04-2018T23:43:50,unsteddyphoenix,"So in that way, in general a furry could be less racist on average"
30-04-2018T23:44:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s disturbing nonsense is what it is
30-04-2018T23:44:19,Vatruvius,"That is probably true, but I know some well put off people that are racist. But perhaps being a furry really is not part of it. Just some non-racist educated individuals like furrys."
30-04-2018T23:44:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I know at least two movies are out
30-04-2018T23:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve met some awfully racist people
30-04-2018T23:44:57,NightMeaty22,My dad
30-04-2018T23:45:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Stupidly racist, even"
30-04-2018T23:45:20,unsteddyphoenix,The fact that you note it means its uncommon
30-04-2018T23:45:21,Vatruvius,I personally would question anyone who thought 50 Shade of Grey was okay and furrys as sin.
30-04-2018T23:46:33,TheBeckoner,Whenever I have a hard question or one with many answers I always think this:
30-04-2018T23:46:40,TheBeckoner,"""We all die eventually"""
30-04-2018T23:46:46,TheBeckoner,really all it boils down to
30-04-2018T23:47:06,TheBeckoner,helps me not worry too much
30-04-2018T23:48:34,Vatruvius,"1GB left, yes!"
30-04-2018T23:49:49,TheBeckoner,of?
30-04-2018T23:50:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Ok, i just got the email at fuckin 11 o clock pm that tom posted scarf nuzz"

30-04-2018T23:50:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,When i was trying to sleep
30-04-2018T23:50:32,Vatruvius,That was posted earlier today.
30-04-2018T23:50:37,DRAGONTANOPUG,Scared em tp hell
30-04-2018T23:50:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,I get them late for some reason
30-04-2018T23:50:54,Vatruvius,Perhaps turn off your phone when you go to sleep?
30-04-2018T23:51:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,Alarm..
30-04-2018T23:51:15,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s called a notification
30-04-2018T23:51:19,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yep
30-04-2018T23:51:19,Vatruvius,"Then turn off notifications, or sound notifications. Put your phone on silent."
30-04-2018T23:51:40,DRAGONTANOPUG,:ptv-sleepy: nighty
30-04-2018T23:52:25,Vatruvius,You still there Tom?
30-04-2018T23:52:45,Twokinds,no
30-04-2018T23:53:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Darn
30-04-2018T23:53:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Well we can gossip if he’s gone
30-04-2018T23:53:28,Vatruvius,I guess I will ask later then.
30-04-2018T23:53:44,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
30-04-2018T23:53:49,NightMeaty22,I hate allergies my eyes hurt
30-04-2018T23:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t mention allergies. You’ll awaken Tom
30-04-2018T23:54:31,Vatruvius,I have been asking before but would a sketch about Maren and Trace pre-comic be a spoiler? Can I suggest something about them or would it not pass your screening?
30-04-2018T23:54:49,Vatruvius,"We are trying to gossip here, don't mention them Meaty."
30-04-2018T23:54:49,Twokinds,Depends
30-04-2018T23:55:12,Vatruvius,It would just be a date. Maren and Trace on a date pre-comic.
30-04-2018T23:55:20,NightMeaty22,Ok i'll just dwell in my box
30-04-2018T23:56:16,Twokinds,I dunno
30-04-2018T23:56:21,Twokinds,Probably fine
30-04-2018T23:56:30,Vatruvius,Cool.
30-04-2018T23:56:40,Vatruvius,It seemed like something a lot of people wanted to see.
30-04-2018T23:56:47,Dadrobit,":( I smelt rain and went outside to watch, but it was just a drizzle so light that the ground doesn't even show the drops..."
30-04-2018T23:56:52,Vatruvius,When I suggested it in chat.
30-04-2018T23:57:00,Dadrobit,Why must I be teased so...
30-04-2018T23:57:06,Vatruvius,Sorry Dadro.
30-04-2018T23:57:18,Vatruvius,Perhaps listen to storm sounds?
30-04-2018T23:57:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Do a rain dance
30-04-2018T23:57:56,Dadrobit,":/ I don't want to just hear it, I want there to be actual rain pls."
30-04-2018T23:57:58,NightMeaty22,Once your asleep rain will come
30-04-2018T23:58:11,Vatruvius,Strip into your birthday suit and dance outside calling to the clouds. Bound to work. Have some take video too...it will ah...help with getting it to rain. :D
30-04-2018T23:58:22,Dadrobit,"Everything is so dry and dusty, my allergies have been on hyper drive."
30-04-2018T23:58:40,Vatruvius,someone*
30-04-2018T23:58:47,SpazztasticKiwi,What part of don’t mention allergies didn’t we cover
30-04-2018T23:59:22,NightMeaty22,Mine are not as bad as they use to be
30-04-2018T23:59:35,Dadrobit,Lemme just call my brother up and get him to bring over his Go Pro.
30-04-2018T23:59:51,Vatruvius,Yes!
