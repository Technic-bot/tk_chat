12-07-2018T10:32:13,Twokinds,lol I just terribly painted over Raine to make W0lfmare's character Ember during his stream as a joke XD
12-07-2018T10:39:06,iliar,"Tom, you know, I think this week is much funny than usually. I like you streams. But it's spoilers. When you don't know what will be today it force you waiting new sketch."
12-07-2018T10:43:13,SiliconCarbide,"true, but it also lacks the chat's reaction :&gt;"

12-07-2018T10:58:14,SiliconCarbide,off to a successfull day i see
12-07-2018T10:58:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet I can still manage to royally screw up my English
12-07-2018T10:59:16,SiliconCarbide,there are worse crimes
12-07-2018T11:00:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Last night I nearly confused myself on my nightly German review
12-07-2018T11:00:48,iliar,"I interesting why you were surprised by Russian phrase, but was not surprised by German phrase."
12-07-2018T11:01:11,SiliconCarbide,germans being suprising isnt something thats itnernationally accepted
12-07-2018T11:01:14,SiliconCarbide,not anymore

12-07-2018T13:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys I just realized it’s Friday the 13th

12-07-2018T15:33:15,Bgrmystr2,"yes, you can see it on the schedule at the top of the chat. :)"

12-07-2018T16:08:45,Gundurr,OH! I thought today was sunday
12-07-2018T16:19:37,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-wondering: if you thought today was sunday, why did you ask about friday?"
12-07-2018T16:41:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone from Virginia tried to call me
12-07-2018T16:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know anyone from Virginia
12-07-2018T17:16:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Has anyone suggested a baby Nibbly sketch yet
12-07-2018T17:24:54,CrRAR,Nope I do not believe so.
12-07-2018T17:25:25,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
12-07-2018T17:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,We need it
12-07-2018T17:55:51,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
12-07-2018T17:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Complete with tiny bow and bottle
12-07-2018T17:56:11,Twokinds,"sword, scale"
12-07-2018T17:56:26,Twokinds,any other details that are important for JUSTICE
12-07-2018T17:56:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly as Justice?
12-07-2018T17:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh why not
12-07-2018T17:57:10,Twokinds,I thought you asked for Flora
12-07-2018T17:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,That death glare she gave Sythe would be enough to put the fear of God unto anyone
12-07-2018T17:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,*into
12-07-2018T17:57:24,BluePhantom90,Btw tom what new pic are you going to post today?
12-07-2018T17:57:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I asked for Flora but if you want to try Nib instead I don’t mind
12-07-2018T17:57:42,Bgrmystr2,"lol tom, why not both? :v"
12-07-2018T17:57:56,Bgrmystr2,"probably a new one we haven't seen, blue"
12-07-2018T17:58:01,Bgrmystr2,obviously.
12-07-2018T17:58:23,SpazztasticKiwi,The sword and scale are factors yea
12-07-2018T17:58:24,Twokinds,I'm confused why nibs?
12-07-2018T17:58:26,Bgrmystr2,that or he'll post one we already saw like.. maybe 2 months ago. Just as a repost.
12-07-2018T17:58:26,Twokinds,I just got in
12-07-2018T17:58:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I was just asking if anyone had suggested a baby Nib sketch before
12-07-2018T17:58:55,Twokinds,I'm asking if there's anything else I should draw on your tarot card
12-07-2018T17:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Justice is sometimes shown with a blindfold
12-07-2018T17:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,For the Justice is blind thing
12-07-2018T17:59:54,Bgrmystr2,even though justice isn't blind at all xD
12-07-2018T18:00:03,Bgrmystr2,kinda defeats the purpose of being justice to begin with..
12-07-2018T18:00:17,Bgrmystr2,never did understand that.
12-07-2018T18:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,But she’s also sometimes drawn with a veil for convenient censorship too
12-07-2018T18:01:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Justice is considered “blind” because she always looks at facts and evidence rather than the two sides
12-07-2018T18:01:41,Bgrmystr2,I guess whoever thought of that didn't actually realize that's not how being blind works :/
12-07-2018T18:01:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"She isn’t personally involved or invested in either side, nor does she try to be"
12-07-2018T18:02:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"She is completely unbiased, is the main point. It’s also the reason she has the scales. They weigh the sides and the “lighter”, “better” side outweighs the evil and wins in her eyes"
12-07-2018T18:02:57,SpazztasticKiwi,The heavier side gets the sword
12-07-2018T18:03:24,Bgrmystr2,pity she couldn't stab them since she doesn't know where they are :V
12-07-2018T18:03:40,Bgrmystr2,in b4 running away
12-07-2018T18:03:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Though also keep in mind I say she because she’s so often seen as “Lady” Justice
12-07-2018T18:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But besides my rambling any other questions
12-07-2018T18:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m about to go see if Friday the 13th is on
12-07-2018T18:05:47,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it's friday the 13th right now..
12-07-2018T18:05:53,Bgrmystr2,for everyone
12-07-2018T18:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s on. Missed the first movie
12-07-2018T18:06:35,NightMeaty22,Hello
12-07-2018T18:06:44,Bgrmystr2,"wait, there's movies?"
12-07-2018T18:06:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
12-07-2018T18:07:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Friday the 13th is the Jason Voorhees movies
12-07-2018T18:07:21,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
12-07-2018T18:07:44,SpazztasticKiwi,The dude with the machete

12-07-2018T18:07:55,Bgrmystr2,oh with the ski mask?
12-07-2018T18:08:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Bingo
12-07-2018T18:08:08,Bgrmystr2,that horror thing
12-07-2018T18:08:10,Bgrmystr2,okay
12-07-2018T18:08:14,Bgrmystr2,I dunno the last name
12-07-2018T18:08:29,Bgrmystr2,"I knew that was a movie, didn't know the name of it though"
12-07-2018T18:08:32,Bgrmystr2,not into horror
12-07-2018T18:08:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it’s technically Jason Montgomery Voorhees but nobody ever looks into his middle name
12-07-2018T18:09:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Some say it’s “Lee”, and a few others say he doesn’t have a middle name"
12-07-2018T18:10:40,Bgrmystr2,will not remember that
12-07-2018T18:11:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t expect you to
12-07-2018T18:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t worry
12-07-2018T18:11:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m the one with the slight obsession
12-07-2018T18:11:23,Bgrmystr2,okay :)
12-07-2018T18:11:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Slight
12-07-2018T18:29:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve always wondered why they decided not to completely explain why his dad’s not around anymore
12-07-2018T18:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Budget is my guess
12-07-2018T18:45:06,Twokinds,probs
12-07-2018T18:49:55,SpazztasticKiwi,But the problem is it doesn’t match the comics
12-07-2018T18:49:55,BluePhantom90,Sooo Tom how you been?
12-07-2018T18:54:38,Twokinds,Not bad
12-07-2018T18:54:47,Twokinds,Just a little stressed this month
12-07-2018T18:55:31,BluePhantom90,heh yeah you did one Con and soon off to another but farther and in a different time Zone.
12-07-2018T18:55:36,CrRAR,"things to do, places to be~"
12-07-2018T18:56:55,BluePhantom90,well I know you did some of your pic's I had a Sam and Colin joke one I thought you might have decided to draw.
12-07-2018T18:57:48,Twokinds,I'm looking forward to a normal month
12-07-2018T18:58:08,Combak,I can imagine!
12-07-2018T18:58:09,CrRAR,mmm
12-07-2018T18:58:12,Combak,"Also, hi all."
12-07-2018T18:58:12,BluePhantom90,after this month lol

12-07-2018T18:59:30,SpazztasticKiwi,“Normal”
12-07-2018T18:59:33,CrRAR,issssokay
12-07-2018T18:59:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Funny
12-07-2018T19:00:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve basically given up on normal. “Steady” is more likely
12-07-2018T19:02:12,CrRAR,xD
12-07-2018T19:02:28,CrRAR,something something SteadyPhoenix?
12-07-2018T19:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s “Steddy”
12-07-2018T19:03:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Very different
12-07-2018T19:03:29,CrRAR,lol
12-07-2018T19:05:03,SpazztasticKiwi,When in the history of horror movies has it been a good idea to skinny dip in the lake alone
12-07-2018T19:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,At NiGhT
12-07-2018T19:06:08,NightMeaty22,...
12-07-2018T19:08:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Also won’t there be 3 cons for you this month
12-07-2018T19:09:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I guess one was late last month
12-07-2018T19:21:29,Bgrmystr2,most people don't consider themselves in a horror movie
12-07-2018T19:23:34,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
12-07-2018T19:23:40,CrRAR,xD Flora did and she's okay!
12-07-2018T19:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Skinny dipping in a lake still isn’t a good idea
12-07-2018T19:24:08,CrRAR,:fish:
12-07-2018T19:24:18,Bgrmystr2,Flora's also not in a horror movie

12-07-2018T19:25:22,CrRAR,lol
12-07-2018T19:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,In the movies it seems everyone wants to touch the butt
12-07-2018T19:26:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s why half of the idiots die
12-07-2018T19:26:34,CrRAR,yeah... then they get murdered
12-07-2018T19:27:22,CrRAR,you'd think in the movie universe natural selection would have balanced things out.
12-07-2018T19:27:32,CrRAR,Only the prudes survive!
12-07-2018T19:27:44,CrRAR,*mass extinction*
12-07-2018T19:28:44,CrRAR,It turns out Mad Max is actually just a Sequel to most Friday the 13th movies.
12-07-2018T19:29:10,CrRAR,...explains all the freaky masks.
12-07-2018T19:33:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I kinda wish they’d remake some of the first few movies

12-07-2018T23:41:01,ZRO4825,"Actually turned out very well, Sage. And I like the effect of the pattern on her bottoms. Looks nifty. =D"
12-07-2018T23:41:04,RimaDraws,um yea i got refs for days on my phone

12-07-2018T23:41:53,Dadrobit,Welcome to the Mac Ecosystem eh?
12-07-2018T23:42:08,Ordithus,"Sage knows what he wants to draw, lol"
12-07-2018T23:42:10,RimaDraws,i mean i like my mac just it was my clumsy fault so i live with my mistakes
12-07-2018T23:42:24,aeoronwah,I should get a maid outfit for my fursuit
12-07-2018T23:42:25,Bgrmystr2,"Rima, just take the hard drive out of the thing"
12-07-2018T23:42:29,Bgrmystr2,and send the pc in
12-07-2018T23:42:30,TheFDdriver,buy 1 for the price of 2 and get the second one for free!!
12-07-2018T23:42:36,Cyborgthree,yea that
12-07-2018T23:42:38,RimaDraws,it actually worked alot better than my HP
12-07-2018T23:42:39,Bgrmystr2,it's really not difficult
12-07-2018T23:42:41,RimaDraws,and i dont know how
12-07-2018T23:42:52,Dadrobit,"I worked with a Mac for about 3 years. When they work, great. But good lord did they have problems."
12-07-2018T23:43:00,Bgrmystr2,"internet will help, lots of instructions"
12-07-2018T23:43:05,ZRO4825,Last time I used a Mac was back in high school.
12-07-2018T23:43:09,RimaDraws,yea ill probably do that
12-07-2018T23:43:10,RimaDraws,maybe
12-07-2018T23:43:23,Cyborgthree,look up tutorials and throw the mac out
12-07-2018T23:43:24,rinrin,gu
12-07-2018T23:43:26,rinrin,hi
12-07-2018T23:43:29,Ordithus,The first computer I ever used was an Apple 2
12-07-2018T23:43:34,Cyborgthree,if you dont want it
12-07-2018T23:43:44,Bgrmystr2,the hard drive with all your stuff on it is not gonna be necessary
12-07-2018T23:43:50,Bgrmystr2,unless it was damaged too
12-07-2018T23:43:51,Dadrobit,They were brand new iMac Pros. Still gave headaches nearly every third day with crashes and freezing.
12-07-2018T23:43:52,RimaDraws,frankly i only owned one mac comp and that was this one
12-07-2018T23:44:07,Bgrmystr2,which is pretty doubtful since they're usually at the bottom in a corner
12-07-2018T23:44:30,Cyborgthree,worth a check tho
12-07-2018T23:45:06,RimaDraws,where at in the corner
12-07-2018T23:45:28,ZRO4825,"Ord, ever use a Commodore64?"
12-07-2018T23:45:33,Ordithus,Nope
12-07-2018T23:45:58,ZRO4825,"Ahhh, that was the first computer I used, lol. Did my beginner gaming days on one. =D"
12-07-2018T23:46:00,Combak,Is that Youngtani?
12-07-2018T23:46:02,Cyborgthree,left i think
12-07-2018T23:46:11,Ordithus,Mindscape manly Natani
12-07-2018T23:46:15,RimaDraws,id have to remove the screws then take it out
12-07-2018T23:46:38,Cyborgthree,just do that if you dont want the laptop anymore
12-07-2018T23:46:40,Ordithus,Some of my early gaming was on some ancient MsDOS thing
12-07-2018T23:47:21,Bgrmystr2,"it's different for most laptops, Rima"
12-07-2018T23:47:23,ZRO4825,"Yeah, Commodore preceded those by a few years, lol"
12-07-2018T23:47:31,Bgrmystr2,but usually you see a few screws
12-07-2018T23:48:02,Bgrmystr2,you'll definitely want the computer off before pulling the thing out though
12-07-2018T23:48:10,Cyborgthree,thats a yes
12-07-2018T23:48:27,TheFDdriver,thats why my old computer broke...
12-07-2018T23:48:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: &lt;3

12-07-2018T23:55:33,ZRO4825,"Yeah, i got like 3 different chats going on Discord, plus 2 different stream windows up right now. XD"
12-07-2018T23:55:51,TheFDdriver,how can you even manage?
12-07-2018T23:56:01,Bgrmystr2,I can do it easily
12-07-2018T23:56:05,Bgrmystr2,but I have three displays so
12-07-2018T23:56:07,Cyborgthree,joined 4 channels at once for someresion
12-07-2018T23:56:08,TheFDdriver,i cant
12-07-2018T23:56:44,TheFDdriver,i have a phone so that explains
12-07-2018T23:56:51,Cyborgthree,no wonder
