03-01-2018T19:20:29,MetalAppleSauce,"oh yeah. two snow wolves, not one"
03-01-2018T19:20:30,MetalAppleSauce,my bad

03-01-2018T19:24:20,MidnightBlue78,Tom is multitasker
03-01-2018T19:24:28,Twokinds,"Dunno, never read the books. Just watched his videos."
03-01-2018T19:24:34,MisanthropyComics,I envy multitasking.
03-01-2018T19:24:40,Kanrod,Flora booty~ :3
03-01-2018T19:24:42,Bgrmystr2,"then practice it, Mis"
03-01-2018T19:24:47,MetalAppleSauce,"So the final tally of the two parties (besides trace) are 1 Tiger, 2 Forest Wolves, 2 Snow Wolves, 3 Basitins, 6 Humans, 1 Doggo, 1 Fox, 1 Feline/Canine hybrid, 2 Dragons, a Squirrel, and whatever Roselyn accumulated in the estate backyard over the years."
03-01-2018T19:24:56,Dadrobit,"Seen a couple of his videos, good way to pass the time back when I was security."
03-01-2018T19:24:56,MisanthropyComics,I will =D
03-01-2018T19:25:05,DevlNuK,I only do 1 task
03-01-2018T19:25:22,MuonNeutrino,"@MetalAppleSauce is that counting raine as one of the snow wolves, one of the humans, or both?"
03-01-2018T19:25:40,Bgrmystr2,"it should count Raine as a human, honestly, but I don't know"
03-01-2018T19:25:41,Pokemonstarfox,I thinck both
03-01-2018T19:25:41,Dadrobit,Human
03-01-2018T19:25:42,MetalAppleSauce,"counting raine as a snow wolf, not counting her as a human in that list"
03-01-2018T19:25:54,Twokinds,Yeah I like listening to his tips on writing
03-01-2018T19:25:55,Bgrmystr2,then your list is wrong
03-01-2018T19:25:56,MuonNeutrino,i'd count her as her own category
03-01-2018T19:25:59,MuonNeutrino,like kat is
03-01-2018T19:26:05,Terryschannel,"So it's decided, I'm keeping keith"

03-01-2018T19:26:41,LeKnightWolf,yeah kat is on her own
03-01-2018T19:26:41,QiblitheSandwing,Personal Theory:
03-01-2018T19:26:44,Bgrmystr2,why is it difficult to understand that Raine is a human that transforms into a wolf?
03-01-2018T19:26:45,QiblitheSandwing,Chaos is humans
03-01-2018T19:26:46,NeonMitsumi,:cneonmitsumi-floof_grenade:
03-01-2018T19:26:49,MetalAppleSauce,Raine counts for her oun category just as much as Karen
03-01-2018T19:26:51,QiblitheSandwing,and Order is basitin
03-01-2018T19:27:04,LeKnightWolf,well not really
03-01-2018T19:27:07,DevlNuK,¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
03-01-2018T19:27:17,Dadrobit,Not really. Both are humans.
03-01-2018T19:27:17,thestooge,Huh I come back and Tom is back coloring the panel I last saw him ink!
03-01-2018T19:27:22,Bgrmystr2,"Karen is human too, Metal :P"
03-01-2018T19:27:25,LeKnightWolf,it is just the transformation aspect that has you thinking of that
03-01-2018T19:27:28,Pokemonstarfox,@Twokinds what is your reaction if someone uses some of your characters on a comic
03-01-2018T19:27:31,QiblitheSandwing,@Twokinds Will the Merfolk ever show up?
03-01-2018T19:27:34,MetalAppleSauce,I know. karen was counted as one of the 6 humans
03-01-2018T19:27:44,Bgrmystr2,then why wasn't Raine? :P
03-01-2018T19:27:50,QiblitheSandwing,"@Pokemonstarfox, he says that as long as its attributed and not commercial, it's fine"
03-01-2018T19:27:57,Dadrobit,"Poke, usually you end up self harming in a tub in France and getting banned."
03-01-2018T19:27:59,Twokinds,Not in the mainline comics
03-01-2018T19:28:02,MetalAppleSauce,"meh, idk. euchre seems like the nicer parent"
03-01-2018T19:28:03,QiblitheSandwing,Raine is a halfkind though
03-01-2018T19:28:05,LeKnightWolf,pokemonstarfox he will obviously report them and take that out
03-01-2018T19:28:10,Bgrmystr2,"No she's not, Qib"
03-01-2018T19:28:24,Pokemonstarfox,I see
03-01-2018T19:28:30,djikoz,Raine is a human with transformation abilities
03-01-2018T19:28:33,Dadrobit,Euchre is a dick yo. Left his cousin to die at the gallows!
03-01-2018T19:28:42,Bgrmystr2,"Exactly, dadro"
03-01-2018T19:28:53,Twokinds,Raine is full human with the ability to transform into a wolf. her parents were both humans when she was conceived.
03-01-2018T19:28:54,thestooge,It was kinda her fault for getting captured
03-01-2018T19:28:55,QiblitheSandwing,"@LeKnightWolf, as long as he's attributed and it isn't monetized, he has said he doesn't care"

03-01-2018T19:35:30,MetalAppleSauce,wait a second
03-01-2018T19:35:35,MetalAppleSauce,*looks at the tk wiki*
03-01-2018T19:35:39,MetalAppleSauce,Landen's a DUDE?
03-01-2018T19:35:44,NeonMitsumi,Yes?
03-01-2018T19:35:44,QiblitheSandwing,Yeah
03-01-2018T19:35:45,Bgrmystr2,"plus, it's based on trace's feelings on the matter, not just simply ""uninvited guests"""
03-01-2018T19:35:45,MviluUatusun,I guess Natani is looking at Zen in the last panel.
03-01-2018T19:35:49,SageSaga,you doubt the stupidity of kids
03-01-2018T19:35:49,MidnightBlue78,Yep
03-01-2018T19:35:50,MrEase,"my point is it has horrific implications, and Rose taking advantage of it to get eggs, as if she's used to it happening all the time has horrific implications that damage her character"
03-01-2018T19:36:00,unsteddyphoenix,Then it's just natural selection Sage
03-01-2018T19:36:00,Dadrobit,"Shit, yeah, kids will go hella far to get into trouble. I know i did..."
03-01-2018T19:36:04,Bgrmystr2,"if trace would have allowed those kids to play, they wouldn't have anything done to them"
03-01-2018T19:36:05,zanAspera,"If they were dumb inough to break into the murderous Grand Templar's estate, the'd be lucky to only be turned into ivestock until Nora decided to reverse it"
03-01-2018T19:36:09,TheBeckoner,Hmm I guess
03-01-2018T19:36:14,SageSaga,what if the spell detects intent?
03-01-2018T19:36:19,Bgrmystr2,"it does, Sage"
03-01-2018T19:36:30,DJSylveon,Its onlly horrific if you then turn around and eat 20 raw eggs a day
03-01-2018T19:36:39,Dadrobit,It does detect intent.
03-01-2018T19:36:45,Ordithus,"I doubt Nora would really care all that much, honestly."
03-01-2018T19:36:48,MetalAppleSauce,When I was a lad I ate four doze eggs
03-01-2018T19:36:55,MetalAppleSauce,dozen*
03-01-2018T19:36:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,angry zen face make me feel things
03-01-2018T19:37:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, that type of thing is beneath Nora"
03-01-2018T19:37:02,funnyman42,every day to help me get large?
03-01-2018T19:37:07,Ordithus,"""He seems happy as a chicken"""
03-01-2018T19:37:08,MrEase,Not to mention its a needless cutaway that only serves to break tension and interrupt the reunion
03-01-2018T19:37:20,Dadrobit,"Still against it myself, Blackstone formula and all that."
03-01-2018T19:37:27,Twokinds,The spell functions via universal truth.
03-01-2018T19:37:30,MetalAppleSauce,But now that I am grown I eat 5 dozen eggs so I'm roughly the size of a barge
03-01-2018T19:37:40,zanAspera,"Oh, Nora has a playful Vengence streak, but she does value justice..."
03-01-2018T19:37:41,TheBeckoner,lol
03-01-2018T19:37:44,unsteddyphoenix,Which is irony right?
03-01-2018T19:37:48,CrimsonHelsing,Unified field theory xD
03-01-2018T19:37:49,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the universal truth?
03-01-2018T19:37:51,DJSylveon,Ok but are the eggs raw when consummed?
03-01-2018T19:37:58,Twokinds,"If Trace himself allows in an assassin disguised as a servant, the spell will still kick them out because Trace wouldn't want him in if he knew."
03-01-2018T19:38:12,QiblitheSandwing,Pretty convenient spell
03-01-2018T19:38:14,unsteddyphoenix,What a complicated spell
03-01-2018T19:38:17,TheBeckoner,"""kick him out"""
03-01-2018T19:38:18,SageSaga,that spell is OP
03-01-2018T19:38:20,Bgrmystr2,best fucking spell
03-01-2018T19:38:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nora is op
03-01-2018T19:38:24,Bgrmystr2,BEST
03-01-2018T19:38:25,unsteddyphoenix,So the spells only as evil as the owner?
03-01-2018T19:38:27,MrEase,I feel like Nora's kinda morally bankrupt and horrible
03-01-2018T19:38:28,CrimsonHelsing,Oh Nora you are a genius
03-01-2018T19:38:29,unsteddyphoenix,Thats even WORSE
03-01-2018T19:38:39,Bgrmystr2,"sounds about right, phoenix"
03-01-2018T19:38:40,DJSylveon,The universe right clicks them and hits the first red text
03-01-2018T19:38:48,zanAspera,Nora is awesome.   Don't mess with the Dragons
03-01-2018T19:38:57,QiblitheSandwing,"Wait, what if someone tried to go in as an innocent, but then got possessed from a distance or soemthing?"
03-01-2018T19:38:58,SageSaga,Nora's morals dont have to be considered on a human level
03-01-2018T19:39:02,QiblitheSandwing,would it read the future?
03-01-2018T19:39:06,MrEase,she just let trace be a genocidal monster despite being like the one creature that had the power to stop him
03-01-2018T19:39:08,MetalAppleSauce,Of course Nora's morally bankrupt. She made mike a girl for shits and giggles
03-01-2018T19:39:11,MarshallMelon,"So if Trace were to die without Nora dispelling it, wouldn't it just go haywire?"
03-01-2018T19:39:35,SageSaga,we dont really know if Traces history as a monster is true or not or if he was responsible
03-01-2018T19:39:35,zanAspera,That was naught but a harmless prank
03-01-2018T19:39:40,TheBeckoner,It would probably just act on what it knew from him previously
03-01-2018T19:39:41,zanAspera,Mike was fine
03-01-2018T19:39:55,Bgrmystr2,how would the possessor get into the house?
03-01-2018T19:40:00,MarshallMelon,Or shut down. No input = no spell
03-01-2018T19:40:07,Arcus27,"I‚Äôd say Nora has a looser moral code than most, but that doesn‚Äôt make her evil."
03-01-2018T19:40:07,TheBeckoner,Or that
03-01-2018T19:40:07,Bgrmystr2,the house wouldn't let a posessor get into the house with that kind of intent anyway
03-01-2018T19:40:08,MrEase,At least mike doesn't have to live out the rest of his life as a hen being farmed for eggs
03-01-2018T19:40:12,MetalAppleSauce,"It's Nora's spell, not Trace's"
03-01-2018T19:40:20,unsteddyphoenix,Trace did nothing wrong?
03-01-2018T19:40:21,Dadrobit,Nora is a Lovecraft Horror. An imperceptibly terrible being.
03-01-2018T19:40:23,QiblitheSandwing,@Bgrmystr2 That's why I said from afar
03-01-2018T19:40:24,SageSaga,when i make a pact with the dark lord yes i am at some fault but what the dark lord uses by body for without my permission im not completely at fault for
03-01-2018T19:40:36,unsteddyphoenix,Debatable
03-01-2018T19:40:36,zanAspera,"Though it may be at Trace's behest, it is Nora's spell"
03-01-2018T19:40:38,QiblitheSandwing,@Twokinds What's your opinion on http://www.indiedb.com/games/twokinds-online
03-01-2018T19:40:42,ZizzoGaming,Ephemural did nothing wrong
03-01-2018T19:41:03,QiblitheSandwing,"Wait, you're joking right?"
03-01-2018T19:41:03,unsteddyphoenix,"""I didnt kill all those people! My death robot that I built did!"""
03-01-2018T19:41:34,QiblitheSandwing,Neutral was just interested in keeping the Keidran alive and balance no matter the cost
03-01-2018T19:41:39,DJSylveon,Why else would you build a robot?
03-01-2018T19:41:48,Ordithus,"To cook eggs, DJ."
03-01-2018T19:41:50,QiblitheSandwing,"that's kind of wrong, depending on your point of view"
03-01-2018T19:41:52,Dadrobit,I can think of a few reasons....
03-01-2018T19:41:58,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, to do good things, Sylv?"
03-01-2018T19:42:08,TheBeckoner,S E X B O T
03-01-2018T19:42:17,KuroganeWatanoshi,wait. there is a TwoKinds game?
03-01-2018T19:42:17,LeKnightWolf,such silly things as making a switch in gender is nothing but disintigrating casts the owner not in the line of evil or ill intended if there was a rule set in place that she had to follow as Trace is grandmaster
03-01-2018T19:42:25,zanAspera,Are you holding gods to your mortal morality?
03-01-2018T19:42:26,Bgrmystr2,Lol beck. Many.. good things.
03-01-2018T19:42:36,QiblitheSandwing,@Twokinds Would you ever try to make 3D models of any of the characters?

03-01-2018T19:43:40,MetalAppleSauce,I'm still not used to seeing flora entirely orange
03-01-2018T19:43:48,MviluUatusun,"Oh, that reminds me.  The drawing I mentioned a couple of weeks ago is almost ready.  I'll be uploading it to my pages as soon as the artist gives me the go ahead."
03-01-2018T19:43:52,MuonNeutrino,"i noticed that tom's gone to drawing flora's stripes with smooth edges again rather than the bumpy/wiggly edges he used to do, i wonder why"
03-01-2018T19:44:05,Dadrobit,Probably easier.
03-01-2018T19:44:06,QiblitheSandwing,@WanderOfTheVoid Did you just try to bump my Question? XD He probably ignored it for a reason
03-01-2018T19:44:15,MviluUatusun,"Darn it, Dad.  I was going to say that.  LOL."
03-01-2018T19:44:22,zanAspera,I sure hope TwoKinds online got permission.   Looks like fun if they do

03-01-2018T19:44:54,NeonMitsumi,"@zanAspera The guy was at the comic con and had decent talk with Tom, from what I've heard"
03-01-2018T19:44:56,Bgrmystr2,I don't use iTunes.
03-01-2018T19:45:04,MviluUatusun,"Not I, German.  I haven't seen it yet."
03-01-2018T19:45:09,Twokinds,"The reason is that my style has kinda shifted more to cartoony, and I feel solid stripes just look nicer this way"

03-01-2018T22:36:57,TheBeckoner,I like Lynn
03-01-2018T22:37:04,MidnightBlue78,"like you know, that thing :3"
03-01-2018T22:37:07,unsteddyphoenix,Lynn isnt good
03-01-2018T22:37:15,unsteddyphoenix,He's a bureaucrat
03-01-2018T22:37:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so was hermes
03-01-2018T22:37:43,Twokinds,He'a a good bureaucrat
03-01-2018T22:37:47,Dadrobit,How do you think he got so good at bureaucracy?
03-01-2018T22:37:54,Dadrobit,By being in the system
03-01-2018T22:38:02,Dadrobit,At the highst level
03-01-2018T22:38:06,Dadrobit,highest*
03-01-2018T22:38:07,Twokinds,"If I have Raine say ""Natani, was it?"" do you understand what she means?"
03-01-2018T22:38:20,Dadrobit,Yes
03-01-2018T22:38:22,Twokinds,"I'm reading over my script and now I'm like ""is that how people talk?"""
03-01-2018T22:38:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
03-01-2018T22:38:25,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's a common phrase.
03-01-2018T22:38:47,TheBeckoner,Ahh took me way too long to read that correctly
03-01-2018T22:38:54,Ordithus,"I am human.  I do human things.  I flab mouth parts and say ""Natani, was it?"""
03-01-2018T22:38:55,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, I think so"
03-01-2018T22:38:55,TheBeckoner,But it makes sense
03-01-2018T22:39:22,unsteddyphoenix,"The best bureaucrats dont become the leaders, too high profile."
03-01-2018T22:40:37,Dadrobit,He was already a leader. His abilities in making documents in triplicate came from trial by fire

03-01-2018T22:41:53,unsteddyphoenix,Everything you're saying is making it even less convincing.
03-01-2018T22:42:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,don't be stubborn unsteady just accept that fact that lynn's got game
03-01-2018T22:43:02,unsteddyphoenix,He literally is the only person in tk who has no game.

03-01-2018T23:00:22,Twokinds,Jeez I have to very carefully change all the 2017s to 2018
03-01-2018T23:00:50,BadFoMo,What do you mean?
03-01-2018T23:00:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gonna take a whole year to get used to writing 2018 now
03-01-2018T23:00:58,Dadrobit,How many 2017's have you made in 4 days?
03-01-2018T23:01:30,unsteddyphoenix,Change it to 2016 for the bamboozle
03-01-2018T23:01:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that would be a rough bamboozle
03-01-2018T23:04:33,Twokinds,Only one so far
03-01-2018T23:04:42,Twokinds,But I'm sure I'll slip up more as time goes on.
03-01-2018T23:05:05,Twokinds,"Then again, I like 2018 as a number better than 2017 so it shouldn't be too hard."
03-01-2018T23:05:10,Twokinds,I didn't like 2007 either.
03-01-2018T23:05:14,Twokinds,Such an awkward number.
03-01-2018T23:05:27,Bgrmystr2,7 is so much easier to write than 8 though
03-01-2018T23:05:35,Bgrmystr2,it's just two lines
03-01-2018T23:05:40,Bgrmystr2,"I hated 8, still do"
03-01-2018T23:05:40,unsteddyphoenix,Not a fan of 7's?
03-01-2018T23:05:46,Dadrobit,8 is more fun
03-01-2018T23:05:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I like 7
03-01-2018T23:05:49,unsteddyphoenix,Did hear some things about what it did to 9...
03-01-2018T23:05:54,Ordithus,No one likes 9
03-01-2018T23:06:13,TheBeckoner,8 is just upright infinity

03-01-2018T23:24:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't get it
03-01-2018T23:24:16,Bgrmystr2,good :v
03-01-2018T23:26:04,MidnightBlue78,"So, Trace can shapeshift?"
03-01-2018T23:26:49,Ordithus,We haven't seen him do so.  He turned Mary Keidran once.  That was a lark...
03-01-2018T23:26:58,unsteddyphoenix,No he cant
03-01-2018T23:27:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he can turn others but not himself
03-01-2018T23:27:28,MidnightBlue78,"ah,ok"
03-01-2018T23:27:32,unsteddyphoenix,But the other option is that humans and keidran can SOMEHOW breed now.
03-01-2018T23:27:38,unsteddyphoenix,"And honestly, what are the odds of that?"
03-01-2018T23:28:23,Ordithus,Sythe needs to read the comic.  He'd know then.
03-01-2018T23:29:03,Bgrmystr2,"If trace can shapeshift, we don't know it. But the fact that he can use imperfect transformation on others, that means he can also use it on himself"
03-01-2018T23:29:23,Bgrmystr2,no way to know if he can turn himself back though
03-01-2018T23:29:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,someone needs to let the TK people know that their actions have consequences
03-01-2018T23:29:34,Bgrmystr2,isn't that the point of the comic?
03-01-2018T23:29:40,Bgrmystr2,that they find out as such?
03-01-2018T23:29:51,unsteddyphoenix,Consequences: the webcomic
03-01-2018T23:29:54,CrRAR,what?

03-01-2018T23:30:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that sounds like hell
03-01-2018T23:30:28,MidnightBlue78,human/keidran ones

03-01-2018T23:38:42,unsteddyphoenix,"There's no such place as ""canada"""
03-01-2018T23:39:08,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, cuz noone in the world is a Canadin."
03-01-2018T23:39:24,Bgrmystr2,"there's only one place a Canadian can be from, and that's Canadia."
03-01-2018T23:39:55,Bgrmystr2,"Well, they could be Canadans, I'm not quite sure."
03-01-2018T23:40:00,Bgrmystr2,Not that they exist.
03-01-2018T23:41:33,CrRAR,lol
