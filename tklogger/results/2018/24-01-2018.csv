24-01-2018T00:00:52,Dadrobit,Patience is huge for recording audio
24-01-2018T00:01:03,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds impossible if you just wanted the isolated sound
24-01-2018T00:01:17,Dadrobit,Shotgun mics are the tits
24-01-2018T00:01:43,Dadrobit,"Still get background noise if it's loud enough, but directional mics are Godsends."
24-01-2018T00:02:01,Unenlagia,That they are
24-01-2018T00:02:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, borrowed one from my uni for that, was pretty fun to use"

24-01-2018T00:06:13,Char89TheCharizard,"I'm curious about one thing though, how did slavery started in the Twokinds universe?"
24-01-2018T00:07:17,Unenlagia,"Probably the same as ours, one tribe dominated the other. Other tribes wanted labor so the conquered tribe was sold off."
24-01-2018T00:07:20,unsteddyphoenix,Depends on how many parallels twokinds draws from reality
24-01-2018T00:07:25,Aviark,Tom is a Korean in the US and wanted to spread a message about discrimination
24-01-2018T00:08:12,unsteddyphoenix,If I had to guess i'd say the wolves invented it and humans/other keidran adopted it.
24-01-2018T00:08:13,Char89TheCharizard,does that make Markplier Korean as well? honestly I never took Mark for one
24-01-2018T00:08:26,unsteddyphoenix,No he's spanish
24-01-2018T00:08:55,Char89TheCharizard,"now I'm confused. Those two are brothers, aren't they?"
24-01-2018T00:09:06,Kynum,I think he's messing with you.
24-01-2018T00:09:22,Dadrobit,Mark is clearly Russian.
24-01-2018T00:09:56,Kynum,"Nah, he's from Mordor."
24-01-2018T00:10:40,Unenlagia,"He is actually 1/4 squirrel, that is why he is King."
24-01-2018T00:10:46,InTheLionsDen,He is from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse
24-01-2018T00:11:36,unsteddyphoenix,"He's from west Philadelphia, born and raised."
24-01-2018T00:11:55,Kynum,do they have sandworms?
24-01-2018T00:12:52,Char89TheCharizard,oh don't do the Fresh Prince thing on me
24-01-2018T00:13:21,Unenlagia,"inhales, then says nothing"
24-01-2018T00:13:29,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
24-01-2018T00:13:50,unsteddyphoenix,I will reference the fresh prince at ANY time for ANY reason.

24-01-2018T00:20:38,RedDeath2018,I wasn’t even born yet when that posted
24-01-2018T00:20:41,Unenlagia,Selective breeding for desirable traits was indeed a thing.
24-01-2018T00:20:57,Dadrobit,"Oh certainly, Tom himself said anything prior to 2007 is questionable at best."
24-01-2018T00:21:06,Unenlagia,"Well, now I feel old."
24-01-2018T00:21:09,unsteddyphoenix,"I wonder if Keidran selectively bred themselves, to get more $$$ from humans"

24-01-2018T00:21:11,Dadrobit,Red is a wee lad
24-01-2018T00:21:25,Walphin,I was two when that was posted

24-01-2018T00:22:25,RedDeath2018,Lol I was gonna add more
24-01-2018T00:22:27,Unenlagia,Kat is a mutt
24-01-2018T00:22:45,RedDeath2018,Wow
24-01-2018T00:22:50,RedDeath2018,Just wow
24-01-2018T00:23:04,unsteddyphoenix,Very rude
24-01-2018T00:23:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Did Kat have like, pure parents though?"
24-01-2018T00:23:21,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like I remember someone saying that
24-01-2018T00:23:27,RedDeath2018,Yea she did
24-01-2018T00:23:44,unsteddyphoenix,Were you born when it was said? :thinking:
24-01-2018T00:23:44,RedDeath2018,Don’t you remember the “girl talk”
24-01-2018T00:23:58,Unenlagia,I'll look that up.
24-01-2018T00:24:09,Dadrobit,"IIRC, she was bred for looks, but I don't think much was said beyond her parents being mixed ""ethnicities"" as Tom put it."
24-01-2018T00:24:25,RedDeath2018,Yea
24-01-2018T00:24:47,RedDeath2018,Then nat was complaining about her girl parts
24-01-2018T00:25:02,RedDeath2018,That part got weird
24-01-2018T00:25:28,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah agreed girls have cooties

24-01-2018T00:26:24,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, considering mixed keidran dont breed well, I suppose by default there cant be too much chimera-ing"
24-01-2018T00:26:25,RedDeath2018,And I’m a guy so yea it’s kinda weird for me
24-01-2018T00:26:35,Bgrmystr2,"I'm also a guy, and I don't think it's weird at all."
24-01-2018T00:26:40,Bgrmystr2,I think you're just weird.

24-01-2018T00:27:32,Dadrobit,That has... nothing to do with that conversation....
24-01-2018T00:27:41,Bgrmystr2,XD right
24-01-2018T00:27:50,Unenlagia,Found it. Kat is the result of generations of selective breeding across keidran subspecies.
24-01-2018T00:28:14,RedDeath2018,I mean like I find it weird because I respect people’s privacy
24-01-2018T00:28:16,unsteddyphoenix,Is that on the forums?
24-01-2018T00:28:28,Unenlagia,Page 742

24-01-2018T00:32:13,unsteddyphoenix,Does it actually specify she was bred across multiple subspecies on this page?
24-01-2018T00:33:01,Dadrobit,"""There's a reason why canines and felines aren't often bred together."""
24-01-2018T00:33:17,unsteddyphoenix,That could refer to just her parents though
24-01-2018T00:33:19,Dadrobit,That's it
24-01-2018T00:33:50,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, I guess ""2"" is multiple so fair."
24-01-2018T00:33:54,Unenlagia,"She was bred for aesthetics. ""As were my parents, and theirs, and so on."""

24-01-2018T00:34:39,unsteddyphoenix,Since I feel like I read something about that once

24-01-2018T00:36:09,Dadrobit,"Though honestly, Kat is a terrible product if you think about it."
24-01-2018T00:36:09,unsteddyphoenix,Really paints the slave trade in a bad light
24-01-2018T00:36:24,unsteddyphoenix,...
24-01-2018T00:36:36,unsteddyphoenix,...unsure where you're going with this...
24-01-2018T00:36:59,Dadrobit,Short-lived AND you can't breed it on your own?
24-01-2018T00:37:11,Dadrobit,Just get a sexy dog or a sexy cat
24-01-2018T00:37:14,Unenlagia,*cough* Mules *cough*
24-01-2018T00:38:02,Dadrobit,Mules are much cheaper than horses
24-01-2018T00:38:17,Unenlagia,"Considering how domesticated she is, the point might have been to have an aesthetically pleasing housemaid."
24-01-2018T00:38:21,unsteddyphoenix,Kat wouldve probably been very expensive
24-01-2018T00:38:36,Bgrmystr2,We already know what purpose Kat was bred for lol

24-01-2018T00:40:15,Dadrobit,Kat was probably expensive for Roderick. But he probably sold her at a good loss to Eric once he found out she was damaged goods.
24-01-2018T00:40:35,unsteddyphoenix,Wasnt she bred within their family?
24-01-2018T00:40:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, wasnt Erics fam the one who bred her."
24-01-2018T00:40:46,Bgrmystr2,I don't think so?
24-01-2018T00:40:48,Dadrobit,... I don't actually know?
24-01-2018T00:40:52,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall that being a thing
24-01-2018T00:40:59,Unenlagia,"That seemed to be the implication, but I can't recall it being directly said"
24-01-2018T00:41:05,Dadrobit,I don't think it was ever specified.
24-01-2018T00:41:12,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe I imagined that
24-01-2018T00:41:16,Dadrobit,Just that Eric bought her from Roderick
24-01-2018T00:41:24,Bgrmystr2,"Was that specified, Dadro?"
24-01-2018T00:41:28,Dadrobit,Yes

24-01-2018T00:48:19,Unenlagia,"Related: in the ""Meeting Maeve"" entry, that she has ""probably a little"" bit of Snow Leopard in her genetics. If canonical, it shows that she's not aware of what breeds her relatives were, but she knows why they were bred."

24-01-2018T01:34:14,RedDeath2018,Ima teen
24-01-2018T01:34:17,Unenlagia,Seems like a permanent solution to a temporary problem
24-01-2018T01:34:26,TheBeckoner,teen = kid. No?
24-01-2018T01:34:30,unsteddyphoenix,This is why none of my kids will have internet freedom until 16 at least
24-01-2018T01:34:38,TheBeckoner,lol
24-01-2018T01:34:38,RedDeath2018,Lol
24-01-2018T01:34:39,Dadrobit,Solid plan
24-01-2018T01:34:50,unsteddyphoenix,"Noone wants kids online, and no kid should be online."
24-01-2018T01:34:57,Twokinds,But...
24-01-2018T01:34:59,Dadrobit,I'm so glad I didn't have internet when I was a young teen
24-01-2018T01:34:59,Twokinds,But...
24-01-2018T01:35:03,TheBeckoner,Heck just keep em in the basement till like 25
24-01-2018T01:35:08,RedDeath2018,But you’ll allow twokinds right
24-01-2018T01:35:14,unsteddyphoenix,NO.
24-01-2018T01:35:18,Twokinds,I signed up for Twokind's first url when I was 13
24-01-2018T01:35:18,unsteddyphoenix,NO REVENUE FOR TOM &gt;:(

24-01-2018T01:35:44,Bgrmystr2,"once you are a teenager, you're probably still a kid, but you're not a child anymore."
24-01-2018T01:35:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, we know, we saw Red's first outfit..."
24-01-2018T01:35:47,MidnightBlue78,"Tom, was browsing the web at a very young age"
24-01-2018T01:35:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Cmon, ofc."
24-01-2018T01:35:54,RedDeath2018,👋
24-01-2018T01:36:01,TheBeckoner,It more of knowing how to behave than just age though.
24-01-2018T01:36:03,MidnightBlue78,Tom was the shit
24-01-2018T01:36:05,RedDeath2018,That’s for a high five

24-01-2018T01:36:15,Bgrmystr2,"that's a wave, Red."
24-01-2018T01:36:18,Bgrmystr2,Not a high five.
24-01-2018T01:36:29,TheBeckoner,A gay high five maybe
24-01-2018T01:36:32,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/23/ That's not edgy at all...
24-01-2018T01:36:41,Dadrobit,o/ Azuma

24-01-2018T01:37:12,unsteddyphoenix,I want to see that outfit remastered one day
24-01-2018T01:37:17,MidnightBlue78,I like Keith's legs in that panel
24-01-2018T01:37:29,Dadrobit,I've considered a suggestion slot for it
24-01-2018T01:37:31,RedDeath2018,🔪👱🏻‍♂️
24-01-2018T01:37:46,RedDeath2018,Cause I’m not gay
24-01-2018T01:37:51,Dadrobit,Brh
24-01-2018T01:37:53,Dadrobit,Bruh
24-01-2018T01:38:08,TheBeckoner,Keith used too have very very wide hips..
24-01-2018T01:38:18,Dadrobit,Because Keith is a girl
24-01-2018T01:38:22,Dadrobit,Dontcha know?
24-01-2018T01:38:30,TheBeckoner,woa ur right
24-01-2018T01:38:39,RedDeath2018,he is a girl when nat’s around
24-01-2018T01:38:48,TheBeckoner,But he probably is.
24-01-2018T01:38:55,RedDeath2018,Cause then he gets all girly and all that
24-01-2018T01:39:08,Dadrobit,[06:02:16] &lt;Tom&gt;	Laura x Keith is lesbians.
24-01-2018T01:39:10,Dadrobit,[06:02:46] &lt;Tom&gt;	Because Keith is a girl.
24-01-2018T01:39:18,Dadrobit,Canon
24-01-2018T01:39:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, we all knew that already"
24-01-2018T01:40:15,RedDeath2018,"Well Tom, you happy. Keith is now a trans gay lesbian or whatever"
24-01-2018T01:40:17,TheBeckoner,And Tom said that EVERYTHING is canon so its pretty much confirmed.
24-01-2018T01:40:22,Dadrobit,"And that was 2009, so totally within canon timelines"
24-01-2018T01:40:27,Unenlagia,Even the sleepover
24-01-2018T01:40:58,unsteddyphoenix,That was past the canon singularity
24-01-2018T01:41:16,Dadrobit,Exactly
24-01-2018T01:42:08,TheBeckoner,Ooh memory has randomly reminded me of Tit and Tat. Cant forget them...

24-01-2018T01:42:29,RedDeath2018,Nat was wrong
24-01-2018T01:42:41,RedDeath2018,It is canon
24-01-2018T01:43:24,RedDeath2018,Mind blown
24-01-2018T01:44:33,RedDeath2018,:ptv-shock:
24-01-2018T01:46:19,Bgrmystr2,Twokinds characters are not actually privy to everything Tom says.

24-01-2018T01:49:45,Bgrmystr2,gnight Beck
24-01-2018T01:50:02,RedDeath2018,but I meant to sent it as one not a link to it
24-01-2018T01:50:07,Bgrmystr2,I don't have any school at all anymore :V
24-01-2018T01:50:16,Bgrmystr2,you can't put gifs in chat from links
24-01-2018T01:50:18,Bgrmystr2,that's not how it works
24-01-2018T01:50:32,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, most websites do not work like that"
24-01-2018T01:50:34,Dadrobit,:D I love classes. Honestly the best part of the day. I get to spend several hours with experienced experts doing a thing that I love to do! :D
24-01-2018T01:51:07,Bgrmystr2,"that's not exactly the same though, Dadro. You're going for what you want to do"
24-01-2018T01:51:08,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-01-2018T01:51:11,Bgrmystr2,of course you like them
24-01-2018T01:51:16,Dadrobit,I might re-take my Sound Design 3 next semester just for giggles as long as time permits.
24-01-2018T01:51:32,RedDeath2018,Hey tom did you go to an art school my mom is thinking about putting me in one since I draw decently
24-01-2018T01:51:48,Bgrmystr2,"if there were classes for like.. being lazy and sleeping, or just playing video games all day, or watching TV, then yeah lots of ppl would like classes"
24-01-2018T01:51:52,Bgrmystr2,and yeah he went to art school
24-01-2018T01:51:56,Dadrobit,"I s'pose. Never understood people outright HATING school though. Parts sucked for sure, but it's not allllll terrible."
24-01-2018T01:51:57,Bgrmystr2,I don't know much more besides that
24-01-2018T01:52:09,Bgrmystr2,because school teaches you shit you don't use ever
24-01-2018T01:52:15,Bgrmystr2,"also, teachers don't give a shit"
24-01-2018T01:52:31,Bgrmystr2,most of em don't care if you pass or fail
24-01-2018T01:52:43,Dadrobit,I used Geometry to calculate Reni's height before she was actually shown in comic if that counts?
24-01-2018T01:52:59,RedDeath2018,I do analytical grammar so I know how that is
24-01-2018T01:53:08,Bgrmystr2,"lol, not really, I mean use it on a daily basis"
24-01-2018T01:53:24,Dadrobit,"As a son and grandson of teachers, an overwhelming majority of teachers want their kids to pass."
24-01-2018T01:53:53,Bgrmystr2,"my mother had honor's calculus in high school, and she never uses it."
24-01-2018T01:54:09,Bgrmystr2,"I think that's just because of where you are, Dadro"
24-01-2018T01:54:15,Bgrmystr2,"around here, noone does."
24-01-2018T01:54:21,Bgrmystr2,noone really cares
24-01-2018T01:54:24,Dadrobit,"Like every person in my previous 2 generations are all teachers, and we all hang out with teacher friends, and they all genuinely want their kids to pass."
24-01-2018T01:54:36,Bgrmystr2,"and where I used to live, in GA, people were pretty indifferent"
24-01-2018T01:54:40,Dadrobit,Even the dickhead kids
24-01-2018T01:55:00,Bgrmystr2,It must be nice to actually have schools that have teachers that wish for anything other than a paycheck.
24-01-2018T01:55:06,Bgrmystr2,I'd give to go there.
24-01-2018T01:55:21,RedDeath2018,The reason I asked if tom went is cause there is just one art school where I live and my dad says that drawing isn’t very focused on and say I would be disipointed and a waste of my money
24-01-2018T01:55:40,Dadrobit,"AZ is 43rd in the country lol, well below GA."
24-01-2018T01:55:45,RedDeath2018,Btw I live in Madison Alabama so yea
24-01-2018T01:55:45,Dadrobit,You probably don't
24-01-2018T01:56:24,Bgrmystr2,"you want to go to a quality art school, Red"
24-01-2018T01:56:27,Bgrmystr2,not just a local one
24-01-2018T01:56:35,Dadrobit,And paychecks suck out here. My father's pay was frozen for something like 9 years. Not cool.
24-01-2018T01:56:36,Bgrmystr2,don't go to one just cuz it's convenient
24-01-2018T01:57:03,RedDeath2018,Ima pull the school up real quick hold on
24-01-2018T01:57:34,Dadrobit,"Red, draw on your own, an hour a day, of your own volition, for a year. If you can't do that, art school will not do you any favors."
24-01-2018T01:57:40,Bgrmystr2,"Well, Dadro, I can safely say if you're doin better than Louisiana"
24-01-2018T01:58:12,Dadrobit,"The important thing is not skill, it's perseverance."
24-01-2018T01:58:33,Bgrmystr2,"Worst public school system in the country, 2016"
24-01-2018T01:58:50,Bgrmystr2,"49th, for 2 years straight"
24-01-2018T01:58:55,Dadrobit,k-12 we're 47th lol

24-01-2018T02:00:36,Twokinds,I set my assistant to tell me to get to work. Now it keeps telling me to get to work. I'm feeling very judged.
24-01-2018T02:00:50,RedDeath2018,Lol
24-01-2018T02:00:51,Bgrmystr2,"You did that to yourself, Tom xD"
24-01-2018T02:00:57,Bgrmystr2,You should probably listen to it
24-01-2018T02:01:06,Dadrobit,"Red, your pencil is 2 inches away from your hand though."
24-01-2018T02:01:12,RedDeath2018,A stream right now
24-01-2018T02:01:25,RedDeath2018,That’s crazy
24-01-2018T02:01:37,Bgrmystr2,what are you talking about lol
24-01-2018T02:01:44,MidnightBlue78,You gotta be kidding me
24-01-2018T02:01:56,RedDeath2018,What does tom mean get to work
24-01-2018T02:02:18,RedDeath2018,I’m in two conversations
24-01-2018T02:02:20,MidnightBlue78,"I don't know, but I hope he ignores it"
24-01-2018T02:02:28,unsteddyphoenix,How DARE it
24-01-2018T02:02:33,Bgrmystr2,"If he did, we wouldn't have twokinds."
24-01-2018T02:02:43,Bgrmystr2,I hope he doesn't ignore it.
24-01-2018T02:03:19,RedDeath2018,Well tom needs a break to
24-01-2018T02:03:25,Bgrmystr2,"""work"" doesn't mean stream, it just means do somethin. xD"
24-01-2018T02:03:32,RedDeath2018,Ohhhhh
24-01-2018T02:03:42,Bgrmystr2,why would you think it meant stream?
24-01-2018T02:03:47,MidnightBlue78,tomorrow is another day
24-01-2018T02:03:51,Bgrmystr2,"he doesn't stream everything he does, dude"
24-01-2018T02:03:54,RedDeath2018,I wonder if he ever get sick bored of drawing
24-01-2018T02:04:04,MidnightBlue78,"Well, he has streamed really late before"
24-01-2018T02:04:07,RedDeath2018,And I know that
24-01-2018T02:04:13,Bgrmystr2,starting at 1am though..?
24-01-2018T02:04:16,Bgrmystr2,don't think so
24-01-2018T02:04:20,Dadrobit,"""$75 a month plus a $30 art pack."" Literally more expensive than my tuition for a semester and this is for kiddos."
24-01-2018T02:04:24,MidnightBlue78,Oh yes he has
24-01-2018T02:04:28,Bgrmystr2,"or rather, 2am, Eastern"

24-01-2018T03:09:49,Dadrobit,"Lotsa malicious folks out there. I'm not one of them, but there are at least 15 other people in this chat alone THAT WE KNOW OF that have access to exactly the same information as I have."
24-01-2018T03:10:13,RedDeath2018,Are u a white hat too
24-01-2018T03:10:20,Dadrobit,"Protecting yourself (and by extension, those around you) is very serious stuff mate."

24-01-2018T13:14:41,Twokinds,byyyyyyyyyyye
24-01-2018T13:15:22,RedDeath2018,Anyone like football
24-01-2018T13:15:47,RedDeath2018,American football
24-01-2018T13:18:24,Twokinds,"I have watched some sportball very rarely, but I can't say I follow it."
24-01-2018T13:18:43,Twokinds,"I understand the rules and how it's played, and that's about it."
24-01-2018T13:18:58,Unenlagia,Gotta love that Handegg
24-01-2018T13:19:25,RedDeath2018,I just watch highlights in the nfl but most of my football knowledge is from the team I’m in
24-01-2018T13:28:54,Dadrobit,"Pffft, my online class powerpoint instructor just mentioned listening to music through Limewire. Dated the class just a bit there lol."
24-01-2018T13:29:50,Dadrobit,"""Many of you probably use MySpace."""
24-01-2018T13:29:53,Dadrobit,GG
24-01-2018T13:30:01,RedDeath2018,My space is dead
24-01-2018T13:31:45,Dadrobit,You got that backwards actually. MySpace is very much still a thing. Limewire died about 8 years ago.
24-01-2018T13:38:09,RedDeath2018,What is limewire
24-01-2018T13:45:29,Dadrobit,"It was a torrent site known for music downloads. Think The PirateBay, but pretty much focused on music."
24-01-2018T13:47:32,Dadrobit,Though music was not the only thing on it.
24-01-2018T14:08:33,Twokinds,"Ah, limewire"
24-01-2018T14:08:57,Twokinds,"You pick a file that looks like it's about the right size, wait however long it takes, and hope it's actually what it claims to be once it's done."
24-01-2018T14:09:52,Azumachan,The Chrome Extension of Mega is neat and fast
24-01-2018T14:09:57,Azumachan,50GB free
24-01-2018T14:15:52,qwe304,I use that for my bigger files
24-01-2018T14:16:51,TheBeckoner,I remember using 4shared to get apk's and music...Is 4shared a thing still?
24-01-2018T14:21:37,RedDeath2018,I guess it was an amazing gift back the
24-01-2018T14:21:44,RedDeath2018,Then*
24-01-2018T14:22:26,RedDeath2018,No there iTunes and google play
24-01-2018T14:23:55,RedDeath2018,Now*
24-01-2018T14:24:57,Bgrmystr2,"Limewire wasn't used for legitimate uses primarily though, like iTunes and google play"
24-01-2018T14:25:47,RedDeath2018,Oh
24-01-2018T14:26:04,Bgrmystr2,"The latter two, and other things like it, came about with their really cheap music purchasing because of rampant downloading of music via torrents and other programs like Limewire"
24-01-2018T14:26:10,Bgrmystr2,Napster was another
24-01-2018T14:26:36,Bgrmystr2,"people didn't really purchase music cds, they only wanted one song"
24-01-2018T14:26:55,RedDeath2018,Dude you just described me
24-01-2018T14:27:28,Bgrmystr2,"congratulations, you are one in the hundreds of millions that did the same lol"
24-01-2018T14:28:14,RedDeath2018,Well let’s just say I’m more into old things like the NES and N74
24-01-2018T14:28:20,RedDeath2018,N64
24-01-2018T14:28:24,TheBeckoner,Basically hundreds of millions (billions now?) of internet pirates.
24-01-2018T14:28:51,RedDeath2018,Illegal activity is a new trend
24-01-2018T14:28:55,Bgrmystr2,"Online became a thing, where a fraction of a doller can pay for a single song, or pay a bit of a cheaper price and get the whole cd (instead of paying for each track individually)"
24-01-2018T14:29:00,Bgrmystr2,it's not a new trent
24-01-2018T14:29:03,Bgrmystr2,trend* even
24-01-2018T14:29:13,Bgrmystr2,it's been around for thousands of years.
24-01-2018T14:29:20,Bgrmystr2,not even remotely new
24-01-2018T14:29:48,Bgrmystr2,"xD People doin things they're not supposed to do. Fuck, even animals do that."
24-01-2018T14:31:16,Dadrobit,"Heading into class, be back in a couple hours. Have a good one y'all."
24-01-2018T14:31:19,TheBeckoner,I mean bees are born breaking the rules lol
24-01-2018T14:31:25,TheBeckoner,See yah robit GL

24-01-2018T14:32:50,TheBeckoner,Milk bees? y/n
24-01-2018T14:33:32,Bgrmystr2,You ask that as if I have any intention of being anywhere close to bees.
24-01-2018T14:34:02,TheBeckoner,Someday someone will milk my bees...
24-01-2018T14:34:05,Bgrmystr2,"also, that's not possible, they aren't cows."
24-01-2018T14:34:12,Bgrmystr2,Try cows.
24-01-2018T14:34:34,Bgrmystr2,Less thance of stung. More than 0% chance of succeed based on capability.
24-01-2018T14:34:36,TheBeckoner,I actually had a beehive at one point them little things make a ton of honey
24-01-2018T14:34:43,Bgrmystr2,yeah

24-01-2018T14:35:19,TheBeckoner,from*
24-01-2018T14:35:35,TheBeckoner,"Bad thing is, is that most of it fermented before we could use it."
24-01-2018T14:36:00,TheBeckoner,"Still eatable, but its full of alcohol and yeast now."
24-01-2018T14:36:15,TheBeckoner,Kinda tatses weird that way
24-01-2018T14:42:55,Bgrmystr2,gotta be quick about it lol
24-01-2018T14:45:20,TheBeckoner,"""Hey guys wanna come over and guzzle like 6 gallons of honey?"""
24-01-2018T14:45:46,RedDeath2018,srry was playin ROS with my friend

24-01-2018T16:30:29,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Wonder what happened with Tom. It doesn't usually take this long to set up for stream.
24-01-2018T16:30:48,TheFDdriver,same here
24-01-2018T16:30:55,TheFDdriver,what happened?
24-01-2018T16:30:57,RedDeath2018,probably really hungry
24-01-2018T16:31:08,RedDeath2018,so he is eatin
24-01-2018T16:31:15,Bgrmystr2,"why would you ask, FD? Like anyone here know xD"
24-01-2018T16:31:32,RedDeath2018,but being water boy is fun
24-01-2018T16:31:56,RedDeath2018,i was the best waterboy according to all the guys

24-01-2018T16:33:57,Bgrmystr2,"hey, if they're not all over you, then you're doin something wrong"
24-01-2018T16:34:12,TheFDdriver,XD
24-01-2018T16:34:17,Bgrmystr2,"obviously, since that's how movies depict football cheerleaders, right? :v"

24-01-2018T16:35:53,TheBeckoner,"It's there, don't you see?"
24-01-2018T16:36:08,Bgrmystr2,"Maybe you should check back later, just like the thing says on it."
24-01-2018T16:36:09,Mustanglvr007,It's offline
24-01-2018T16:36:34,Mustanglvr007,"Meh, I'm coming back when I get the notification"

24-01-2018T16:43:57,RedDeath2018,watch the video to see really how to do it
24-01-2018T16:44:14,RedDeath2018,its fun once you learn it
24-01-2018T16:44:15,TheFDdriver,ok

24-01-2018T16:46:01,RedDeath2018,i hated it
24-01-2018T16:46:39,RedDeath2018,there is your joke that you guys were asking for last night
24-01-2018T16:47:02,TheFDdriver,lol
24-01-2018T16:47:10,Bgrmystr2,was that supposed to be a joke?
24-01-2018T16:47:15,Bgrmystr2,sounds like reality to me :u
24-01-2018T16:47:20,RedDeath2018,lol
24-01-2018T16:47:35,RedDeath2018,im just reeally bored

24-01-2018T16:54:26,RedDeath2018,backlog? what does that mean
24-01-2018T16:54:35,TheFDdriver,no idea
24-01-2018T16:54:40,Azumachan,create a few pages ahead of time
24-01-2018T16:54:51,RedDeath2018,oh
24-01-2018T16:55:00,RedDeath2018,so this weekend huh
24-01-2018T16:55:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
24-01-2018T16:55:15,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, so he won't be working on the page immediately before he posts it"
24-01-2018T16:55:25,Bgrmystr2,He'll already have pages done
24-01-2018T16:55:35,RedDeath2018,is there gonna be a stream tommorow and sunday
24-01-2018T16:55:35,Bgrmystr2,and they'll go up automatically on time
24-01-2018T16:55:41,RedDeath2018,ok
24-01-2018T16:55:53,Bgrmystr2,backlogs are for just in case something bad happens
24-01-2018T16:55:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tommorow will most likely be a nora card
24-01-2018T16:56:02,Bgrmystr2,like most likely
24-01-2018T16:56:02,RedDeath2018,oh
24-01-2018T16:56:07,TheFDdriver,yep
24-01-2018T16:56:16,Bgrmystr2,and sunday is the patreon stream so that's a given
24-01-2018T16:56:35,RedDeath2018,i hope its like florajitus that was fun

24-01-2018T16:57:21,TheFDdriver,damm it
24-01-2018T16:57:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,$10 a month
24-01-2018T16:57:29,TheBeckoner,Language sir.
24-01-2018T16:58:07,TheFDdriver,is my 2nd or my 1st time
24-01-2018T16:58:24,Bgrmystr2,"His language passes, Beck. You should be getting onto him about his spelling."
24-01-2018T16:58:30,Bgrmystr2,:P
24-01-2018T16:58:36,TheBeckoner,Hmm
24-01-2018T16:58:37,TheFDdriver,true
24-01-2018T16:58:41,TheBeckoner,You're right.
24-01-2018T16:58:56,TheFDdriver,i suck at spelling
24-01-2018T16:59:07,Bgrmystr2,Should fix that.
24-01-2018T16:59:20,TheFDdriver,i am
24-01-2018T16:59:23,Bgrmystr2,Good.
24-01-2018T16:59:24,RedDeath2018,never mind
24-01-2018T17:00:17,TheFDdriver,should i rely on the auto-translator?
24-01-2018T17:00:23,TheFDdriver,for now?
24-01-2018T17:00:42,Bgrmystr2,those things are pretty horrible
24-01-2018T17:00:48,Bgrmystr2,dunno why you would ever want that
24-01-2018T17:01:01,TheFDdriver,I dunno
24-01-2018T17:01:11,RedDeath2018,Azumachan i named https://picarto.tv/Twokinds#
24-01-2018T17:01:14,Bgrmystr2,even children with no concept of their primary language speak better than translators
24-01-2018T17:01:22,RedDeath2018,florajitus
24-01-2018T17:02:17,RedDeath2018,because when flora derped i said that it was a disease called florajitus
24-01-2018T17:02:37,TheFDdriver,lol
24-01-2018T17:03:45,Bgrmystr2,"if you're looking for the spelling if that, then you'd need a g, not a j"
24-01-2018T17:04:13,Bgrmystr2,probably an n or l as well
24-01-2018T17:04:29,Bgrmystr2,"Florangitus, or Floralgitus"
24-01-2018T17:04:43,Bgrmystr2,"either way, the derp has been around for a long time and is not a disease."
24-01-2018T17:04:56,Bgrmystr2,it's just a level of anger.
24-01-2018T17:05:51,RedDeath2018,fine
24-01-2018T17:07:59,RedDeath2018,well ima see if i can do somthhing to livestream off my phone for gaming
24-01-2018T17:08:18,TheFDdriver,good luck
24-01-2018T17:08:42,RedDeath2018,so ima come back and tell you if i got it until then or until i give up bye
24-01-2018T17:09:05,TheFDdriver,see ya
24-01-2018T17:09:16,TheBeckoner,has left to get more coffee
24-01-2018T17:14:57,TheBeckoner,is back with the previously desired and now obtained coffee.
24-01-2018T17:15:10,TheFDdriver,enjoy
24-01-2018T17:15:49,TheBeckoner,I sure will. ^-^
24-01-2018T17:33:09,TheBeckoner,"Hm I really need a new mouse, any suggestions?"
24-01-2018T17:33:21,TheBeckoner,*Computer mouse
24-01-2018T17:33:24,Bgrmystr2,Depends on what you're looking for
24-01-2018T17:33:44,Bgrmystr2,"If you want Ergonomic, I'd recommend the Logitech MX Master"
24-01-2018T17:33:52,TheBeckoner,"A gaming mouse, with a incremental scroll wheel that is sorta heavy."
24-01-2018T17:33:59,TheBeckoner,I'll look it up
24-01-2018T17:34:47,TheFDdriver,see ya everyone
24-01-2018T17:34:50,Bgrmystr2,"It's it has two wheels, one for vertical, one for horizontal, three thumb buttons, left/right click, wheel click, and a switch for the wheel"
24-01-2018T17:34:55,Bgrmystr2,to change it from clicks to free roll
24-01-2018T17:35:41,Bgrmystr2,"it's also darkfield, I believe, so it should even work on glass"
24-01-2018T17:35:58,Bgrmystr2,not 100% sure on that though
24-01-2018T17:36:15,Bgrmystr2,can test
24-01-2018T17:36:38,TheBeckoner,Well it looks big enough and it says it has click to click type scrolling and fast type...
24-01-2018T17:36:50,TheBeckoner,how heavy is it?
24-01-2018T17:36:54,TheBeckoner,wait nvm
24-01-2018T17:37:19,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-01-2018T17:37:27,TheBeckoner,The description says it has darkfield stuffs
24-01-2018T17:37:51,Bgrmystr2,yeah
24-01-2018T17:37:58,Bgrmystr2,"it works on the glass shelves in my fridge, so"
24-01-2018T17:38:01,Bgrmystr2,can confirm xD
24-01-2018T17:38:18,Bgrmystr2,"it'll work on any flat surface, which is good"
24-01-2018T17:38:45,TorqueEmUp,I just have the Logitech Proteus Core
24-01-2018T17:38:48,Bgrmystr2,it's bluetooth as well
24-01-2018T17:39:04,TorqueEmUp,G502
24-01-2018T17:39:07,Bgrmystr2,and the connector it comes with can even connect to a logitech keyboard as well
24-01-2018T17:39:23,Bgrmystr2,so it only takes one USB slot instead of two
24-01-2018T17:39:46,TheBeckoner,Fridge gaming is very important now days.
24-01-2018T17:40:12,Bgrmystr2,"lol Beck, Darkfield means it can work on any surface, even transparent ones"
24-01-2018T17:40:14,Bgrmystr2,like glass shelves
24-01-2018T17:40:26,Bgrmystr2,"those are the only ones I happen to have, so you'll just deal."
24-01-2018T17:40:37,Bgrmystr2,normal laser mice do not work on transparent surfaces
24-01-2018T17:40:45,Bgrmystr2,and have problems on reflective surfaces
24-01-2018T17:41:00,Bgrmystr2,some have dual lasers for triangulation
24-01-2018T17:41:14,TheBeckoner,"Right, thats what I had figured, I was just poking fun. I do have a mouse pad anyway so I should be fine."
24-01-2018T17:41:15,Bgrmystr2,"but honestly, darkfield is a good thing"
24-01-2018T17:41:53,Bgrmystr2,"I just use my desk :thumbsup: Mainly cuz the arm on my chair broke and the less I have to hold my arm up, the better"
24-01-2018T17:42:36,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if I'd use that mouse, Torque. Reminds me of that RAT mouse they came out with"
24-01-2018T17:42:52,Bgrmystr2,"the super adjustable one they made just to cater to ""Hardcore gamers"""
24-01-2018T17:43:10,Bgrmystr2,"thing felt fucking horrid. There's no complete surface, it was all just pieces"
24-01-2018T17:43:15,Bgrmystr2,not a fan
24-01-2018T17:43:30,TheBeckoner,Mmm.
24-01-2018T17:43:42,Bgrmystr2,but the one he posted doesn't look as bad
24-01-2018T17:43:50,Bgrmystr2,though not quite ergonomic
24-01-2018T17:43:51,TheBeckoner,Honestly whatever fits my giant hands and works how I want.
24-01-2018T17:44:26,TheBeckoner,Im liking this logitech one though.
24-01-2018T17:44:36,Bgrmystr2,"Originally, I had the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 2.0"
24-01-2018T17:45:40,Bgrmystr2,Swapped to The MX Master's predecessor
24-01-2018T17:45:50,Bgrmystr2,"can't find the mouse on my desk atm, gemmy a sec"
24-01-2018T17:46:36,TheBeckoner,I just need a new one because apparently 4000 hours into besiege will destroy your middle click button.
24-01-2018T17:46:47,TheBeckoner,Also Im all for a larger mouse
24-01-2018T17:47:00,TheBeckoner,So this is a good excuse to upgrade.
24-01-2018T17:47:23,Bgrmystr2,This was the Microsoft one I used https://www.engadget.com/products/microsoft/wireless-intellimouse/explorer/2-0/
24-01-2018T17:47:37,Bgrmystr2,Then switched to this https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-910-002797-Performance-MX-Mouse/dp/B006P160VG/ref=sr_1_24?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1516920359&sr=1-24&keywords=Logitech+mx+mouse
24-01-2018T17:47:51,Bgrmystr2,"And then when that one broke, my dad bought me the MX master for christmas"
24-01-2018T17:48:01,Bgrmystr2,"and I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me a lot"
24-01-2018T17:48:22,Bgrmystr2,"The Performance MX mouse is also pretty baller, I'd recommend that too"
24-01-2018T17:48:54,Bgrmystr2,"what you can do, Beck, is set one of the thumb buttons on the mouse as the middle click"
24-01-2018T17:48:58,Bgrmystr2,so you don't need to mess with it
24-01-2018T17:49:19,TheBeckoner,Ahhh thats a good idea...
24-01-2018T17:49:25,Bgrmystr2,"middle-click is not always the easiest thing to do, and you have to take one of your fingers off to press it"
24-01-2018T17:49:29,TheBeckoner,I hadn't thought of that...
24-01-2018T17:49:33,Bgrmystr2,so I use the thumb button since there's three of em
24-01-2018T17:49:40,Bgrmystr2,I've done that on all 3 mice
24-01-2018T17:49:56,TheBeckoner,It'll just be a case of me re-learning
24-01-2018T17:49:58,Bgrmystr2,and it's become second nature
24-01-2018T17:50:02,Bgrmystr2,it won't take long lol
24-01-2018T17:50:08,Bgrmystr2,promise xD
24-01-2018T17:50:12,TheBeckoner,Hey man 4000 hours is a while
24-01-2018T17:50:42,Bgrmystr2,"you think I didn't have more than 15 years without a scroll wheel, nevermind a thumb button? :P"
24-01-2018T17:51:03,TheBeckoner,lol
24-01-2018T17:51:25,TheBeckoner,I was born into scroll wheels.
24-01-2018T17:51:34,TheBeckoner,But it wont be any big deal Im sure
24-01-2018T17:52:20,Bgrmystr2,"I promise ya, it won't take long. 4000 hours is significant, no doubt, but give the thumb button a week or two, just enable it to be the middle click, don't even disable the middle click button"
24-01-2018T17:52:34,Bgrmystr2,"so that way if you forget, you still can fall back on what you know"
24-01-2018T17:53:27,TheBeckoner,Right. It's probably more efficient to adapt to a thumb button anyway.
24-01-2018T17:54:26,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, that's the way I see it. The less I need to move my first and second fingers, the better off I am. The wheel I don't use very often, so it's not really a problem"
24-01-2018T17:54:34,Bgrmystr2,not in the thick of a game anyway
24-01-2018T17:55:02,Bgrmystr2,But it's not far enough away that I can't use it either
24-01-2018T17:55:41,Bgrmystr2,"that click for switching the wheel from clicking to freerolling is a god-send, beck xD"
24-01-2018T17:55:48,TheBeckoner,I do need the scroll wheel regardless. I use a set of advanced building tools in Besiege that use the scroll wheel to make incremental increases so I wont be able to ditch it entirely.
24-01-2018T17:56:25,TheBeckoner,"Yeah, my mom had a mouse with a button like that, it was pretty cool."
24-01-2018T17:56:41,Bgrmystr2,"well of course not, but it's not like you're in the middle of a firefight in an FPS or on a perspective view like Diablo or something"
24-01-2018T17:56:44,TheBeckoner,Great for webpages that you need to be to the bottom of.
24-01-2018T17:57:06,TheBeckoner,Oh for sure.
24-01-2018T17:57:25,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not sayin to not use it, just that when you need to be clicking, you don't need to be scrolling, and vice versa, and with the MX master, the wheel isn't far enough away that you can't do both at the same time"
24-01-2018T17:57:37,TheBeckoner,Im glad none of the games Im playing right now actually need the scroll wheel.
24-01-2018T17:58:02,Bgrmystr2,many of mine do
24-01-2018T17:58:08,Bgrmystr2,but it's never been a problem
24-01-2018T17:58:19,TheBeckoner,Well need middle click I should say.
24-01-2018T17:58:36,Bgrmystr2,"Ah yeah, I use that on more games than I do the scroll xD"
24-01-2018T17:58:49,Bgrmystr2,I guess it's just cuz I utilize it
24-01-2018T17:59:25,Bgrmystr2,I miss the Performance MX's ability to lean the scroll wheel left or right..
24-01-2018T17:59:30,Bgrmystr2,that was such a cool feature
24-01-2018T18:00:15,TheBeckoner,"I like ease, I'm not super into customization although Im all for something that works better."
24-01-2018T18:00:48,Bgrmystr2,"Well, if you see it in a shop one day on display, throw your hand on it, see how it feels"
24-01-2018T18:00:53,TheBeckoner,I remember stealing the big red ball out of my parents computer mouse lol that was always fun...
24-01-2018T18:00:53,Bgrmystr2,that's the most important thing
24-01-2018T18:01:04,Bgrmystr2,you're a terrible person xDD
24-01-2018T18:01:15,Bgrmystr2,"that wouldn't work on me though, I have multiple ball mice"
24-01-2018T18:01:24,Bgrmystr2,just replace it :v
24-01-2018T18:01:28,TheBeckoner,"Right. I mean I dont wanna buy something I dislike, Although it would probably work fine."
24-01-2018T18:01:37,Bgrmystr2,well I don't mean buy it
24-01-2018T18:01:59,Bgrmystr2,don't they have displays where they have the mice sitting on the shelf so you can see what it feels like?
24-01-2018T18:02:08,TheBeckoner,Well If I determine that I like it I probably will.
24-01-2018T18:02:19,Bgrmystr2,xD as would anyone :P
24-01-2018T18:02:20,TheBeckoner,"Yeah, I'd have to go to a best buy or something"
24-01-2018T18:02:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's what I was thinking of
24-01-2018T18:02:32,Bgrmystr2,the best buy here has that
24-01-2018T18:02:51,TheBeckoner,"Im sure this one does too, they always have logitech."
24-01-2018T18:03:05,TheBeckoner,Sorry if I respond slow this keyboard is garbage for fast typing.
24-01-2018T18:03:13,TheBeckoner,Logitech G910
24-01-2018T18:03:16,TheBeckoner,Sucks balls
24-01-2018T18:03:24,TheBeckoner,For typing
24-01-2018T18:03:43,Bgrmystr2,:v
24-01-2018T18:04:03,Bgrmystr2,I could type with most keyboards.. even old ones
24-01-2018T18:04:11,Bgrmystr2,not a fan of the non-button ones
24-01-2018T18:04:13,Bgrmystr2,or the flat keys
24-01-2018T18:04:17,Bgrmystr2,those all suck
24-01-2018T18:04:17,TheBeckoner,Its the keycaps that are the issue.
24-01-2018T18:04:32,Bgrmystr2,laptop keyboards suck cuz they're flat and too small
24-01-2018T18:04:44,Bgrmystr2,and the non-button keyboards are worse
24-01-2018T18:04:48,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:C
24-01-2018T18:04:57,TheBeckoner,SOME are raised and others arent so I end up dragging a finger across 3 incorrect letters.
24-01-2018T18:05:05,Bgrmystr2,ew
24-01-2018T18:05:22,TheBeckoner,Yeah Laptop key layouts usualy suck
24-01-2018T18:05:29,Bgrmystr2,"ffffok, brb a few :("
24-01-2018T18:05:42,TheBeckoner,"Hey I gtg, my friend is waiting on me to play Fortnite."
24-01-2018T18:05:46,TheBeckoner,lol perfect timing
24-01-2018T18:05:51,TheBeckoner,See yah
24-01-2018T18:06:25,TheBeckoner,Thanks for the suggestion on the mouse btw.

24-01-2018T18:48:37,Twokinds,Getting good at something really does just mean doing it a lot.
24-01-2018T18:49:11,Twokinds,"There's some inate tallent of of course, but 90% of ""innate talent"" is just... the willingness to do it."

24-01-2018T19:07:43,Bgrmystr2,"they have tablets with screens, Qwe"
24-01-2018T19:07:48,Dadrobit,"Inexpensive is the way to go in general I think for when you're attempting to get into any new hobby, or medium for a hobby."

24-01-2018T19:08:47,Dadrobit,Tablets w/ screens are immediately expensive comparitively afaik.
24-01-2018T19:09:31,qwe304,@Bgrmystr2 those are quite a bit more expensive
24-01-2018T19:09:50,Dadrobit,"Inexpensive touchscreen tablet will probably run you the same as a dedicated drawing tablet with a screen, but the laptop will have more flexibiliyt for general use."

24-01-2018T20:47:07,qwe304,"ya, inking pens would let you refine your drawing more, with finer lines"
24-01-2018T20:48:27,RedDeath2018,But I’m not very good yet to use pens cause I most likely will make a mistake and then it’ll be ruined that’s my only fest
24-01-2018T20:48:33,RedDeath2018,Fear*
24-01-2018T20:50:25,qwe304,"yes, you dont draw with pens, you sketch like you have been then ink over them and then erase"
24-01-2018T20:50:40,qwe304,like how tom does in streams
24-01-2018T20:50:43,RedDeath2018,Oh ok

24-01-2018T20:55:27,RedDeath2018,When I first started I would trace them then my dad told me to free hand so when I did I free handed fairly good so I kept on
24-01-2018T20:56:18,RedDeath2018,Though none of my drawings are perfect I look at my hardest worked on drawing and I feel good about how I did that
24-01-2018T20:57:48,qwe304,"ive been working on individual parts to improve on, eg; right now im working on eyes a lot, just drawing a lot, to get the tecniqe righ"
24-01-2018T20:58:38,RedDeath2018,Yea for me I’ve got the eyes pretty much down for the most part my hardest issue are hands

24-01-2018T23:38:26,funnyman42,No comic update.
24-01-2018T23:38:30,funnyman42,;_;
24-01-2018T23:39:17,Unenlagia,I am sad to hear that.
24-01-2018T23:39:17,Twokinds,"I did update, but the page is invisible."
24-01-2018T23:39:23,Twokinds,You have to use your imagination to see it.
24-01-2018T23:39:55,Unenlagia,What if I am just a cloud of ones and zeroes and has no imagination?
24-01-2018T23:41:17,Twokinds,"Wait, then how are you sad"
24-01-2018T23:41:38,unsteddyphoenix,Only the pure of heart can see it
24-01-2018T23:42:34,Unenlagia,I can effectively simulate emotions
24-01-2018T23:42:37,Unenlagia,Rage is the easiest
24-01-2018T23:44:16,unsteddyphoenix,Emperors new update
24-01-2018T23:45:30,Bgrmystr2,"your simulations are not correct then, Unen."
24-01-2018T23:46:00,Bgrmystr2,You should actually be feeling astonished that there is an update you are not capable of seeing.
24-01-2018T23:46:09,Bgrmystr2,Yet curious as to how you cannot see it.
24-01-2018T23:46:33,Bgrmystr2,Neither of which you seem to be outputting.
24-01-2018T23:46:58,Bgrmystr2,I'd highly suggest sending your emotion simulator back to the tech shop and have it recalibrated for inaccurate readings. :v
24-01-2018T23:50:16,RedDeath2018,Hey guys
24-01-2018T23:50:40,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-greetings:
24-01-2018T23:50:47,Unenlagia,Incorrect. You seem to be under the assumption that the concept of something beyond my understanding or that I am not aware of my own limitations.
24-01-2018T23:51:16,Unenlagia,Parse error: Sentence fragmented.
24-01-2018T23:51:22,Unenlagia,Recalibrating.
24-01-2018T23:51:33,Unenlagia,What was I talking about?

24-01-2018T23:54:34,RedDeath2018,Stupid auto correct
24-01-2018T23:55:25,Bgrmystr2,"See, I knew you'd need to be recalibrated for somethin. :P"
