26-07-2018T12:10:25,TheBeckoner,"I got like 7 hours and felt pretty good, but went back to sleep anyway."
26-07-2018T12:10:34,TheBeckoner,"day off, so why not?"
26-07-2018T12:11:16,Dadrobit,I've been trying to keep in step with a 9 year old and a 13 year old for the last two weeks. I'm burnt out.
26-07-2018T12:11:34,Dadrobit,Reinforcing my will to never have kids of my own lol.
26-07-2018T12:14:08,Twokinds,heheh
26-07-2018T12:14:13,Twokinds,I wish I had that kind of energy again
26-07-2018T12:18:00,Xexanoth,with the current weather it's impossible to have any kind of energy
26-07-2018T12:18:27,Dadrobit,"Only one more major event we have planned besides going to the arcade is tubing down the river, so it should be halfway easy from here."
26-07-2018T12:32:52,TheBeckoner,Tubing is fun. I just got back from white water rafting. Also very fun.
26-07-2018T14:31:38,FennexTheFox,"Hello, chatters"

26-07-2018T16:02:49,Dadrobit,Just had a nasty little accident with a knife and my wrist while I was cleaning up lunch's dishes.
26-07-2018T16:03:18,Dadrobit,"I had the kids over at my house and they about freaked the fuck out worrying I was gonna die, getting all hysterical."
26-07-2018T16:04:05,Xexanoth,"the kids i know would be more like: Cool, Blood"
26-07-2018T16:04:13,NeonMitsumi,"Well, crap."
26-07-2018T16:04:26,Xexanoth,"speaking of blood, Happy BloodMoon everyone"
26-07-2018T16:04:30,Dadrobit,"Knife flipped up after a pot fell on one edge and flew right into my wrist, gonna have a very gnarly scar to explain going forward."
26-07-2018T16:04:56,NeonMitsumi,"Don't die, kthxbye"
26-07-2018T16:05:20,Dadrobit,"Wasn't 911 worried, but that fucker bled for a few minutes."
26-07-2018T16:05:44,NeonMitsumi,You okay now?
26-07-2018T16:05:49,Dadrobit,So the kids are over at the grandparents for the rest of the day to calm down.
26-07-2018T16:06:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I keep a good supply of first aid stuff."
26-07-2018T16:06:21,NeonMitsumi,Good.
26-07-2018T16:06:54,Dadrobit,"Flushed it out, got some steri-strips to close it up, put a big ass band aid on it. Calling it good."
26-07-2018T16:06:58,Xexanoth,"well, as long as most of the blood stayed inside everythings fine"
26-07-2018T16:07:21,Dadrobit,I'll live lol.
26-07-2018T16:07:59,Dadrobit,"There was half a second of, ""oh fuck I just cut an artery didn't I?"" But I got over it pretty quick lol."
26-07-2018T16:08:38,Dadrobit,"But having a 9 year old girl squealing ""Please don't die!"" in my ear was not exactly fun."
26-07-2018T16:09:04,NeonMitsumi,"Hey, at least they care, right?"
26-07-2018T16:09:27,Dadrobit,\o/ Someone cares!

26-07-2018T16:19:34,Xexanoth,not sure how i messed that up
26-07-2018T16:19:35,NeonMitsumi,"""More picks."" More like, all picks."
26-07-2018T16:20:55,Xexanoth,eh we still ned that occasional vote to get the fanservice out of the way ^^

26-07-2018T18:38:10,unsteddyphoenix,Lol im so glad we got closure on Tall Doggo
26-07-2018T18:38:16,unsteddyphoenix,*Phew*
26-07-2018T18:57:17,TheBeckoner,seems im gonna miss the beginning of this stream. hopefully i can catch the end tho.
26-07-2018T18:58:30,MarshallMelon,"It autoarchives, Beckoner. You can always catch up."
26-07-2018T18:58:32,SpazztasticKiwi,This customer. Just asked me. If I was having a baby
26-07-2018T18:58:58,unsteddyphoenix,oh...oh no...
26-07-2018T18:59:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"“No, I’m not pregnant.” “Oh, the way you’re apron looked, it looked like you’re about to have a baby”"
26-07-2018T18:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,*your
26-07-2018T19:00:48,unsteddyphoenix,nice save on their part
26-07-2018T19:04:05,SpazztasticKiwi,No it’s not
26-07-2018T19:04:54,SpazztasticKiwi,The apron is tied tight to my front so it doesn’t snag on anything
26-07-2018T19:05:22,unsteddyphoenix,They couldve panicked and said MUCH worse things.
26-07-2018T19:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"In any case, a man old enough to be my grandpa shouldn’t be commenting on my shape, let alone asking if I’m expecting"
26-07-2018T19:06:26,MarshallMelon,They're always the most likely demographic to ask about that kind of stuff though
26-07-2018T19:06:26,unsteddyphoenix,It's widely regarded as a bad move yes.
26-07-2018T19:08:17,MarshallMelon,On an unrelated note I've discovered it's borderline impossible to contact people outside of the fandom. Getting these files out is damn tricky.
26-07-2018T19:08:41,MarshallMelon,"Outside of Picarto, I mean"
26-07-2018T19:09:04,unsteddyphoenix,what files are you shipping out?
26-07-2018T19:09:28,MarshallMelon,I'm giving the PSD files of my Nora Cards to the original sketch suggesters. It's only fair.
26-07-2018T19:09:35,MarshallMelon,"Or at least, I'm trying to"
26-07-2018T19:09:45,MarshallMelon,Only one I've found so far is Warhawk
26-07-2018T19:09:53,unsteddyphoenix,ah ok
26-07-2018T19:10:14,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah if they're not on a discord somewhere or here...
26-07-2018T19:10:28,unsteddyphoenix,Would prolly be hard to find
26-07-2018T19:10:32,MarshallMelon,I stay away from the Discords. Too much drama.
26-07-2018T19:10:46,unsteddyphoenix,It's handy being in one
26-07-2018T19:10:49,MarshallMelon,Although I've heard Raine's one has calmed down. I might check it out.
26-07-2018T19:11:02,unsteddyphoenix,In case I miss any art or something
26-07-2018T19:11:16,unsteddyphoenix,Just lurk~
26-07-2018T19:11:19,MarshallMelon,There's always the sketch archive and E621 for that
26-07-2018T19:11:35,unsteddyphoenix,Ehh~ this way's less effort
26-07-2018T19:11:40,MarshallMelon,Fair enough
26-07-2018T19:11:49,unsteddyphoenix,Have you messaged them on patreon?
26-07-2018T19:12:00,MarshallMelon,You can't. That's the point.
26-07-2018T19:12:13,unsteddyphoenix,Oh cant you? Why not?
26-07-2018T19:12:14,MarshallMelon,Only way I could is if I became a Creator and they were my Patrons
26-07-2018T19:12:22,unsteddyphoenix,ohhh
26-07-2018T19:12:24,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
26-07-2018T19:12:24,MarshallMelon,Patreon's messaging system's a bit restricted
26-07-2018T19:12:33,unsteddyphoenix,I had no idea.
26-07-2018T19:12:55,MarshallMelon,"Believe me, it the first thing I tried"
26-07-2018T19:12:59,MarshallMelon,*was
26-07-2018T19:13:30,unsteddyphoenix,then I guess the plan is to stalk the stream chat for them
26-07-2018T19:13:37,MarshallMelon,That's why I'm here
26-07-2018T19:13:59,unsteddyphoenix,Nice!
26-07-2018T19:14:04,unsteddyphoenix,Well it's a good deed
26-07-2018T19:14:08,MarshallMelon,Problem is some of them aren't exactly active. I'm pretty sure Ordithus will show up though
26-07-2018T19:14:21,unsteddyphoenix,Ye prob
26-07-2018T19:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,One more hour and I go home

26-07-2018T19:19:51,unsteddyphoenix,I guess you never outgrow being socially awkward
26-07-2018T19:21:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Coworker told him it was really inappropriate of him
26-07-2018T19:34:46,CrRAR,Step 1 of getting a friend to vouch for you:

26-07-2018T19:46:17,MarshallMelon,It's gonna take about 20 minutes. It's a big file.
26-07-2018T19:46:27,MarshallMelon,"Wait, whoops, wrong channel"
26-07-2018T19:46:32,MarshallMelon,NOTHING TO SEE HERE
26-07-2018T19:52:18,NightMeaty22,Step 4: pass out from screaming

26-07-2018T20:28:11,CatzArt,If tom still lives in ohio than he should be on around now since im in the same state.
26-07-2018T20:28:30,Combak,"It's a matter of him getting on, not the time. XD"
26-07-2018T20:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s got other stuff too
26-07-2018T20:29:29,totallynotTrace,"cat, you know you can see who is currently on in the ""userlist""? and tom is logged in at the very least"
26-07-2018T20:30:05,CatzArt,Really? I didnt know that there was that feature cool. I just thought he might be busy with college stuff
26-07-2018T20:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,...He’s in college?
26-07-2018T20:31:05,totallynotTrace,"i dont know for certain that there is a stream, but im assuming there is."
26-07-2018T20:31:28,CatzArt,His bio on two kinds comic said he was pursuing a degree in Radiology if my memory is correct
26-07-2018T20:31:29,Bgrmystr2,Tom's not in college xD
26-07-2018T20:31:37,Bgrmystr2,that was a long time ago bro
26-07-2018T20:31:44,Bgrmystr2,and he never updated it
26-07-2018T20:32:15,CatzArt,or he could have graduated already. Im not sure when the last time that bio was updated
26-07-2018T20:32:31,Vatruvius,I am pretty sure he stopped pursuing that.
26-07-2018T20:32:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Today on “Always Check the Date of Your Info”...
26-07-2018T20:32:51,Vatruvius,I was confused when I first got here by that bio but Tom corrected me.
26-07-2018T20:32:57,totallynotTrace,ikr kiwi
26-07-2018T20:33:09,Bgrmystr2,he's said so many times on the stream chat lol
26-07-2018T20:33:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I was confused cause I was wondering if he’d gone back or something despite saying he had a degree already
26-07-2018T20:33:42,Vatruvius,"Perhaps, though not on the ones I have been on. It was off-stream when I found out."
26-07-2018T20:33:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I just :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:?
26-07-2018T20:35:42,CatzArt,ah I'm not here often so I dont know much about toms life and i dont follow any of his social media either. Well the more you know. I just like to watch these while I practice drawing.

26-07-2018T21:13:45,totallynotTrace,hi char
26-07-2018T21:14:00,BrunoYcaro,hello everyone
26-07-2018T21:14:06,Corinthian,Hey Bruno
26-07-2018T21:14:22,MrEase,hello char!
26-07-2018T21:14:23,totallynotTrace,hi bruno
26-07-2018T21:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Either I’m sleeping in a zig zag pattern tonight or I’m on the floor cause it seems the cats have claimed the bed
26-07-2018T21:14:34,CatzArt,The fun part of this double stream is watching both artists draw. I'm learning alot through this observation.
26-07-2018T21:14:42,Sammit,Hi Bruno
26-07-2018T21:14:46,Bgrmystr2,"move them, kiwi"
26-07-2018T21:14:54,Bgrmystr2,they're cats.
26-07-2018T21:14:54,unsteddyphoenix,no
26-07-2018T21:14:59,Bgrmystr2,yes
26-07-2018T21:15:02,totallynotTrace,my computer doesnt quite like having both streams running
26-07-2018T21:15:15,unsteddyphoenix,zigzag-sleeping is an important skill that every cat owner must have
26-07-2018T21:15:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,agreed
26-07-2018T21:15:29,ZRO4825,It's also fun to watch both because of different styles of artwork.
26-07-2018T21:15:33,totallynotTrace,"bgr, moving cats off a bed is a very bad idea"
26-07-2018T21:15:34,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, but it's not required"
26-07-2018T21:15:45,Bgrmystr2,"please, you'll wath me :P"
26-07-2018T21:15:55,Bgrmystr2,watch me*
26-07-2018T21:15:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi might leave cause she doesn’t like her brother
26-07-2018T21:16:08,totallynotTrace,oh you can do it. you may not wake up in the moring though
26-07-2018T21:16:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least she doesn’t like sharing room with him
26-07-2018T21:16:37,CatzArt,you should try the what the fluff challenge with your cats
26-07-2018T21:16:40,Bgrmystr2,well you need to stop making your cat hate you that it wouldn't respect when you go to sleep :P
26-07-2018T21:16:40,ZRO4825,"It all depends on who's more stubborn, you, or the cat. After enough times of being taken off the bed the cat gets tired of it and goes somewhere else. :P"
26-07-2018T21:16:43,ZoieFalcona,*blinks curiously*
26-07-2018T21:17:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,why not share the bed?
26-07-2018T21:17:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Also Bagheera’s turning 2 tomorrow
26-07-2018T21:17:14,Bgrmystr2,There can only be ONE maar
26-07-2018T21:17:15,ZRO4825,"Dunno Marv, that's usually my solution too, lol"
26-07-2018T21:17:19,Bgrmystr2,marv*
26-07-2018T21:17:19,unsteddyphoenix,awh~
26-07-2018T21:17:22,CatzArt,cats do not know the meaning of the word share
26-07-2018T21:17:41,Bgrmystr2,exactly
26-07-2018T21:18:02,Bgrmystr2,maybe yer just doin it wrong.
26-07-2018T21:18:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It amazes me something so small can take up so much space
26-07-2018T21:18:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My cats do
26-07-2018T21:18:11,ZRO4825,"Mine did. His options were share the bed, or get the hell off it. He learned. :P"
26-07-2018T21:18:25,Gundurr,lol
26-07-2018T21:18:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Not so, a cat will share a bed"
26-07-2018T21:18:43,unsteddyphoenix,"They get your body heat, and they allow you to be in their presence"
26-07-2018T21:18:47,totallynotTrace,"kiwi, that and they are liquid. like how do they take up that much space as a liquid?"
26-07-2018T21:18:50,Vatruvius,"That does not surprise me one bit Kiwi. My dog, if she is on the bed, sprawls all out. Legs in every direction and head fully outstretched. ""This is MY bed now."""
26-07-2018T21:18:50,unsteddyphoenix,It's mutually beneficial
26-07-2018T21:18:55,CatzArt,I know i have a dog who insists on sleeping under the covers in the middle of the bed. Can be uncomfortable
26-07-2018T21:19:02,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ll share the bed with each other only if I’m in the middle
26-07-2018T21:19:26,SageSaga,lol did a bunch of people find out they can turn off my stream and just watch Tom's?
26-07-2018T21:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Otherwise it’s “Moooooom, he’s touching me!”"
26-07-2018T21:19:46,MuonNeutrino,my internet isn't good enough to watch more than one stream at a time =/
26-07-2018T21:19:55,Vatruvius,Oh nooo...Sage!
26-07-2018T21:19:59,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi Happy Birthday to your Cat.

26-07-2018T21:20:26,ZRO4825,I almost always have both open :o
26-07-2018T21:20:44,BadFoMo,I have both open too.
26-07-2018T21:20:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m now watching both
26-07-2018T21:20:53,ZoieFalcona,another cute catgirl
26-07-2018T21:21:01,Vatruvius,I wish I could watch both...I am barely watching either one by itself with minimal stutters.
26-07-2018T21:21:05,SpazztasticKiwi,If Sage’s will load
26-07-2018T21:21:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Look at the Zenny fluff. &lt;3

26-07-2018T21:24:59,SageSaga,she's not really an android at all though
26-07-2018T21:25:04,Twokinds,I'll be 18 tomorrow!

26-07-2018T21:25:29,thestooge,"Huh, answered right before I asked!"
26-07-2018T21:25:34,Vatruvius,Tom would never lie Sage!
26-07-2018T21:25:39,Vatruvius,What are you talking about?

26-07-2018T21:26:14,BadFoMo,19 what?
26-07-2018T21:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,[bullshit detected]

26-07-2018T21:26:22,Vatruvius,lol
26-07-2018T21:26:27,LannAF,:C
26-07-2018T21:26:34,LannAF,don't worry sage
26-07-2018T21:26:37,Vatruvius,Death by soda...what a way to go.
26-07-2018T21:26:40,LannAF,Robotic bodies will come one day
26-07-2018T21:26:59,LannAF,then I can finally have 10 hands to smack people upside the head in a combo
26-07-2018T21:27:03,Vatruvius,You cannot really enjoy a soda then Lann...maybe a fizzy can of oil?
26-07-2018T21:27:04,ferociousfox,good deathimo
26-07-2018T21:27:13,SageSaga,once i have my robot body i can just input the sensation of drinking a soda
26-07-2018T21:27:21,Vatruvius,This is true.
26-07-2018T21:27:28,Vatruvius,You could loop sensations.
26-07-2018T21:27:31,CatzArt,[Heresy Detected] Deus Vult
26-07-2018T21:27:34,Vatruvius,If they are recorded that is.
26-07-2018T21:27:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Complete with those lovely nose burps
26-07-2018T21:27:40,ZRO4825,Robot bodies are a terrible idea. There would be so many Toyokos.
26-07-2018T21:27:42,ZRO4825,Wait....
26-07-2018T21:27:43,LannAF,I'd rather biological augmentations
26-07-2018T21:27:45,ZRO4825,:thinking:
26-07-2018T21:27:59,ZRO4825,I'd like to retract my previous opinion.
26-07-2018T21:28:10,Vatruvius,lol
26-07-2018T21:28:38,SpazztasticKiwi,With robot bodies we run into the “My cpu is bigger than yours” problem
26-07-2018T21:28:41,LannAF,Hey Tom
26-07-2018T21:28:47,BadFoMo,I'm still waiting for BioShock Plasmeds.
26-07-2018T21:28:48,Gundurr,does anyone else drink an ungodly amount of milk a day?
26-07-2018T21:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Like lift kits for trucks but more obnoxious
26-07-2018T21:28:58,LannAF,"Since y'all are playing DnD tomorrow, should I go on ahead and hide the owlbear babies?"
26-07-2018T21:29:04,Vatruvius,"But that would be your brain Kiwi, and it would likely be number of CPU's or cores, not size."
26-07-2018T21:29:12,CatzArt,dont make fun of androids. Kevlars character Ara would have something to say or god forbid Warning.
26-07-2018T21:29:22,ZRO4825,Warning! &lt;3
26-07-2018T21:29:30,LannAF,Robot characters all deserve the name Tincan
26-07-2018T21:29:33,Bespin,I love ARA
26-07-2018T21:29:33,Vatruvius,Make booby-trap owlbears Lann.

26-07-2018T21:29:39,unsteddyphoenix,that is incredibly racist lann
26-07-2018T21:29:42,Vatruvius,Hello Mvilu.
26-07-2018T21:29:54,MviluUatusun,"Howdy, Vat.  How's your Friday going?"
26-07-2018T21:29:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Vat, there’s no limit to the stupidity in that argument. That’s the point"
26-07-2018T21:29:58,LannAF,I called one of my community officers that and she would throw the biggest fit
26-07-2018T21:30:13,ZoieFalcona,Oh??
26-07-2018T21:30:18,Vatruvius,"Pretty good, just watching a stream and working on my webcomic storyline. Taking a while."
26-07-2018T21:30:23,LannAF,She played a race called a Mechari
26-07-2018T21:30:27,LannAF,Robot peeps
26-07-2018T21:30:30,Vatruvius,Does not help when I talk in chat and read comments.

26-07-2018T21:32:01,MviluUatusun,I don't play games.  That's one reason I failed kindergarten.

26-07-2018T21:57:22,ferociousfox,i dont want anyone to suffer
26-07-2018T21:57:36,ferociousfox,but people shouldnt be forced to do anything
26-07-2018T21:57:42,CatzArt,Mvilu as an individual pursuing a degree in natural resource management it is my duty to tell you to NEVER BUILD A HOME IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE!
26-07-2018T21:57:45,MviluUatusun,"Oh, I've had it as long as I can remember.  I'd rather have it than not."
26-07-2018T21:57:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I know someone who lives up there who’s got special wall-grounded shelves just for earthquakes
26-07-2018T21:58:12,MviluUatusun,"Believe me, Catz.  You don't have to worry about me doing that."
26-07-2018T21:58:16,MviluUatusun,I don't even know what it is.
26-07-2018T21:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Earthquakes - when the earth decides to spontaneously do the chimichanga
26-07-2018T21:58:39,CatzArt,There are all sort of things you can do to help fire proof your home in the event of forest fires
26-07-2018T21:58:47,ZoieFalcona,but what to do tonight.
26-07-2018T21:59:00,CatzArt,check with the forest service.
26-07-2018T21:59:01,BadFoMo,Back.
26-07-2018T21:59:18,MviluUatusun,Don't plant grass around your house.  Clear the land for at least 300 yards around your house.
26-07-2018T21:59:28,ZoieFalcona,I already did.. they told me that I can't come back until I bring at least a half dozen felines with me
26-07-2018T21:59:32,MviluUatusun,"Those two ideas work.  Right, Catz?"
26-07-2018T21:59:35,Mihari,"Only you can start forest fires, oh wait... that's wrong. Kinda."
26-07-2018T21:59:43,CatzArt,yep pretty much.
26-07-2018T21:59:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Course said person also has a pottery room so , lots of breakable to shake around"
26-07-2018T21:59:50,ZoieFalcona,"Well... in a sense, Mihari ;)"
26-07-2018T22:00:09,MviluUatusun,"I've always wondered about that one, Mihari.  How do you prevent lightning strikes?  Right?"
26-07-2018T22:00:22,ferociousfox,most forest fires are caused by humans
26-07-2018T22:00:26,Mihari,"Well thing about lighting, it happens during thunderstorms..."
26-07-2018T22:00:29,FoxxTrotter,"Apparently, arson is the case in many of these recent California wildfires."
26-07-2018T22:00:30,Mihari,Thus severe rain
26-07-2018T22:00:35,MviluUatusun,"Oh, I know, ferocious.  I was being facetious."
26-07-2018T22:00:36,Mihari,thus putting it's own fire 90% of hte time
26-07-2018T22:00:40,Bgrmystr2,"well, not always rain"
26-07-2018T22:00:46,Bgrmystr2,but yeah usually rain
26-07-2018T22:01:00,unsteddyphoenix,how handy!
26-07-2018T22:01:02,ZoieFalcona,By making ranger towers higher than the trees... lightning rod :D
26-07-2018T22:01:02,Mihari,"snow, wind, sand, all those things also snuff out fires"
26-07-2018T22:01:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Like those dumbass teen boys that set off that big one “playing” with cocktail bombs?
26-07-2018T22:01:13,CatzArt,Mostly we have been trying to reduce the fire risk by using controlled burns to remove the build up of fuel that has built up over the years through forest mismanagment.
26-07-2018T22:01:42,FoxxTrotter,"Many fire towers are a thing of the past now, Zoie, with better radio communications."
26-07-2018T22:01:54,BadFoMo,Cocktail Bomb?
26-07-2018T22:01:58,FoxxTrotter,"Of course, that also depends on the county. :0P"
26-07-2018T22:02:02,MviluUatusun,I live about 50 miles from the Okefenokee Swamp.  They have severe fires every 5 years or so.
26-07-2018T22:02:25,Bgrmystr2,I think I've been there as a kid once..
26-07-2018T22:02:30,Bgrmystr2,on a school trip
26-07-2018T22:02:34,MviluUatusun,They had one a few years ago that burned about 60% of the swamp.
26-07-2018T22:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Those bottle bomb things
26-07-2018T22:02:47,Bgrmystr2,aww mvilu really? :(
26-07-2018T22:03:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Whatever they are
26-07-2018T22:03:06,CatzArt,yep but fires are important to the health of the forest ecosystem. Spazz molitov cocktails are great for burning things
26-07-2018T22:03:07,MviluUatusun,Yeah.  They wouldn't let you visit the swamp for almost two years.
26-07-2018T22:03:32,CatzArt,Isnt yosemite on fire at the moment?
26-07-2018T22:03:41,Gundurr,is Nat embarrased?
26-07-2018T22:03:42,FoxxTrotter,Pretty close to it.
26-07-2018T22:03:45,MviluUatusun,"That be true, yes, Catz.  The Okefenokee Swamp needs fires to keep the swamp open."
26-07-2018T22:03:46,ferociousfox,i dont think the park itselfis
26-07-2018T22:03:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but these kids decided throwing them around out in the woods during a bit of a drought was a good idea
26-07-2018T22:04:40,ZoieFalcona,-.-
26-07-2018T22:04:43,ferociousfox,the temps here in cali go harder than moonshine
26-07-2018T22:04:55,ferociousfox,at least its not arizona

26-07-2018T22:04:58,SpazztasticKiwi,They were charged
26-07-2018T22:05:13,MviluUatusun,"Well, everyone.  I've enjoyed the streams and comraderie(sp) but, it's time for this old man to find his way to bed.  I'll see y'all later."
26-07-2018T22:05:21,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Mvilu."
26-07-2018T22:05:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Mvilu

26-07-2018T22:07:39,ZoieFalcona,"My comment was more of a smarty-assy one regarding preventing lightning strikes from causing fires... not as in spotting wildfires, which is their primary purpose so they can communicate with proper authorities as well as  spot their movement as things at"
26-07-2018T22:07:40,BadFoMo,*scarf?

26-07-2018T22:12:17,CatzArt,I dont know how people Like tom and Temiree do it. I just use mine to color lineart that i scan out of my sketch book
26-07-2018T22:12:19,Nekonny,OBS is not connecting
26-07-2018T22:12:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,;-;

26-07-2018T22:13:41,CatzArt,yeah I have an intuos draw as well after Temiree on deviantart recomended it
26-07-2018T22:13:47,SageSaga,but if you need a display tablet i hear the Huion drawing tablets are great
26-07-2018T22:13:56,Nekonny,did something change on picarto from earlier today?
26-07-2018T22:14:11,SageSaga,and they are like 1/3rd the price of the cheapest cintiq
26-07-2018T22:14:27,Bgrmystr2,I saw that lil bounce
26-07-2018T22:15:05,CatzArt,yeah but im stingy and most of what i do is traditional. Plus my art skills havent grown enough to where I feel ready to commit to buying more expensive art supplies
26-07-2018T22:15:07,Nekonny,"honna restart, brb"
26-07-2018T22:15:16,Twokinds,I have to try very hard to remember not to bounce

26-07-2018T22:15:38,unsteddyphoenix,Saving it up for something~?
26-07-2018T22:15:57,ZRO4825,"Got an intuos myself. Contemplated stepping up to small huion with a screen built-in, but not sure if it would help enough to make me wanna try to art more often."
26-07-2018T22:16:02,Twokinds,Cause I don't wanna spam Sage's chat while I'm multiing
