17-01-2018T00:02:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"No more like I'm 2 out of 4 artist down, just sage and Tom left"
17-01-2018T00:03:00,Crehvan,"You asked for Zenbutt, not quality Zenbutt"
17-01-2018T00:03:21,Vexd,And that's what I've been saying for almost 6 months now; make it a suggestion!

17-01-2018T00:05:22,Vexd,Hang on
17-01-2018T00:05:33,MuonNeutrino,having a character named zen has opportunities that way ^^
17-01-2018T00:05:55,unsteddyphoenix,A good writer makes all his charas names punnable

17-01-2018T00:06:31,KuroganeWatanoshi,huh. 74 songs..
17-01-2018T00:06:36,TheBeckoner,Then He wouldn't be Zen
17-01-2018T00:06:37,unsteddyphoenix,He needs to stop being such a rowdyboi then
17-01-2018T00:06:41,KuroganeWatanoshi,It feels like there's more in the stream xD

17-01-2018T00:06:59,Bgrmystr2,"there is, Kuro"
17-01-2018T00:07:07,MuonNeutrino,"@KuroganeWatanoshi probably, i think that's just a playlist someone put together based on what they've seen in the stream, not tom's actual playlist"
17-01-2018T00:07:11,Bgrmystr2,"Like I said, there is no full playlist"
17-01-2018T00:07:17,KuroganeWatanoshi,oooh

17-01-2018T00:10:23,BadFoMo,"//Troll Wait! I know how they can heal Zen! They need to open a portal to Xen (from Half-Life), then take Zen to Xen and get him into one of thoes healing pools."

17-01-2018T19:14:16,Bgrmystr2,it's nice. you should try it. :)
17-01-2018T19:14:52,RandomTKLover,"Just homework, family, streams, and shop for me"
17-01-2018T19:17:59,RandomTKLover,"Anyways, I was thinking of starting each chapter of my comic with a poem that kind of sums up the chapter"
17-01-2018T19:18:09,RandomTKLover,What do you think?
17-01-2018T19:19:31,Bgrmystr2,Dunno. :u
17-01-2018T19:19:40,TheFDdriver,hello
17-01-2018T19:20:03,RandomTKLover,Hi
17-01-2018T19:20:54,TheFDdriver,"now that i read the comment, wouldn't be better after you make the comic"
17-01-2018T19:21:47,RandomTKLover,"True, but im not a vert creative person, I need lots of time to work"
17-01-2018T19:22:20,TheFDdriver,you know you can take your time
17-01-2018T19:22:28,RandomTKLover,"Also, my comic is fairly depressing, lots of lost love and war, and things like that"
17-01-2018T19:23:18,TheFDdriver,ohh
17-01-2018T19:23:28,RandomTKLover,I thought a poem would really bring it together
17-01-2018T19:23:44,TheFDdriver,yes i think so too
17-01-2018T19:23:54,TheFDdriver,but not in the beginning
17-01-2018T19:24:25,RandomTKLover,I thought it would be good for the prologue
17-01-2018T19:24:37,TheFDdriver,then yes
17-01-2018T19:25:18,qwe304,am i the only one that uses the stream recordings for background music?
17-01-2018T19:25:33,TheFDdriver,"that would add the ""magic touch"""
17-01-2018T19:25:54,TheFDdriver,and no qwe
17-01-2018T19:26:05,RandomTKLover,"Hi qwe, and no"
17-01-2018T19:26:45,Bgrmystr2,prolly not qwe. I have a few songs from the stream I put into my music list for when I'm doing other things.
17-01-2018T19:27:16,RandomTKLover,Like 60% of my favs are from the stream
17-01-2018T19:33:02,TheFDdriver,they are good music
17-01-2018T19:34:18,RandomTKLover,You know what? Ima listen to some now
17-01-2018T19:34:27,RandomTKLover,Bye for now

17-01-2018T19:40:33,Dadrobit,\o/ Week one of classes is complete. Only 15 left.

17-01-2018T19:42:35,Dadrobit,"I love my classes, so I'm looking forward to the next few months honestly."
17-01-2018T19:43:03,TheBeckoner,I think all of mine are gonna be good except for history.
17-01-2018T19:44:09,Dadrobit,"Still working out what I'm going to work on for my Sound Design capstone project,but I think it's going to be one of the Witcher 3 trailers."
17-01-2018T19:44:20,Dadrobit,"project, bu*"
17-01-2018T19:44:23,Dadrobit,but**
17-01-2018T19:45:00,TheBeckoner,Sounds good. The witcher 3 is visually appealing.
17-01-2018T19:46:04,Dadrobit,"My partner and I are a little worried though, the trailer we really want to do includes a bit of a nip-slip, and we don't want to work on making a demo-reel worthy project that will be too off-putting to potential clients...."
17-01-2018T19:46:49,Dadrobit,So we're still on the lookout and we'll be consulting the professors next week on where to go from here.
17-01-2018T19:49:32,TheFDdriver,hope you get good luck
17-01-2018T19:50:04,Dadrobit,Forget luck. I'm all about skill and ability.
17-01-2018T19:50:09,Dadrobit,But thank you  :D
17-01-2018T19:52:19,TheFDdriver,no problem
17-01-2018T19:55:54,TheBeckoner,"""No nips, no business"""

17-01-2018T19:57:17,TheBeckoner,Oh?
17-01-2018T19:57:35,Dadrobit,"With this drink in hand, I am officially out of Maker's 46!"
17-01-2018T19:58:15,Dadrobit,The final glass is at hand.
17-01-2018T19:58:31,Dadrobit,And an era is at an end....
17-01-2018T20:00:30,TheBeckoner,"I can't drink, but do they not make that anymore?"
17-01-2018T20:00:50,Dadrobit,Maker's 46?!!?!?
17-01-2018T20:01:01,Dadrobit,They better not have!
17-01-2018T20:04:27,TheBeckoner,Lol then buy more?
17-01-2018T20:04:52,TheFDdriver,was about to say the same thing
17-01-2018T20:05:08,Dadrobit,"Naw, they're definitely still making this. This shit's delicious!"
17-01-2018T20:06:37,TheFDdriver,"you mean by ""era"" = last drink"
17-01-2018T20:09:04,Dadrobit,As of only a few days ago their Twitter is still advertising it after a fashion. https://twitter.com/MakersMark/status/953254075793117185
17-01-2018T20:09:32,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, you thought my wording meant that they were done?"
17-01-2018T20:09:40,TheBeckoner,Haha yeah
17-01-2018T20:09:43,TheFDdriver,yes
17-01-2018T20:09:53,Dadrobit,"Naw, just that I've been working on that bottle for well over a year."
17-01-2018T20:10:17,TheBeckoner,Oh I see. Well it's time to start a new bottle?
17-01-2018T20:10:39,TheFDdriver,"Lol ""Twitter took to long"" it was only 1 second"
17-01-2018T20:11:14,Dadrobit,"I still have an almost full bottle of Maker's Mark left, which is pretty similar. https://twitter.com/MakersMark/status/948378815335714817"
17-01-2018T20:11:46,Dadrobit,Their bottles are so goddamned sexy.
17-01-2018T20:12:03,Dadrobit,"But yeah, need to get a new bottle of 46."

17-01-2018T20:13:10,TheFDdriver,cool isn't it!!?
17-01-2018T20:13:11,Dadrobit,"Yup, every bottle is hand labeled and finished."
17-01-2018T20:13:41,TheFDdriver,every bottle with a different pattern
17-01-2018T20:13:44,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, just looks like a bottle to me lol"
17-01-2018T20:13:51,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
17-01-2018T20:14:00,TheFDdriver,hey Bgr
17-01-2018T20:14:02,Dadrobit,"If you go tour the facility, they let you dunk one for yourself."

17-01-2018T20:15:22,TheBeckoner,I wanna dump a bottle in wax...
17-01-2018T20:15:55,TheFDdriver,it would be a good experience
17-01-2018T20:16:43,Dadrobit,"The Maker's Mark is kind of standard, but the 46 is curvaceous as all get out. THICC one might even say!"
17-01-2018T20:17:15,TheFDdriver,need to see
17-01-2018T20:17:45,Dadrobit,https://www.makersmark.com/makers-46
17-01-2018T20:19:19,TheFDdriver,beautiful
17-01-2018T20:19:25,Dadrobit,"Also, yeah, it's a goal to one day travel to Kentucky and tour the facility."
17-01-2018T20:20:27,TheFDdriver,"that would be cool, see how its made"
17-01-2018T20:21:07,TheBeckoner,Dad said thicc.
17-01-2018T20:21:12,TheBeckoner,It must be good.
17-01-2018T20:21:46,TheFDdriver,didnt dadro said he get exited if you call him like that?
17-01-2018T20:22:18,TheBeckoner,what?
17-01-2018T20:22:35,TheBeckoner,Dadrobit = Dad = Robit etc...
17-01-2018T20:22:45,TheFDdriver,nvm
17-01-2018T20:22:59,TheFDdriver,it was with the -y
17-01-2018T20:23:01,Dadrobit,"Lol, it works."
17-01-2018T20:23:30,Dadrobit,"But yeah, I'm usually not a fan of hard liquor, but this stuff is #Quality."
17-01-2018T20:24:03,TheFDdriver,for you to say it.. I take your words
17-01-2018T20:24:36,Dadrobit,It's a nice way to warm up on these cold (72°) nights.
17-01-2018T20:25:04,TheFDdriver,F°?
17-01-2018T20:25:06,TheBeckoner,warm cold way to warm up I guess
17-01-2018T20:25:20,Dadrobit,I'd probably be dead if it was C no?
17-01-2018T20:25:27,TheFDdriver,no
17-01-2018T20:25:28,TheBeckoner,I'll have to try some someday I suppose.
17-01-2018T20:25:38,TheFDdriver,but about to
17-01-2018T20:25:56,TheBeckoner,You'd be very hot and about to die- soon
17-01-2018T20:26:10,Dadrobit,161F° would be 72C°
17-01-2018T20:26:16,TheFDdriver,yes?
17-01-2018T20:26:16,TheBeckoner,yup
17-01-2018T20:26:19,TheBeckoner,cookin
17-01-2018T20:26:36,TheFDdriver,I can say you cant go outside
17-01-2018T20:26:47,TheBeckoner,I think 120F is maximum safe operating temp for a human with extra water.
17-01-2018T20:26:58,TheFDdriver,you will need to be underground
17-01-2018T20:26:59,TheBeckoner,like extra drinkable water

17-01-2018T20:27:22,TheFDdriver,damm
17-01-2018T20:27:23,Dadrobit,the*
17-01-2018T20:27:34,TheBeckoner,I have seen 120 here on occasion and it sucks.
17-01-2018T20:27:42,TheFDdriver,mine was 110°
17-01-2018T20:27:52,TheFDdriver,on P.R
17-01-2018T20:27:59,Dadrobit,Mid to upper teens is pretty regular fare here.
17-01-2018T20:28:07,Dadrobit,"It sucks, but whatever."
17-01-2018T20:28:22,Dadrobit,"""Oh no! I have to stay inside and play video games I guess!"""
17-01-2018T20:28:37,TheFDdriver,Xd
17-01-2018T20:28:58,TheBeckoner,People say death valley gets to 130F and with extra drinking water you'll be fine. Im not sure how true that is though since it came from quora
17-01-2018T20:29:23,TheFDdriver,maybe?

17-01-2018T20:29:47,Dadrobit,Don't go barefoot on the street.
17-01-2018T20:29:51,TheBeckoner,"But it seems reasonable since attics easily get that hot and I;ve worked in those before, they extra suck."
17-01-2018T20:30:29,TheBeckoner,mmm pork
17-01-2018T20:31:05,TheFDdriver,well at least no need for stove
17-01-2018T20:31:32,TheFDdriver,$ saving
17-01-2018T20:31:58,Dadrobit,It is kind of a problem though. Lots of heat related deaths out here. Especially for homeless and the elderly.
17-01-2018T20:32:51,TheFDdriver,RIP people unprepared
17-01-2018T20:33:18,Dadrobit,"Like folks with alzheimer's who drive off and get lost, then stranded on the side of the road when they run themselves out of gas looking to get back home."
17-01-2018T20:33:53,TheFDdriver,that's harsh
17-01-2018T20:33:56,Dadrobit,It's really fucking tragic actually.
17-01-2018T20:34:25,TheBeckoner,Aww...man thats real sad
17-01-2018T20:35:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you see a Silver Alert on the street signs in summer, and it's a bad time. Really pay attention to those."
