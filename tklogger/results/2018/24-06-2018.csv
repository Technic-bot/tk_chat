24-06-2018T00:00:23,MallardDuckAvia,Can I buy her potions on Amazon?
24-06-2018T00:00:28,CrRAR,"woo, enterprising woman FTW"
24-06-2018T00:01:09,unsteddyphoenix,I think youre right iliar
24-06-2018T00:03:12,MallardDuckAvia,Hey Tom. Do you draw art in your spare time that you don‚Äôt post online?
24-06-2018T00:03:26,Twokinds,I don't have time.
24-06-2018T00:03:36,Twokinds,I'm trying to do another project
24-06-2018T00:03:41,MallardDuckAvia,Oh ok
24-06-2018T00:03:49,Twokinds,But it's hard to get any free moments.
24-06-2018T00:03:56,MallardDuckAvia,Ok. I understand
24-06-2018T00:04:49,unsteddyphoenix,...which project are you referring lol
24-06-2018T00:04:57,unsteddyphoenix,Potts adventures?
24-06-2018T00:04:59,Twokinds,Exactly
24-06-2018T00:05:04,Twokinds,Which
24-06-2018T00:05:11,MallardDuckAvia,How did you get so good at drawing? I practice a lot but human proportions really throw me off. I can draw anything except for humans and any other mammal
24-06-2018T00:05:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, thought so xD"
24-06-2018T00:05:33,Twokinds,15 years of practice will make anyone good
24-06-2018T00:05:42,Twokinds,Or at least halfway decent
24-06-2018T00:05:49,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôm 15 and have practiced all my life
24-06-2018T00:06:20,CrRAR,Bold statement xD
24-06-2018T00:06:20,MallardDuckAvia,I can‚Äôt draw people unless I have 3 weeks to spend erasing and redrawing lines
24-06-2018T00:06:23,Ordithus,"""Master teach me your ways"""
24-06-2018T00:07:18,unsteddyphoenix,Came out the womb drawing
24-06-2018T00:07:24,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHalfway decent‚Äù sounds about right
24-06-2018T00:08:21,MallardDuckAvia,Fine. I‚Äôve been drawing ever since I can remember. Probably around 3 years old
24-06-2018T00:09:21,CrRAR,There is no magic method. Practice and refine and practice.
24-06-2018T00:09:34,MallardDuckAvia,I can draw an Airplane in an hour and have it look better than anyone I know but my people just look like they have a birth defect of some sort
24-06-2018T00:09:47,Ordithus,People are notoriously hard to draw
24-06-2018T00:09:55,CrRAR,^
24-06-2018T00:10:04,Ordithus,Have you tried furries? http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurriesAreEasierToDraw
24-06-2018T00:10:19,MallardDuckAvia,I have. Just as hard
24-06-2018T00:10:50,MallardDuckAvia,"Really any Manmal is difficult for me. I‚Äôm good with fish, Dinosaurs, birds, and reptiles"
24-06-2018T00:11:12,unsteddyphoenix,Huh...interesting...so furries are easier?
24-06-2018T00:11:21,unsteddyphoenix,"I guess that makes sense, reading this"
24-06-2018T00:11:24,MallardDuckAvia,No. Harder for me
24-06-2018T00:11:33,BadFoMo,That's why I moved on to writing.
24-06-2018T00:11:43,CrRAR,If that URL has anything to say about it unsteddy xD
24-06-2018T00:11:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, I did read it lol"
24-06-2018T00:11:59,unsteddyphoenix,Made some decent points
24-06-2018T00:12:06,Twokinds,I wish I could write better
24-06-2018T00:12:32,Twokinds,I can draw for hours but I write with great difficulty.
24-06-2018T00:12:58,Twokinds,I just can't stand to sit down and write out a script.
24-06-2018T00:13:10,MallardDuckAvia,Type it then
24-06-2018T00:13:17,Bgrmystr2,"it makes a lot of sense honestly, cuz it's a real thing, the uncanny valley"
24-06-2018T00:13:17,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
24-06-2018T00:13:18,unsteddyphoenix,.
24-06-2018T00:13:25,unsteddyphoenix,yeah it really is bgr
24-06-2018T00:13:43,unsteddyphoenix,I have been finding it easier to practise drawing than writing recently
24-06-2018T00:13:53,iliar,I wonder how you motivated yourself to continue drawing at the beginning of the journey?
24-06-2018T00:13:56,iliar,"I mean, when you just started drawing. You drew something, looked at the result and realized that it was terrible. What motivated you to draw the next picture."
24-06-2018T00:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it an imagination problem or a don‚Äôt know how to word it problem
24-06-2018T00:14:07,Bgrmystr2,tis why humans always kinda look funny.. but animals are still animals even if they're misshappen a bit
24-06-2018T00:14:16,Bgrmystr2,humans are clearly.. like.. wtf is that thing
24-06-2018T00:14:31,Bgrmystr2,if it's not on-the-spot
24-06-2018T00:14:44,MallardDuckAvia,Would it be harder for animals to draw animals then?
24-06-2018T00:14:44,Twokinds,"It wasn't easy, starting out. But I just loved to draw."
24-06-2018T00:14:55,Twokinds,"Did it all the time, even when I was bad."
24-06-2018T00:15:36,MallardDuckAvia,I love to draw too but most my art I have to destroy or hide to keep it away from my parents and I only draw at night
24-06-2018T00:15:49,Bgrmystr2,dunno mallard. Don't know many animals capable of artistic capability to draw well enough to differenciate quality human and anthro illustrations
24-06-2018T00:16:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I do line stuff. And fancy words
24-06-2018T00:16:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Realism is cool but not a big interest
24-06-2018T00:17:05,MallardDuckAvia,I mainly focus on airplanes in my art. I‚Äôm even somewhat famous for it
24-06-2018T00:19:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Wanna hear a joke
24-06-2018T00:19:50,SpazztasticKiwi,A plane‚Äôs propeller is actually a big fan to keep the pilot cool
24-06-2018T00:20:04,Ordithus,Deep :ptv-snicker:
24-06-2018T00:20:18,SpazztasticKiwi,When it stops you can see the pilot start sweating
24-06-2018T00:20:30,Ordithus,I knew that was coming
24-06-2018T00:20:34,Ordithus,lol
24-06-2018T00:20:40,MallardDuckAvia,That‚Äôs funny
24-06-2018T00:20:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I have more
24-06-2018T00:20:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Many more
24-06-2018T00:21:02,MallardDuckAvia,Technically the engine provides the plane with AC
24-06-2018T00:21:20,MallardDuckAvia,On Jets and Turboprops at least
24-06-2018T00:24:42,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôm going to head to bed soon
24-06-2018T00:24:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok

24-06-2018T00:25:05,MallardDuckAvia,Good night

24-06-2018T00:25:22,Ordithus,Night Mallard
24-06-2018T00:25:23,MallardDuckAvia,Ok
24-06-2018T00:25:39,MallardDuckAvia,Let me hear it spazz
24-06-2018T00:26:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"I prefer guys that make small dick jokes about themselves than big dick jokes, but my boyfriend has a medium dick"
24-06-2018T00:26:44,SpazztasticKiwi,It can talk to ghosts
24-06-2018T00:27:00,MallardDuckAvia,That‚Äôs pretty good

24-06-2018T00:27:39,iliar,Hm... 'I just loved to draw' This thing that I can not understand. I was trying to learn how to draw. I did not set high goals. I tried to draw boxes for many hours. Just square boxes from different angles. And I felt pain when I looked at the result.
24-06-2018T00:27:39,BadFoMo,No such thing.
24-06-2018T00:27:41,FenceEqualizer,Alright that was a good one

24-06-2018T01:10:29,Vatruvius,"Yes, how did you know! XD"
24-06-2018T01:11:32,Twokinds,XD
24-06-2018T01:11:55,Twokinds,So what did you really come up with
24-06-2018T01:11:59,Vatruvius,"Since my race was created rather than evolve, I wanted a scientific name. I csme up with Homo nasci, ""born from man."""
24-06-2018T01:12:46,Vatruvius,"I will come up with a nickname, like how we are human though scientifically Homo sapien."
24-06-2018T01:13:30,Vatruvius,I sm just glad I have an anchor of sorts to tie ideas to.
24-06-2018T01:13:47,Twokinds,Yeah cool
24-06-2018T01:14:32,Vatruvius,Now onto naming the planet...:ptv-confused:

24-06-2018T01:32:33,Bgrmystr2,Bob the moon?

24-06-2018T01:34:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno. Bob‚Äôs got a nice round moon

24-06-2018T01:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Also means some random bob guy is in your bed
24-06-2018T01:37:51,Vatruvius,Well I better go to bed. Got work tommarow. I feel good about getting the scientific name for my race and the name of my planet done. Feels good. Goodnight everyone! :ptv-greetings:

24-06-2018T02:32:07,Dadrobit,I am in distress. Sadrobit full force.
24-06-2018T02:32:31,Dadrobit,Went to look at how last weeks grades were graded. And I got 0's on fucking everything.
24-06-2018T02:33:12,Dadrobit,"Something happened with my uploads getting corrupted or some BS, and the professor couldn't grade them."
24-06-2018T02:34:02,Dadrobit,"I am now in such a state that even if I ace every single assignment from here on out, I can not get an A."
24-06-2018T02:34:10,Dadrobit,And I am livid about that.
24-06-2018T02:34:30,Dadrobit,Going from 98% to impossible A is not okay....
24-06-2018T02:34:57,Bgrmystr2,that's not okay
24-06-2018T02:35:06,Bgrmystr2,did you back them up?
24-06-2018T02:35:14,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
24-06-2018T02:35:55,Dadrobit,"I have them all saved of course, and I've messaged the professor, but she still hasn't even given me the points back on the assignments where she screwed up in not being able to read my pdfs in full."
24-06-2018T02:36:30,Bgrmystr2,"as long as you have your shit, then you can take it above the teacher if they won't fix their fuckup"
24-06-2018T02:36:53,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, this is a class you're paying for, yes?"
24-06-2018T02:36:59,Bgrmystr2,who the fuck are they to fuck with your grades.
24-06-2018T02:38:59,Dadrobit,"Also, I lost my energy drink somewhere in my house, and I'm not happy about that either..."

24-06-2018T22:17:50,Vatruvius,lol...no
24-06-2018T22:18:22,Vatruvius,I am trying to come up with something clever yet similar to human/humans.
24-06-2018T22:18:47,Vatruvius,"Not close, but in the same vein as that."
24-06-2018T22:19:11,Vatruvius,It has proved to be far more difficult than I thought.
24-06-2018T22:21:54,CrRAR,Floofsapiens
24-06-2018T22:24:07,Vatruvius,"Well...I already have a scientific name, Homo nasci. But I am trying to think of a nickname similar to how human is to Homo sapien."
24-06-2018T22:27:38,CrRAR,Hmm
24-06-2018T22:30:03,Vatruvius,Yeah... :thinking:

24-06-2018T22:37:22,MallardDuckAvia,I don‚Äôt think you should use the Homo in the scientific name because if it‚Äôs a species of furry it‚Äôs probably not very close to humans evolution wise. I would just make a new branch of animals
24-06-2018T22:37:35,Vatruvius,Maybe...though it does not ring to me like when I came up with the scientific name. Thanks though.
24-06-2018T22:38:22,CrRAR,The Credooli
24-06-2018T22:39:03,Vatruvius,"In my comic my furry soecies was created in a lab with human DNA as the base genome. Thus, Homo. Nasci means ""be born, breath"" so...Home nasci is ""born from man."""

24-06-2018T22:40:08,Vatruvius,"Credooli, where does that come from?"
24-06-2018T22:40:15,CrRAR,Yeah basically pick two latin words that embodied the species. xD
24-06-2018T22:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I used how ‚Äúhuman‚Äù sounds compared to ‚ÄúHomo sapien‚Äù and then added the same ring ‚Äúhuman‚Äù does. Then you just add a characteristic of ‚Äúnasci‚Äù
24-06-2018T22:40:54,CrRAR,"Idk, that's about the most original thing coming from me at this hour. lol"
24-06-2018T22:41:12,Vatruvius,"I am currently looking at the ""kin"" side and trying to see if I can make something out of it. Cause, ya know...my furry species is akin to humans. XP"
24-06-2018T22:41:37,CrRAR,ahhh
24-06-2018T22:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Then make up a pronunciation unless you want to base that on the words creation
24-06-2018T22:42:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Kin as in ape names?
24-06-2018T22:42:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Or kin to homo sapien
24-06-2018T22:42:58,CrRAR,The Kinsunts
24-06-2018T22:43:21,Vatruvius,"Yeah, trying to. I don't teally want it to come from no where. Human is actual to latin words put together...hue and manis...color of and man, so huemanis is the color of man...which became humanis...then human."
24-06-2018T22:43:43,Vatruvius,two*
24-06-2018T22:44:12,CrRAR,What do these characters look like?
24-06-2018T22:45:24,Vatruvius,"Basically anthro characters. Similar to Tom's but slight differenced. How difficult I have not quite locked in yet, but slightly."
24-06-2018T22:45:37,Vatruvius,different*
24-06-2018T22:45:54,Vatruvius,God I hate this phone's auto-correct.
24-06-2018T22:46:29,Vatruvius,Words I want it to correct it doesn't and words I don't want it to correct it does...*sigh*
24-06-2018T22:47:39,CrRAR,"The Mawkins. ""Similar to human with big mouth"" xD"
24-06-2018T22:48:05,CrRAR,It's a glorious day for Maukin-kind!
24-06-2018T22:48:47,CrRAR,*Mawkin-kind!
24-06-2018T22:49:12,CrRAR,"Actually, Maukins ain't bad either."
24-06-2018T22:49:15,Vatruvius,"lol, though Mawkin kind does sound a bit off..."
24-06-2018T22:49:38,Vatruvius,Thanks though...

24-06-2018T22:51:16,CrRAR,Mauk you! XD
24-06-2018T22:51:37,CrRAR,I think this has potential~
24-06-2018T22:51:40,Vatruvius,lol
24-06-2018T22:53:12,Vatruvius,The plural of Homo sapien is Homo sapiens...however I am thinking with Homo nasci it is just pronounced differently. Instead of of tge ending ce sound it is more of a ci sound.
24-06-2018T22:53:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm drinking some of my green tea and can‚Äôt help but think of how Tom reacted to me saying I don‚Äôt add honey
24-06-2018T22:53:37,Vatruvius,Kind like cacti.
24-06-2018T22:53:47,Vatruvius,lol
24-06-2018T22:53:49,CrRAR,How bout Laufkin(s)?
24-06-2018T22:54:06,CrRAR,Sounds cuddly~
24-06-2018T22:54:15,Vatruvius,"I can relate, tea is quite bitter if you are use to sweet foods or drinks like soda."

24-06-2018T22:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And coffee
24-06-2018T22:55:11,Vatruvius,The suffix -kin is actually diminitive.
24-06-2018T22:55:24,CrRAR,Damnnit!
24-06-2018T22:55:26,Vatruvius,diminutive*
24-06-2018T22:55:37,Toxic8Bit,He doesn't add honey?
24-06-2018T22:56:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Actually I think he was hinting that he adds at least sugar
24-06-2018T22:56:24,CrRAR,"Well, did the humans give them their name? Could provide plot-driving TENSION."
24-06-2018T22:56:32,Vatruvius,"I don't drink tea, in fact I don't drink much of anything other than a brewed root bear as a treat."
24-06-2018T22:56:40,CrRAR,Ooo
24-06-2018T22:56:54,Toxic8Bit,Oh:)
24-06-2018T22:57:26,CrRAR,"Don't call me Maukin, Hoooman. D:&lt;"
24-06-2018T22:57:46,CrRAR,I keeeeel you.
24-06-2018T22:58:28,Vatruvius,"The humans did give the name, and as it stands this species is seen as subhuman to most humans. However, they got their name from the scientists that created them which saw this human made species as a wonder and testiment to human intelligence and"
24-06-2018T22:58:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt do root beer
24-06-2018T22:58:44,Vatruvius,technological advancement.

24-06-2018T22:59:13,CrRAR,How bout... Creeeeam soda Spazz?
24-06-2018T22:59:18,Vatruvius,"The scientists saw this species as an equal intelligent race, but many centuries has passed."

24-06-2018T23:00:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I drink coke
24-06-2018T23:01:04,CrRAR,"Ahh, the old standby."
24-06-2018T23:01:05,Vatruvius,"Too sweet. Basically, most (all ) regular/main brand sodas are too sweet and not flavorful enough for me. Tis why I enjoy brewed root bear."
24-06-2018T23:01:25,CrRAR,Glass bottle cokes are the best.
24-06-2018T23:01:33,Toxic8Bit,^
24-06-2018T23:01:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Coke and tea
24-06-2018T23:01:50,Vatruvius,Glass bottle any soda is typically a better version.
24-06-2018T23:01:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt get coffee often
24-06-2018T23:02:26,Vatruvius,Hmm...bottle coffee. :thinking:
24-06-2018T23:02:28,CrRAR,What's your take on coffee ice cream?
24-06-2018T23:03:05,Vatruvius,"I like it, kerps me up too late though. An after launch ice cream basically."

24-06-2018T23:10:02,SpazztasticKiwi,He seemed pretty interested in the tarot thing yesterday
24-06-2018T23:10:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Most people I‚Äôve met seem to treat it like the cards are going to eat their face
24-06-2018T23:11:05,CrRAR,Yeah it is a mysterious art~
24-06-2018T23:11:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs ink on paper
24-06-2018T23:11:33,CrRAR,Much mystique~
24-06-2018T23:11:52,CrRAR,Very archaic
24-06-2018T23:12:11,CrRAR,Whoops lol
24-06-2018T23:12:25,MallardDuckAvia,I don‚Äôt really care for diets. I‚Äôm at the stage in my life where my metabomakes it so I can eat 3 whole pizzas and be hungry an hour later
24-06-2018T23:12:27,Vatruvius,What?
24-06-2018T23:12:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôll wear off

24-06-2018T23:13:08,Vatruvius,What is tarot?
24-06-2018T23:13:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at the very least it‚Äôll slow down. Don‚Äôt take advantage of it
24-06-2018T23:13:40,MallardDuckAvia,I find it more annoying then anything. I‚Äôm constantly needing to eat or I start to feel sick and tired.
24-06-2018T23:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Tarot is tarot cards - like fortune teller cards
24-06-2018T23:14:13,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôm always needing to eat more

24-06-2018T23:42:40,Vatruvius,I have another problem with my comic besides the name thing which I am sure will resolve itself eventually.
24-06-2018T23:43:15,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the teenager boys at the restaurant said he‚Äôd have taken the cat and fed it to his dog
24-06-2018T23:43:25,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a good thing I was not present
24-06-2018T23:44:05,Vatruvius,"One of the main characters, a Homo nasci, has a special power they do not know about. A power I do not know what it is! Problem, my world does not have magic so..."
