15-01-2022T17:14:13,KaplanSektyPieczarek,ok
15-01-2022T17:14:17,yFamous,Characters meeting themselves?
15-01-2022T17:14:34,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,What If? stories are always fun and the sketches only scratch the surface
15-01-2022T17:14:36,yFamous,Not 'themselves' but their modern versions?

15-01-2022T17:15:23,Twokinds,That's a pretty broad question. I can't really answer.
15-01-2022T17:15:30,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"@AlphaEyez dude, stop with capitalizing every word"
15-01-2022T17:15:35,Twokinds,years a practice
15-01-2022T17:15:40,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,haha
15-01-2022T17:15:42,R66Art,What a question x3
15-01-2022T17:15:45,Roughlandin,18 years and counting!
15-01-2022T17:15:50,KuroSuki64,Xd
15-01-2022T17:15:50,CrRAR,also sam & colin not going anywhere = just more thoughts of them staying cozy at home
15-01-2022T17:15:50,R66Art,Hey everyone!

15-01-2022T17:16:39,MadGod317,Welcome Neon!
15-01-2022T17:16:46,ProsePro7,It would be cool if Tom did a side comic not focused on the main story.  The snow sneps or Colin and Sam side comic would be a welcome aside.
15-01-2022T17:16:47,Roughlandin,But capitalizing every word makes your comments... kinda hard to read
15-01-2022T17:16:57,KuroSuki64,"A little, but yes"
15-01-2022T17:17:00,KaplanSektyPieczarek,It's just... weird
15-01-2022T17:17:10,KuroSuki64,HI EVERYONE THIS IS ME TRYING TO READ MY OWN COMMENT
15-01-2022T17:17:14,Mediawatcher37,Seeing a Brin and snep side story would be amazing 
15-01-2022T17:17:22,KuroSuki64,See?
15-01-2022T17:17:29,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,"Multiverse seems to be the thing now so I do like the AU sketches. If they were turned into one-off comics, I'd have to take time off from work and life to read them"
15-01-2022T17:17:38,CrRAR,sensational headline strategy
15-01-2022T17:17:49,Roughlandin,Oooooooh Brin gets a tail hijinks
15-01-2022T17:18:10,InTheLionsDen,A tail of tails.

15-01-2022T17:18:25,CrimsonQuill086,I'll give you three guesses as to which one...and the first two don't count
15-01-2022T17:18:32,KaplanSektyPieczarek,One question to everyone: What's your most favorite crossover with Twokinds? Mine is Ace Attorney

15-01-2022T17:22:07,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,"The Keith/Nat relationship is incredibly complex and dynamic. The best part about it is that they keep evolving as a couple. Just well done.

Alaric... I just identify with on a personal level. The best characters are those you can relate to IMO"

15-01-2022T17:25:39,CrimsonQuill086,I'd say my fave fanart so far is that pic someone did of Raine fighting Euchre...

15-01-2022T17:26:12,Twokinds,I'm definitely not making 3d models of all the characters haha

15-01-2022T17:44:44,CrRAR,Sing 2 starts off strong but the middle kinda drags
15-01-2022T17:44:46,SpazztasticKiwi,encanto remids me too much of the same stuff I dealt with growing up 
15-01-2022T17:44:57,Roughlandin,Ah I get that

15-01-2022T17:50:45,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ve seen baby Nibbly 
15-01-2022T17:50:55,Roughlandin,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
15-01-2022T17:50:57,Roughlandin,So smol
15-01-2022T17:50:57,SpazztasticKiwi,but who’d like to see newborn maeve 
15-01-2022T17:51:06,KaplanSektyPieczarek,@Roughlandin You wrote garbage? It isn't a garbage because it's better than mine
15-01-2022T17:51:08,Roughlandin,"We've seen kitten Maeve, right?"
15-01-2022T17:51:13,BadFoMo,Yep.
15-01-2022T17:51:14,CrimsonQuill086,"The important thing with art is to just...well...draw, I suppose"
15-01-2022T17:51:18,CrRAR,"not newborn, but yes out in the garden"
15-01-2022T17:51:32,CrimsonQuill086,"I get hung up on perfectionism, but when I let the pen flow, it makes some interesting stuff"
15-01-2022T17:51:47,CrimsonQuill086,And the most spontaneous doodles can be the best learning method
15-01-2022T17:51:47,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"There's no such thing like ""enough Maeve"""
15-01-2022T17:52:03,Roughlandin,The first real story I wrote was a Young Author's project for school.
15-01-2022T17:52:07,SpazztasticKiwi,wee lil bundle of fuzz
15-01-2022T17:52:08,CrimsonQuill086,"A dog here, maybe sketch that view outside? Or what if this character said that and so on?"
15-01-2022T17:52:12,Roughlandin,"It was called ""This Story Won't Win""."
15-01-2022T17:52:17,Roughlandin,...It came in Second Place.

15-01-2022T17:53:07,ProsePro7,Alpha need to describe that stuff
15-01-2022T17:53:09,Roughlandin,Our teacher actually bound them into little books
15-01-2022T17:53:12,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"@AlphaEyez warn that some of your work is NSFW next time,ok?"
15-01-2022T17:53:22,AlphaEyez,Ok Sorry

15-01-2022T17:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,nsfw links aren’t allowed period 
15-01-2022T17:53:52,Roughlandin,...Also self promotion of any kind is sort of against chat rules
15-01-2022T17:53:58,AlphaEyez,sorry
15-01-2022T17:54:11,AlphaEyez,im not trying to do anything

15-01-2022T17:55:25,ZapiliDver,"Kap, just use  AD&D version 2"

15-01-2022T17:57:10,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi I think that one was already done.
15-01-2022T17:57:36,Roughlandin,Chat rules are pretty easy. Basically don't spam or be a jerk.
15-01-2022T17:58:01,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,What @Roughlandin said. Pretty hard to do in here actually
15-01-2022T17:58:15,Roughlandin,Other than that. Describe links before posting. Don't link to NSFW stuff. And don't use chat to self promote
15-01-2022T17:58:15,CrimsonQuill086,I...may have broken a...few in my first year or two
15-01-2022T17:58:26,CrimsonQuill086,B-but I'm better now! I swear! Heheheh...
15-01-2022T17:58:41,Roughlandin,I'm pretty sure Ord kicked me on my first night for overusing Capslock
15-01-2022T17:58:47,Roughlandin,"...Also, don't use capslock"
15-01-2022T17:58:48,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Hey Rough a question?
15-01-2022T17:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora glaring at trace sleeping peacefully as she suffers from pregnancy insomnia

15-01-2022T17:59:12,ProsePro7,I got kicked by Tom himself so that is a badge of honor
15-01-2022T17:59:27,CrimsonQuill086,I think I remember that stream
15-01-2022T17:59:31,CrimsonQuill086,T'was...eventful.
15-01-2022T17:59:32,ZapiliDver,I got banned by Ord once =)
15-01-2022T17:59:33,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"How many main characters should die in a story? One, two or three"

15-01-2022T17:59:53,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t poke the artist 
15-01-2022T17:59:57,Roughlandin,"Depends on the size of the story, Kap"
15-01-2022T18:00:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"& don’t tap on the glass, it scares him"
15-01-2022T18:00:10,KaplanSektyPieczarek,So two
15-01-2022T18:00:11,Roughlandin,My BIG project I'm working on has three main characters
15-01-2022T18:00:13,AlphaEyez,Not Trying To Annoy Anyone Just Trying To Stay Out Of Trouble 
15-01-2022T18:00:27,KaplanSektyPieczarek,...
15-01-2022T18:00:30,CrimsonQuill086,And sometimes no one needs to die
15-01-2022T18:00:30,Roughlandin,"Don't stress, Alpha"
15-01-2022T18:01:02,Roughlandin,"Character death should only serve the plot. Good rule to have, Quill"
15-01-2022T18:01:16,Mediawatcher37,Tom had his post removed by teddy one time
15-01-2022T18:01:19,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,@AlphaEyez this is a very forgiving chat. Just learn as you go and move on
15-01-2022T18:01:33,Roughlandin,"More than one time, Media"
