07-01-2022T03:36:31,Twokinds,The art of hand painting food is half the fun.
07-01-2022T03:36:52,SageSaga,yeah but im not good at it and i want a quick way to get this done XD
07-01-2022T04:06:09,ZRO4825,"Okay, caught a glimpse of happy Aiyah face there on alt-tabbing back over, and that was cute AF :joy:"
07-01-2022T04:17:56,SageSaga,man the book i read last night was pretty good-
07-01-2022T04:25:12,Twokinds,Which one?
07-01-2022T04:28:46,SageSaga,Hell Mode
07-01-2022T04:29:07,Twokinds,Sounds intense
07-01-2022T04:29:54,SageSaga,its an isekai where the MC is looking for a real hardcore game thats really difficult- and ends up getting reincarnated isekaid as his choices
07-01-2022T04:30:31,SageSaga,"there is a ranking system for ""jobs"" and you can get access to better ranked jobs if you choose a harder version of the game - but there are huge penalties"
07-01-2022T04:31:45,SageSaga,so he picked the hardest mode and the hardest job- and turns out its also an unfinished job sooo- when the priest try to find out what this childs ability is- he comes up as not having one so hes kinda seen as trash-
07-01-2022T04:32:10,SageSaga,his stats all seem super low but his stats are all relative to his highest possible stats
07-01-2022T04:33:08,SageSaga,"so- if your stats are graded at E-A, all his stats appear as E because his max is just so high "
07-01-2022T04:33:44,SageSaga,he is weak- he just grows and has some crazy abilities- but he also earns XP like 100 times slower than normal people
07-01-2022T04:34:27,SageSaga,its this great mix of him actually not being crazy strong- but also being able to be completely OP if he does stuff just right
07-01-2022T04:37:13,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, this is sounding familiar."
07-01-2022T04:37:26,Twokinds,I think you mentioned this one before. Sounds interesting!
07-01-2022T04:37:49,SageSaga,yeah it was pretty sweet and it is very number crunchy
07-01-2022T04:38:08,SageSaga,but i love this idea that- your stats in this world are more important than vital spots
07-01-2022T04:38:49,SageSaga,"he can allocate these items to affect his stats and he just goes ""SCREW IT"" and sets everything to endurance so this monster just keep trying to chomp on him but it just CANT KILL HIM"
07-01-2022T04:40:28,SageSaga,so like- in this world- an assassin can try to stab you in the heart- or slit your throat- but if you have like 5000 endurance- they just cant even cut you
07-01-2022T04:41:52,SageSaga,this one guy has a weapon pierce right through his metal armor- but the weapon just suddenly stops right on the guys skin- and its like- why do you even bother wearing armor? - turns out he was using a skill that boosts his endurance but- still awesome XD
07-01-2022T04:42:27,SageSaga,the little art pages though- kinda suck- not great art for such cool concepts XD
07-01-2022T04:43:48,SageSaga,but anywho- im done!
07-01-2022T04:44:23,Dadrobit,Right on man! Thanks for the stream!
07-01-2022T04:44:53,SageSaga,take care everyone! hope you all have a great night-day- whatever! i will be back in 10 hours and 15ish minutes?

07-01-2022T20:12:22,KuroSuki64,Dead or Alive
07-01-2022T20:12:26,ZapiliDver,Damn time zones.....
07-01-2022T20:14:51,Ordithus,Zap bot beat the patreon notification
07-01-2022T20:15:22,ZapiliDver,"Funny, it's works from patreon emails"
07-01-2022T20:15:38,ZapiliDver,That usually add 1-3 minutes lag
07-01-2022T20:16:09,KuroSuki64,hi zapili
07-01-2022T20:16:20,ZapiliDver,Hi Kuro
07-01-2022T20:16:30,KuroSuki64,thanks for the
07-01-2022T20:16:34,KuroSuki64,advice
07-01-2022T20:16:37,KuroSuki64,yesterday
07-01-2022T20:23:41,KuroSuki64,https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html?units=metric
07-01-2022T20:27:41,KuroSuki64,the beginning of a new era to astronomy
07-01-2022T20:43:15,Ordithus,spaaaaace
07-01-2022T21:11:27,SpaceCadety,spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
07-01-2022T21:12:10,SpaceCadety,Those are going to be some impressive images from Webb.
07-01-2022T21:13:46,SpaceCadety,We just have to wait 6 months for those mirrors to be calibrated.
07-01-2022T21:14:26,Ordithus,even without I'm sure it can make some pretty pics
07-01-2022T21:15:23,KuroSuki64,it is specialized in near infrared and mid infrared light
07-01-2022T21:15:40,KuroSuki64,so it can catch a lot more of light than Hubble
07-01-2022T21:16:23,KuroSuki64,"Hubble is specialized in ultra violet, visible and near infrared light"
07-01-2022T21:17:23,KuroSuki64,the farthest galaxy picture ever taken is one named GN-z11
07-01-2022T21:17:42,KuroSuki64,which is 13.4 billion years away
07-01-2022T21:17:51,KuroSuki64,when its light reached Hubble
07-01-2022T21:18:15,KuroSuki64,now it should be at least 32 billion lightyears away
07-01-2022T21:18:23,KuroSuki64,that galaxy
07-01-2022T21:18:46,KuroSuki64,so now Webb can catch a lot more of details of those galaxies
07-01-2022T21:20:43,Dadrobit,It's kinda surreal. I remember being in elementary school learning about the James Webb telescope program.
07-01-2022T21:21:38,KuroSuki64,imagine just how many more galaxies and objects we can see than the Hubble Deep fields
07-01-2022T21:21:54,Ordithus,and those are incredible
07-01-2022T21:21:55,Dadrobit,It'll be awesome in the truest sense of the word
07-01-2022T21:21:59,Ordithus,yee
07-01-2022T21:22:22,KuroSuki64,what i want is to know is the mystery of the planet 9
07-01-2022T21:22:32,KuroSuki64,if is real or not
07-01-2022T21:23:35,Dadrobit,"Alas poor Pluto, I knew thee well."
07-01-2022T21:23:43,KuroSuki64,some scientists say that the mysterious Planet 9 was the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs
07-01-2022T21:24:02,KuroSuki64,its said to be of a size similar or bigger than Jupiter
07-01-2022T21:24:20,KuroSuki64,so I hope Webb solves that mystery
07-01-2022T21:26:52,KuroSuki64,here is a random astronomy question?
07-01-2022T21:27:03,KuroSuki64,which color is the Sun? 
07-01-2022T21:27:42,KuroSuki64,"white, yellow, or orange ?"
07-01-2022T21:27:57,Ordithus,blinding
07-01-2022T21:29:03,Dadrobit,It's white
07-01-2022T21:29:09,KuroSuki64,Correct
07-01-2022T21:29:21,Dadrobit,Took a bit of astronomy in college 
07-01-2022T21:29:28,KuroSuki64,the atmosphere makes the corona of the Sun look yellow and orange
07-01-2022T21:29:32,KuroSuki64,at sunset
07-01-2022T21:29:40,KuroSuki64,and sunrise
07-01-2022T21:29:56,Ordithus,"broad spectrum, emits from infrared through visible to UV"
07-01-2022T21:30:16,Ordithus,cuz its toasty warm :cw0lfmare-Naokifire:
07-01-2022T21:30:23,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce_xmas::ribbon: 
07-01-2022T21:30:23,KuroSuki64,thats the Hubble telescope spectrum
07-01-2022T21:30:32,KuroSuki64,"uv , visible and infrared"
07-01-2022T21:30:38,KuroSuki64,near infrared
07-01-2022T21:31:46,CrRAR,Webb gonna be epic :milky_way::ctwokinds-maddiessparkles_xmas:
07-01-2022T21:32:23,CrRAR,only 10+ year estimated lifespan though :cw0lfmare-EmberSad:
07-01-2022T21:32:27,KuroSuki64,https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campo_Ultra_Profundo_del_Hubble#/media/Archivo:HUDF.jpg
07-01-2022T21:32:49,KuroSuki64,the deepest image of the universe
07-01-2022T21:32:55,KuroSuki64,so epic
07-01-2022T21:33:13,CrRAR,I guess because it is a moving object it only has so much fuel for propulsion and trajectory changes
07-01-2022T21:33:24,KuroSuki64,indeed
07-01-2022T21:33:43,Ordithus,"that was the one from pointing hubble at ""nothing"", right?"
07-01-2022T21:33:55,Dadrobit,L2 is too hard to service at the moment. 
07-01-2022T21:34:05,CrRAR,at so far a distance is it... Voyager 2?... the transmissions speeds are hilariously slow
07-01-2022T21:34:08,KuroSuki64,it is 1.5 million km away
07-01-2022T21:34:12,KuroSuki64,so the Webb
07-01-2022T21:34:16,KuroSuki64,is decreasing
07-01-2022T21:34:21,KuroSuki64,its speed constatntly
07-01-2022T21:34:25,Dadrobit,"NASA is absolutely pursuing options to remotely service it in the future though, to be sure. "
07-01-2022T21:34:29,CrRAR,ah okay
07-01-2022T21:35:04,CrRAR,slowing down to a casual-stroll-through-space rate of speed
07-01-2022T21:35:17,CrRAR,:thumbsup: 
07-01-2022T21:35:39,KuroSuki64,because is getting out of Earth magnetic spectrum
07-01-2022T21:35:42,CrRAR,"""Wow guys, it's pretty awesome out here!"""
07-01-2022T21:35:50,CrRAR,ah okay
07-01-2022T21:35:58,KuroSuki64,So it it goes
07-01-2022T21:36:02,KuroSuki64,to Jupiter
07-01-2022T21:36:06,KuroSuki64,the speed
07-01-2022T21:36:09,KuroSuki64,will increase
07-01-2022T21:36:15,KuroSuki64,by at least
07-01-2022T21:36:21,KuroSuki64,123 times
07-01-2022T21:36:24,CrRAR,haha
07-01-2022T21:36:25,KuroSuki64,i mean 12
07-01-2022T21:36:29,KuroSuki64,times
07-01-2022T21:36:46,KuroSuki64,beacuse
07-01-2022T21:36:54,KuroSuki64,of the Jupiter magnetic
07-01-2022T21:36:58,KuroSuki64,spectrum
07-01-2022T21:37:03,CrRAR,"you know, the format you're responding in messages I'm reading it in William Shatner voice xD"
07-01-2022T21:37:12,Ordithus,haha
07-01-2022T21:37:20,KuroSuki64,the one who discovered Uranus
07-01-2022T21:37:24,KuroSuki64,makes sense
07-01-2022T21:37:31,KuroSuki64,Hershel
07-01-2022T21:37:34,KuroSuki64,William
07-01-2022T21:41:20,KuroSuki64,"Well, i have to go, bye everyone, see ya.  :D"
07-01-2022T21:41:20,CrRAR,:apple::chipmunk:
07-01-2022T21:41:26,Ordithus,bye!
07-01-2022T21:41:30,CrRAR,see ya kuro!
07-01-2022T21:41:34,Dadrobit,o/
07-01-2022T21:41:38,CrRAR,:v:
