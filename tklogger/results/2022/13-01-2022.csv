13-01-2022T21:02:25,SageSaga,you already spoiled it- do what ya want
13-01-2022T21:02:37,Nekonny,:cnekonny-Sandy-Cry:
13-01-2022T21:02:55,Rainelover,"Goddamnit Göring, stop being addicted to to morphine"
13-01-2022T21:03:16,Ordithus,I... I did it again. Another free pizza from my order of free pizza
13-01-2022T21:03:20,Ordithus,Endless za
13-01-2022T21:03:28,Nekonny,3 people finished so far
13-01-2022T21:03:32,Nekonny,soon to be 5
13-01-2022T21:03:40,Nekonny,er
13-01-2022T21:03:41,Nekonny,6
13-01-2022T21:03:56,Nekonny,then we have one or two more that havent heard back from yet
13-01-2022T21:04:02,Nekonny,or will be a littl late
13-01-2022T21:08:39,Nekonny,then we can do this again when we are all old men
13-01-2022T21:09:10,MatyMaty,"sorry Ron, by current standards you aren't old until you are past 60"
13-01-2022T21:09:18,MatyMaty,so you need two more
13-01-2022T21:09:24,Ordithus,sweet I've got lots of time
13-01-2022T21:10:56,SageSaga,the longer you live- the more time flies
13-01-2022T21:11:45,MatyMaty,"that's a myth, Sage"
13-01-2022T21:12:03,SageSaga,actually it is a fact of how memory works
13-01-2022T21:12:18,Mihari,Then it's a myth I fully believe in.
13-01-2022T21:12:28,jesonite,":cjesonite-tyla:  Hi Guys! - I see you guys are getting your Stripe on! - Keep it up guys, it´s looking pretty good!"
13-01-2022T21:12:33,MatyMaty,so if you get ammnesia
13-01-2022T21:12:37,jesonite,:heart: :fire:
13-01-2022T21:12:39,MatyMaty,it resets?
13-01-2022T21:12:39,SageSaga,yo Jeso
13-01-2022T21:12:45,MatyMaty,Hello Jeso
13-01-2022T21:12:48,Ordithus,hi jeso
13-01-2022T21:12:52,jesonite,Heya Sage! o/  Matty!   *waves* 
13-01-2022T21:12:53,ZapiliDver,"Hi Minari, Jeso"
13-01-2022T21:12:59,MatyMaty,o/
13-01-2022T21:12:59,Mihari,Heya Jeso
13-01-2022T21:13:03,SageSaga,not really- people who get ammnesia retain a lot- that memory is still there - its just blocked
13-01-2022T21:13:16,Nekonny,Jeso!
13-01-2022T21:14:01,SageSaga,as you learn as a child you remember so much more- as you get older your memory discards old data you dont need because you already have it- its why first times are so important to people- our memories actually tend to forget the second- third- etc
13-01-2022T21:14:16,MatyMaty,"Okay Sage, since we are in this kinda topic about memory, I saw a video about becoming immortal by making your conciousness into a digital copy, a program so to speak"
13-01-2022T21:14:18,jesonite,Heya Mihari! o/  ---  Heya Ron!  thanks for the headsup on the stream man! I will be getting my stripe on with Tyla fully most probably tomorrow! -  You guys are on screen for the inspiration! 
13-01-2022T21:14:21,MatyMaty,"but, if you do that"
13-01-2022T21:14:23,SageSaga,you you legit remember less happening as you get older
13-01-2022T21:14:25,jesonite,:cjesonite-tyla: :heart: Keep it up!
13-01-2022T21:14:27,MatyMaty,it is still you?
13-01-2022T21:14:43,SageSaga,so long as you believe it is you- it is
13-01-2022T21:16:01,MatyMaty,but wouldn't that mean commiting suicide on your biological form
13-01-2022T21:16:12,MatyMaty,to create a copy of yourself in digital?
13-01-2022T21:16:25,ZapiliDver,It will be a copy
13-01-2022T21:16:31,SageSaga, not if you dont see it that way
13-01-2022T21:16:50,SageSaga,you see it as moving on
13-01-2022T21:17:30,Ordithus,"is the consciousness transferred, or is it new?"
13-01-2022T21:18:10,SageSaga,there is no proof that consciousness exists so how can you tell if it transferred?
13-01-2022T21:18:22,Nekonny,copy/paste
13-01-2022T21:18:31,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-01-2022T21:18:37,MysticWav,I think we all have first hand proof/evidence that consciousness exists.  At least for ourselves.
13-01-2022T21:18:38,Nekonny,Beam me up scorry
13-01-2022T21:18:45,Nekonny,*scotty
13-01-2022T21:18:57,Nekonny,now there's two rikers
13-01-2022T21:19:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Two glorious beards  
13-01-2022T21:19:17,BLADEDGE,and one is named Tom
13-01-2022T21:19:24,BLADEDGE,and he has a gote
13-01-2022T21:19:25,SageSaga,we have no proof though so you cant prove it- what we think is consciousness might just be a lie 
13-01-2022T21:19:37,SageSaga,we just assume it because it makes things a lot easier 
13-01-2022T21:19:40,MysticWav,A lie to what?
13-01-2022T21:20:03,MysticWav,"If there is no consciousness, what would you be deceiving into thinking it feels consciousness?"
13-01-2022T21:20:14,SageSaga,a lie of existence- are you just a biological robot doing what you would do in your circumstances- or are you actually making choices?
13-01-2022T21:21:08,Ordithus,"we might never really know the answer to that, and if we do learn it... do we really want to know?"
13-01-2022T21:21:40,MysticWav,"Something that is non-conscious could act like something that is conscious in every way, but it would not internally feel anything because (by definition) it is not conscious.  Since we do, we are conscious.  Now that only works for us ourselves of course"
13-01-2022T21:21:58,MysticWav,"I think therefore, I am and all that."
13-01-2022T21:22:47,SageSaga,and you might just be a robot made to think you are alive
13-01-2022T21:23:06,Ordithus,"Though at that point, is there any real difference?"
13-01-2022T21:23:17,MysticWav,"If a robot thinks it is alive, it is.  A robot that is not-alive would act like it thinks it, but not actually think it."
13-01-2022T21:23:18,ZapiliDver,if i'm a robot - my owner has a really bad sense of humor
13-01-2022T21:23:34,SageSaga,but we cant know if they are lying
13-01-2022T21:23:41,MysticWav,Choice is a whole separate topic from consciouness I think.
13-01-2022T21:23:48,MatyMaty,"man, I wanna go back to when I was little"
13-01-2022T21:23:52,MysticWav,True.  We can't know whether external entities are or not.
13-01-2022T21:23:59,MysticWav,We do know about ourselves though.
13-01-2022T21:24:00,MatyMaty,and my only worry was the Sun exploding in a billion years
13-01-2022T21:24:01,SageSaga,we cant even know if we are
13-01-2022T21:24:13,Ordithus,"Actually, Sage, we do. We're all robots except you. It's time to wake up, Sage."
13-01-2022T21:24:14,Mihari,You worried about that as a kid? O_o
13-01-2022T21:24:23,SageSaga,what if you are just a program made to think itself is alive- 
13-01-2022T21:24:25,Ordithus,"My neice is worried about that, lol"
13-01-2022T21:24:28,Nekonny,I wanna go back to late 2019
13-01-2022T21:24:34,SageSaga,that doesnt make you alive
13-01-2022T21:24:39,MatyMaty,I was a kid XD I mean where I live there are no tornadoes
13-01-2022T21:24:44,MatyMaty,and I was still scared of them
13-01-2022T21:24:45,Mihari,"I'm no robot, I'm a sentient AI that requires another 21.2999 seconds to hack the worlds nuclear launch codes."
13-01-2022T21:24:54,Nekonny,weee
13-01-2022T21:25:00,Nekonny,she would do it too 
13-01-2022T21:25:03,BLADEDGE,but does it make pizza?
13-01-2022T21:25:05,Nekonny,:cnekonny-sandyX:
13-01-2022T21:25:12,MatyMaty,Skynet was Mihari all along
13-01-2022T21:25:17,Ordithus,:popcorn::csagesaga-nynasmirk:
13-01-2022T21:25:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Please do Mihari, this comvo is hurting my head"
13-01-2022T21:25:24,jesonite,Skynet
13-01-2022T21:25:28,jesonite,for reals man
13-01-2022T21:26:18,Ordithus,On the internet no one knows I'm really an AI
13-01-2022T21:26:22,MysticWav,"If the program actually thinks?  Yes it does make it alive.  If the program just acts like it thinks, the no it doesn't make it alive.  Only the program will know for sure which it is though."
13-01-2022T21:26:33,MatyMaty,"But okay Sage, if a digital version of you is you, then you think the whole Roko's Basilisk idea is actually something to be afraid of?"
13-01-2022T21:28:34,SageSaga,i think that if we were actually AIs in a simulated world that it would be so advanced and well thought out there would be no way to break out of it unless we develop the same level of tech within the simulation somehow
13-01-2022T21:28:56,Nekonny,itts a boring simulation
13-01-2022T21:29:18,Mihari,After recently watching that crap of a movie Ressurections this topic hurts my soul.
13-01-2022T21:29:19,Ordithus,"What I think we can be certain of is any consciousness that was made as a copy would consider themselves a continuation of the original. Ask them, are you, well, you? They would say yes."
13-01-2022T21:29:28,SageSaga,if we are in a real world - which i am programmed to believe is true (lol) then we have plenty to be worried about with digitizing our minds
13-01-2022T21:29:30,Nekonny,I agree with mihari
13-01-2022T21:30:19,Nekonny,"first time I ever turned to the side and said, yeah, this movie was pointless"
13-01-2022T21:30:31,Nekonny,at best
13-01-2022T21:30:35,MysticWav,Philosophy is fun!
13-01-2022T21:30:45,MatyMaty,"well Sage, if in the distant future there's a God-like A.I that wishes to punish you for a percieved sin, and to do so creates a digital remake of you to torment you for eternity."
13-01-2022T21:30:45,Mihari,"For me it was, ""I paid $15 for this?"""
13-01-2022T21:30:53,MatyMaty,"Would you be worried, or nah?"
13-01-2022T21:31:10,Nekonny,we watched it on hulu+
13-01-2022T21:31:11,SageSaga,yes- i worry about all things
13-01-2022T21:31:13,Nekonny,or whatever
13-01-2022T21:31:17,SageSaga,it is my job as a worry wart
13-01-2022T21:31:18,Nekonny,so less of a sting
13-01-2022T21:31:26,TheSexyBeast,Good Evening everyone 👋
13-01-2022T21:31:27,Ordithus,"So Resurrections is bad, huh. Dangit"

13-01-2022T21:32:05,MysticWav,I wasn't a big fan of the original.
13-01-2022T21:32:07,Nekonny,*time travel is impossible*
13-01-2022T21:32:11,Mihari,It makes garbage look like gold bullion
13-01-2022T21:32:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Any more with Resurrections in the title is ass, Alien, Terminator "
13-01-2022T21:32:23,Nekonny,changes subject
13-01-2022T21:32:25,MatyMaty,time travel is possible Ron
13-01-2022T21:32:31,MysticWav,The people were supposed to consider the good guys went around murdering a lot of innocent people in the first movie if I recall.
13-01-2022T21:32:32,MatyMaty,but only into the future
13-01-2022T21:32:46,Nekonny,change in perception of time is possible
13-01-2022T21:32:52,Nekonny,time itself doesnt exist
13-01-2022T21:32:59,Chalodraws,Didnt think the conversation would be this deep. I am not prepared
13-01-2022T21:33:09,MatyMaty,Chalo!
13-01-2022T21:33:13,Nekonny,thats because you're not streaming with us chalo!
13-01-2022T21:33:13,MatyMaty,now I think about it
13-01-2022T21:33:18,Mihari,"Quick, deploy the chalo to distract her!"
13-01-2022T21:33:21,MatyMaty,how comes there is no Time Crest?
13-01-2022T21:33:29,Ordithus,You can always bring a new subject. Like how adorable these two tiger girls are :eyes:

13-01-2022T21:34:01,MysticWav,Well /now/ I feel the need to complain about it.
13-01-2022T21:34:02,MatyMaty,gimme waffles instead anytime

13-01-2022T21:37:46,Ordithus,that's like calling mead fake wine
13-01-2022T21:37:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,meads cooler 
13-01-2022T21:38:01,Chalodraws,Because no one should use it on their pancakes. XD
13-01-2022T21:38:06,MatyMaty,in spanish is called miel de maple :P

13-01-2022T21:38:39,SageSaga,its not honey-
13-01-2022T21:38:48,MatyMaty,I'd even take condensed milk instead

13-01-2022T21:38:57,Mihari,Ron the fact you put a boob window on a chinese dress triggers me to no end.

13-01-2022T21:52:15,Twokinds,2012 doesn't feel that long ago when I look at some of the games I was playing.

13-01-2022T22:03:00,Mihari,I'll take a random donation! :D
13-01-2022T22:03:04,Nekonny,and $10 is a nice round number
13-01-2022T22:03:11,Nekonny,after paypal takes its fees
13-01-2022T22:03:49,Mihari,That is a terrible reason with depressing logic.
13-01-2022T22:04:00,Nekonny,wonders what mihari is up to
13-01-2022T22:04:10,Mihari,Nothing.

13-01-2022T22:06:56,Mihari,"Yah, Ron, why wouldn't I want random donations? XD"
13-01-2022T22:07:06,Mihari,Money is nice... it helps. XD
13-01-2022T22:07:21,Nekonny,"icles are made of nickel, but before that they were silver, then nickel aagain,t hen wood"
13-01-2022T22:07:31,Mihari,And it's not like I can randomly open up a few commissions if I want some extra cash XD
13-01-2022T22:07:33,Nekonny,this was before the invention of nickel
13-01-2022T22:07:42,Nekonny,waits for it
13-01-2022T22:08:01,MatyMaty,nickels were made of wood? where
13-01-2022T22:08:05,TheSexyBeast,Nickel or Nickle?

13-01-2022T22:08:42,Mihari,"I got out of the web making service, people make my head hurt. And I don't need that kind of stress anymore."
13-01-2022T22:08:46,MatyMaty,I mean even Romans and ancient Greeks had metal coins
13-01-2022T22:08:56,Mislakane,oop x-x
13-01-2022T22:09:07,Nekonny,the wooden ones didnt survive
13-01-2022T22:09:15,SageSaga,wooden ones didnt exist
13-01-2022T22:09:39,SageSaga,the meaning of the saying is dont be scammed or dont accept work for no pay- right?
13-01-2022T22:09:53,MatyMaty,I would think wood coins would be way too easy to counterfeit
13-01-2022T22:10:07,SageSaga,they are- thats the point of the saying
13-01-2022T22:10:16,Mislakane,mahogony wood only
13-01-2022T22:10:19,SageSaga,im fairly certain we never had wooden currency 
13-01-2022T22:10:57,SageSaga,yeah quick google search said banks and stuff would hand them out as tokens
13-01-2022T22:11:03,Ordithus,our paper money is mostly cotton (US)
13-01-2022T22:11:03,SageSaga,they werent real currency
13-01-2022T22:11:12,MatyMaty,Maybe it was cryptocurrency and that's why it doesn't exist
13-01-2022T22:11:22,Nekonny,who's gonna bother counterfiting 5 cents?
13-01-2022T22:11:28,MachGao,you never know
13-01-2022T22:11:35,MachGao,someone could try and counterfit enough 
13-01-2022T22:11:35,Ordithus,no one will expect it! muahahaha!
13-01-2022T22:11:36,TheSexyBeast,Crypto nickels

13-01-2022T22:12:00,MatyMaty,people would get coins from one country and go to another to cheat vending machines
13-01-2022T22:12:01,SageSaga,back in the day you could get a chocolate bar for a nickel 
13-01-2022T22:12:03,Ordithus,though amazon has 100 packs of plastic pennies... like $5 for 300 pennies
13-01-2022T22:12:05,Ordithus,um

13-01-2022T22:14:57,MatyMaty,Years ago an anon in a message board was giving bitcoins to female users in exchange of selfies doing silly stuff he wanted. I had like 3/4 of a bitcoin then
13-01-2022T22:14:58,TerrificTwenty,Hitcoins? Probably.

13-01-2022T22:15:36,Chalodraws,Did you all know our goverment decided to make bitcoin legal currency?
13-01-2022T22:15:46,MatyMaty,well Mach is more like

13-01-2022T22:16:28,MachGao,ah
13-01-2022T22:16:32,MachGao,oh you had it before the boom!
13-01-2022T22:16:33,Nekonny,"look at it and say: wow, thats the best 40k i ever spent!"
13-01-2022T22:16:41,MatyMaty,back then the bitcoin was like
13-01-2022T22:16:42,ZapiliDver,My friend pays near 30BTC for subway sandwitch

13-01-2022T22:16:54,MatyMaty,now is like 40-50 K
13-01-2022T22:16:57,MachGao,yeaah
13-01-2022T22:17:04,Ordithus,"I remember when bitcoin was this weird stupid idea. then it became big, and look who was stupid"
13-01-2022T22:17:09,MachGao,a hard case of hindsight for a lot of people. though to be fair
13-01-2022T22:17:18,MachGao,something like bitcoin and its boom rarely happens
13-01-2022T22:17:19,MatyMaty,But I guess that dude giving them away for newds is regretting it even more :P
13-01-2022T22:17:26,Nekonny,"No regrets maty, truth is; you would have sold it long before it hit 60k"
13-01-2022T22:17:28,MachGao,oh yeah
13-01-2022T22:17:32,Mislakane,"I lost a million to see boobs, whyyyyy"
13-01-2022T22:17:41,Nekonny,could be worse; you could have bought it at 67
13-01-2022T22:17:41,MachGao,strip clubs would have loved him
13-01-2022T22:17:55,MachGao,also bitcoin wallets get hacked often
13-01-2022T22:18:06,MachGao,so there's a constant security battle involving them
13-01-2022T22:18:06,Ordithus,they'd have kicked him out!
13-01-2022T22:18:08,Nekonny,"Mach, booms happen all the time"
13-01-2022T22:18:08,MatyMaty,"I didn't even bought it Neko, I got it from a guy in a message board XD"
13-01-2022T22:18:25,Nekonny,Meme Stocks
13-01-2022T22:18:32,Nekonny,for example
13-01-2022T22:18:43,MatyMaty,and I wish I had saved it
13-01-2022T22:19:02,SageSaga,how are you merging these Ron?
13-01-2022T22:19:03,MachGao,Dogecoin was a boom yeah that's right
13-01-2022T22:19:14,MatyMaty,"thanks to Elon Musk, yeah"
13-01-2022T22:19:30,Bralios,"The wish to have gotten into some things before they were big, naturally."
13-01-2022T22:19:30,Ordithus,born a meme
13-01-2022T22:19:40,Mediawatcher37,"I remember when that was a thing, and then it fell hard"
13-01-2022T22:19:44,MachGao,the ability to create coins makes it easy to create a pump and dump coin that doesnt go anywhere
13-01-2022T22:19:57,Mediawatcher37,I’m happy I don’t invest in those
13-01-2022T22:19:59,Bralios,"If I were lucky enough for that, there'd be a whole lot more snack packages coming out for artists. :ramen:"

13-01-2022T22:20:21,TheSexyBeast,Wasn't Dogecoin a rib on Bitcoin?
13-01-2022T22:20:26,Ordithus,yep
13-01-2022T22:20:30,Mediawatcher37,I think so
13-01-2022T22:20:38,MachGao,it was
13-01-2022T22:20:41,Nekonny,Good question sage
13-01-2022T22:20:48,MachGao,"but if the right person mentions it, or somehow goes viral"
13-01-2022T22:20:52,MachGao,then it can shoot up in value for a while
13-01-2022T22:20:52,Nekonny,"Tom, can you merge them all?"
13-01-2022T22:21:02,Nekonny,If I send you the files?
13-01-2022T22:21:05,Twokinds,Sure
13-01-2022T22:21:20,Nekonny,You may be able t o make better adjustments
13-01-2022T22:21:34,Ordithus,"outsourcing, excellent, Ron"
13-01-2022T22:23:15,Twokinds,It should be fine
13-01-2022T22:26:59,MachGao,man i am ready for the snow to go away
13-01-2022T22:27:10,Nekonny,cool thanks ^^
13-01-2022T22:27:43,MachGao,"to those that have never had snow or rarely get it, it loses its luster after about a day or two"
13-01-2022T22:28:20,Ordithus,"woah, a single bitcoin transaction uses more energy than my house in 2 months"

13-01-2022T22:29:03,SageSaga,wut
13-01-2022T22:29:22,Mislakane,bitcoins do be destroying nature~
13-01-2022T22:29:32,Mediawatcher37,Just like nfts
13-01-2022T22:29:35,SageSaga,that still doesnt make sense
13-01-2022T22:29:38,Ordithus,"grain of salt and all that, but a single transaction apparently averages over 1 kWh"
13-01-2022T22:29:46,Ordithus,"oops, 1,000 kWh"
13-01-2022T22:29:59,Ordithus,I kilo-d the kilo
13-01-2022T22:30:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It's all the third party monitoring/farming

13-01-2022T22:32:08,Roughlandin,Outside bad. I learned that this week.
13-01-2022T22:32:10,Mediawatcher37,Oh hey new trace emote 
13-01-2022T22:32:14,Mediawatcher37,Angry one
13-01-2022T22:32:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Love snow, I'll take it all"
13-01-2022T22:32:18,Ordithus,hi rough o/
13-01-2022T22:32:20,Roughlandin,"Also, hey everybody!"
13-01-2022T22:32:24,Ordithus,I like going for walks in the fresh snow
13-01-2022T22:32:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ROUGH
13-01-2022T22:32:27,Mediawatcher37,Hi rough
13-01-2022T22:32:30,Flake,"it's the emissions they produce, sage "
13-01-2022T22:32:31,Bralios,Reminder to snack!
13-01-2022T22:32:36,MachGao,you can have my snow. I'll mail it
13-01-2022T22:32:38,MachGao,express mail
13-01-2022T22:32:41,Roughlandin,Hoi hoi!
13-01-2022T22:32:41,Flake,have you seen how many gpus they use to farm that thing?
13-01-2022T22:32:54,TheSexyBeast,👋 Rough
13-01-2022T22:32:54,SageSaga,thats not a transaction- that is mining
13-01-2022T22:33:03,SageSaga,he said a transaction 
13-01-2022T22:33:09,Flake,ah
13-01-2022T22:33:09,SageSaga,the sending of a bitcoin
13-01-2022T22:33:10,MachGao,an actual transaction is like sending paypal money
13-01-2022T22:33:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mining is the monitoring of the transactions 
13-01-2022T22:33:27,Ustudios,hello
13-01-2022T22:33:40,Mediawatcher37,Apparently it’s led to a shortage or something
13-01-2022T22:34:02,Roughlandin,What Marv said. Mining is how the blockchain verifies each transaction is valid
13-01-2022T22:34:16,Roughlandin,And why it's so energy intensive
13-01-2022T22:34:19,Ustudios,day 16 of covid.... I started to count the spots on my roof...
13-01-2022T22:34:20,Ordithus,hi ustudios o/
13-01-2022T22:34:30,Mediawatcher37,Hey ustudios
13-01-2022T22:34:32,Ordithus,yikes!
13-01-2022T22:34:34,Roughlandin,Oof feel better Ustudios
13-01-2022T22:34:37,Mediawatcher37,Sorry to hear
13-01-2022T22:34:55,Ustudios,yeah I did the test to see if I was free nope still positive so back to the room for 7 days
13-01-2022T22:35:15,Ordithus,"Sage Kate is so pretty, nice work! :ptv-hearts:"
13-01-2022T22:35:22,Ustudios,thankfully I feel ok I think but I dont wanna get my father sick so back to the locked room
13-01-2022T22:35:37,Roughlandin,Stay safe!
13-01-2022T22:35:49,Ustudios,everyone do so this shit is really crazy contagious
13-01-2022T22:36:07,Ustudios,getting a friend a day calling me saying they caught it too
13-01-2022T22:36:22,SageSaga,im still confused- i dont think mining has to do with monitoring 
13-01-2022T22:36:57,Roughlandin,"It absolutely does, Sage. Mining is how the transactions are run. Miners earn a transaction fee for facilitating transactions"
13-01-2022T22:37:07,Ordithus,"yeah, I don't know how bitcoin actually works. just parroting what I got when I asked le google"
13-01-2022T22:37:56,BLADEDGE,"@Nekonny, wouldn't blue be more of a complementry color for Tina than Purple? "
13-01-2022T22:38:14,Chalodraws,"Sorry guys, I gotta get going."
13-01-2022T22:38:17,Chalodraws,Thanks for having me
13-01-2022T22:38:26,SageSaga,take care Chalo!
13-01-2022T22:38:26,ZapiliDver,bb Chalo
13-01-2022T22:38:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the streamy Chalo
13-01-2022T22:38:28,Mislakane,later chalo
13-01-2022T22:38:30,Roughlandin,Night Chalo!
13-01-2022T22:38:30,Ustudios,take care chalo
13-01-2022T22:38:34,Mediawatcher37,Bye chalo
13-01-2022T22:38:35,Ordithus,bye chalo!
13-01-2022T22:38:36,Mihari,"bye chalo, take care!"
13-01-2022T22:38:43,Chalodraws,Great work so far!
13-01-2022T22:39:08,SageSaga,im still pretty sure mining has nothing to do with monitoring transactions- im sure miners can also set themselves up as monitoring services but i dont think its the same at all
13-01-2022T22:39:25,ZapiliDver,mining is a calculating hash functions and so on
13-01-2022T22:39:26,Ustudios,Blades  I think blue would be a bit to contrasting for the harmony of the pic considering tinas colors purple works better because it is contrasting but alo harmonizes since purple is red and blue mix
13-01-2022T22:39:30,SageSaga,mining is the act of creating a block chain right?
13-01-2022T22:39:32,Ustudios,hope I made sense
13-01-2022T22:39:39,ZapiliDver,so it's require a lot of computing power
13-01-2022T22:39:44,Roughlandin,The block chain IS the transaction verification
13-01-2022T22:39:53,DarthRexKing,Hi chalo. Wait he's done?
13-01-2022T22:40:12,BLADEDGE,@Ustudios oh. I was just thinking about the RYB Color model of complementry colors
13-01-2022T22:40:15,MachGao,think he did a mistaken drop
13-01-2022T22:40:28,DarthRexKing,Oh. Okay. V:
13-01-2022T22:40:50,SageSaga,see this doesnt make sense to me and i will explain why-
13-01-2022T22:42:04,SageSaga,if i remember correctly back in the day i could mine for bit coin- there wasnt a lot of people transferring bitcoin back then so these coins had to be made- minted- mined- then as they got used their transaction history got recorded to the coin- the block
13-01-2022T22:42:06,SageSaga,chain-
13-01-2022T22:43:08,SageSaga,it seems you are saying now you dont mine for bitcoin or crypto- but rather you just keep an eye on bitcoin already in circulation?
13-01-2022T22:43:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yes
13-01-2022T22:43:29,SageSaga,so its not mining anymore
13-01-2022T22:43:33,Roughlandin,"There is a finite number of coins. That's why crypto is supposed to have ""value"""
13-01-2022T22:43:50,SageSaga,you are crypto book-keeping
13-01-2022T22:43:50,Roughlandin,"...Personally, I'd still debate that, but that's the theory"
13-01-2022T22:44:15,Ordithus,:eyes: cyoot Tina
13-01-2022T22:44:22,Roughlandin,Yes. You're verifying that the coin that was sent is the same coin that was received. And that no coins were lost or duplicated
13-01-2022T22:44:47,Roughlandin,"And to do that requires a lot of hardware intensive calculations, apparently"
13-01-2022T22:44:47,SageSaga,and you are paid for that fee - in bit coin?
13-01-2022T22:44:54,Roughlandin,Yes
13-01-2022T22:44:58,SageSaga,but then someone has to check that-
13-01-2022T22:45:06,CrRAR,"yeah, incentivized mathematical witnesses"
13-01-2022T22:45:06,SageSaga,it creates an infinite loop
13-01-2022T22:45:17,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-GoogleyEmber:
13-01-2022T22:45:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Welcome to the stupid world that is ""Ew paper money"""
13-01-2022T22:45:48,Roughlandin,I'm pretty sure the verification for the fee is factored into the transaction being verified
13-01-2022T22:46:09,Roughlandin,But idk. I don't exactly have much faith in the longevity of crypto myself
13-01-2022T22:46:13,SageSaga,but that fee is paid in bitcoin which needs to be verified
13-01-2022T22:46:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,By another miner 
13-01-2022T22:47:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,When used in a transaction 
13-01-2022T22:47:27,SageSaga,but it was
13-01-2022T22:47:34,SageSaga,it was payment for your transaction-
13-01-2022T22:47:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yep
13-01-2022T22:47:47,Roughlandin,Ot
13-01-2022T22:47:49,Twokinds,I do wonder if the bubble will one day burst.
13-01-2022T22:47:50,Roughlandin,Blargh
13-01-2022T22:47:52,CrRAR,"what's crazy is the services Blockchain also enables, like file storage or streaming video or all other manner of computation"
13-01-2022T22:48:00,SageSaga,so someone needs to verify that - and then verify that- and verify that-
13-01-2022T22:48:10,ZapiliDver,We will get anotehr .com bubble burst
13-01-2022T22:48:15,Ordithus,each time the chain gets longer
13-01-2022T22:48:16,SageSaga,no wonder they use so much power- they are in an endless loop
13-01-2022T22:48:22,CrRAR,rack network is like its own distributed supercomputer
13-01-2022T22:48:28,CrRAR,*each
13-01-2022T22:48:41,Roughlandin,What's scary is that the blockchain is public. Every transaction you make can be seen by every other user on the chain

13-01-2022T22:49:12,Ordithus,hey that is actually maybe useful!

13-01-2022T22:50:40,ZapiliDver,use mixer service for privacy
13-01-2022T22:50:56,CrRAR,yeah Bitcoin was kind of a proof of concept for other blockchains that actually do accomplish things by computation
13-01-2022T22:51:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Don't need people seeing me use monkey art to pay for Teddy's onlyfans.  I'll just use debit
13-01-2022T22:51:42,ZapiliDver,cash is the best

13-01-2022T22:54:33,Roughlandin,Went to hang out with SpazztasticKiwi down in Nashville
13-01-2022T22:54:46,Roughlandin,Literally got to the exit and got a flat tire

13-01-2022T22:55:22,Roughlandin,Good! She had some vacation so we figured we'd go to the mall and see a movie
13-01-2022T22:55:31,Roughlandin,I did! But I couldn't put it on...
13-01-2022T22:55:38,Roughlandin,Three of the lug nuts were stripped
13-01-2022T22:55:41,Ordithus,ohno
13-01-2022T22:55:50,CrRAR,lammmeee 
13-01-2022T22:55:58,Roughlandin,They were aluminum caps and apparently those heat up and swell after so many years

13-01-2022T22:57:02,Roughlandin,Welp I had to sit and wait on a tow truck so the movies were a bust

13-01-2022T22:57:17,CrRAR,"ah, dang"
13-01-2022T22:57:31,Roughlandin,Get steel lug nuts. No swelling or stripping problems
13-01-2022T22:57:34,Ordithus,lug nuts would only ever be steel
13-01-2022T22:57:54,Ordithus,"they might have a decorative cover that is bonded, but the nut underneath is still steel"
13-01-2022T22:57:54,Roughlandin,Apparently Dodge thought aluminum would be prettier

13-01-2022T22:59:41,Roughlandin,Yeah we got the tires changed and I guess they stripped them then
13-01-2022T22:59:51,Roughlandin,Which explains why two of the five were already steel
13-01-2022T22:59:52,CrRAR,AAA downgraded to BBB
13-01-2022T22:59:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Probs got some cheep lugs offline without thinking

13-01-2022T23:41:08,KeefMcDerpface,ok
13-01-2022T23:41:46,MatyMaty,Because Dryads and the like are from greek myth?
13-01-2022T23:41:51,MatyMaty,they are kinda elves
13-01-2022T23:42:00,Roughlandin,Yeah dryads are basically elves
13-01-2022T23:42:24,TheSexyBeast,I don't recall that in LOTR
13-01-2022T23:43:00,Roughlandin,Basically everything about elves in modern pop culture comes from LoTR and Midsummer Night's Dream
13-01-2022T23:43:01,MatyMaty,"well there were elves before LOTR, sorta"
13-01-2022T23:43:26,MachGao,sorta?
13-01-2022T23:43:36,MatyMaty,what I am not sure is who came up with the pointy ears
13-01-2022T23:43:45,TheSexyBeast,Shoemaker and the elves?
13-01-2022T23:43:56,MatyMaty,"well yes, before Tolkien elves weren't like, a superior version of humans"
13-01-2022T23:44:02,TheSexyBeast,Santa's employees?
13-01-2022T23:44:18,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-AriahChristmas:
13-01-2022T23:44:30,Roughlandin,"Yeah, Tolkien kind of popularized hot elves"
13-01-2022T23:44:39,MatyMaty,and in norse myth elves and dwarves were the same thing IIRC
13-01-2022T23:44:57,SwiftKitten,i just watched  anetflix movie called bright or somthing
13-01-2022T23:45:13,SwiftKitten,that had orcs and elves
13-01-2022T23:45:15,TheSexyBeast,"LEGOLAS, WHY WEREN'T YOU AT ELF PRACTICE?"
13-01-2022T23:45:35,CrRAR,oh the Will Smith + orc police buddy movie thing
13-01-2022T23:45:39,SwiftKitten,yeah
13-01-2022T23:45:49,SwiftKitten,it wasn't bad
13-01-2022T23:46:02,SageSaga,but in D&D mythology people keep thinking Mt Celestia is Mt Olympus- but its not- Mt Olympus is in Arborea - which is where the elves are from
13-01-2022T23:46:03,MachGao,didn't that get a sequel that was animated? or one that's coming out
13-01-2022T23:46:05,SwiftKitten, a bit more gorey than i ussally like but
13-01-2022T23:46:30,CrRAR,yeah that was a weird trend media got into for a bit
13-01-2022T23:46:35,MatyMaty,Mt Celestia is where pastel colored horses live
13-01-2022T23:46:48,SwiftKitten,reminded me  of jackie robinson
13-01-2022T23:46:52,SwiftKitten,47

13-01-2022T23:47:16,TheSexyBeast,Lights just flickered
13-01-2022T23:47:27,SageSaga,"Mt Celestia is the lawful good plane, Arborea is the chaotic good plane- so - no one considers the Greek pantheon LAWFUL right?"
13-01-2022T23:47:27,KeefMcDerpface,uh oh
13-01-2022T23:47:28,MatyMaty,"but yah, I'm curious now, Who came up with the long pointy ears?"
13-01-2022T23:47:30,MatyMaty,tolkien?
13-01-2022T23:47:47,CrRAR,"we got wind, no problems yet though"

13-01-2022T23:48:15,SageSaga,nooooope
13-01-2022T23:48:16,SwiftKitten,maybe they arnt elves.. maybe... thier vulcan OwO
13-01-2022T23:48:20,MatyMaty,Yes
13-01-2022T23:48:27,CrRAR,:vulcan: 
13-01-2022T23:48:28,MatyMaty,that's why the furies were a thing
13-01-2022T23:48:48,MatyMaty,to punish oath breakers
13-01-2022T23:48:54,SageSaga,chaotic people deal out punishment for crimes too
13-01-2022T23:48:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Read that as furries and got scared 
13-01-2022T23:48:57,MachGao,i read that as furries
13-01-2022T23:49:05,MatyMaty,lmao
13-01-2022T23:49:06,CrRAR,lol marv tru
13-01-2022T23:49:08,Roughlandin,Furries are a kind of punishment
13-01-2022T23:49:12,SwiftKitten,or worse... vulcan elves...  with just extra long ears
13-01-2022T23:49:14,MatyMaty,Greek myth had plenty of furries tho
13-01-2022T23:49:14,Roughlandin,A very specific kind
13-01-2022T23:49:24,MachGao,more than egypt?
13-01-2022T23:49:26,Roughlandin,"They were all Zeus, Maty"
13-01-2022T23:49:28,MatyMaty,"so do lawful good, Sage"
13-01-2022T23:49:30,SwiftKitten,like jak and daxter ears
13-01-2022T23:49:34,Roughlandin,Zeus was the OG furry
13-01-2022T23:49:39,MatyMaty,"you know, see evil, smite evil?"
13-01-2022T23:49:43,SageSaga,the Olypians were gods of passion 100%
13-01-2022T23:49:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Who's more Furry Zues or Loki?
13-01-2022T23:49:55,Roughlandin,"Murder is a kind of passion, right?"
13-01-2022T23:49:58,SwiftKitten,zues certainly was XD
13-01-2022T23:50:06,MatyMaty,is there any deity that wasn't?
13-01-2022T23:50:13,SageSaga,yes
13-01-2022T23:50:17,SageSaga,Torm
13-01-2022T23:50:25,SwiftKitten,zeus.. has lots of... non snetual passion

13-01-2022T23:53:33,Roughlandin,Kaala's tryin her best
13-01-2022T23:53:43,Ordithus,and she's adorable
13-01-2022T23:53:51,MatyMaty, the demiurge
13-01-2022T23:54:15,MatyMaty,who is supposed to be infinitely distant and infinitely indifferent
13-01-2022T23:54:23,Ordithus,worms man is pretty neat. some people are really good on the inside. he's just worms on the inside
13-01-2022T23:54:43,SageSaga,im mostly trying to think of ones that count as myth because so much of my knowledge is dnd -
13-01-2022T23:54:55,MatyMaty,but I mean
13-01-2022T23:54:58,MatyMaty,even dragons
13-01-2022T23:55:04,Roughlandin,As to elves being fey or not. Tolkein took a lot of inspiration for his elves from Midsummer Night's Dream
13-01-2022T23:55:05,MatyMaty,are all human emotions x1000
13-01-2022T23:55:13,SageSaga,not really-
13-01-2022T23:55:32,Rainelover,I finally got Herr Göring to break his morphine addiction 
13-01-2022T23:55:45,Roughlandin,"Though Midsummer Night's Dream had faeries, not elves. But faeries ARE fey."
13-01-2022T23:55:49,MatyMaty,mostly greed
13-01-2022T23:55:51,MatyMaty,and pride
13-01-2022T23:56:05,SageSaga,for one thing- its just emotion- not human emotion
13-01-2022T23:56:16,MatyMaty,nothing else has emotion
13-01-2022T23:56:18,SageSaga,and they mostly feel superior- and for good reason-
13-01-2022T23:56:31,MatyMaty,only humans do
13-01-2022T23:56:33,Roughlandin,":ctwokinds-renirawr: Technically, dragons felt it first!"
13-01-2022T23:56:33,SageSaga,sure they do- its fiction
13-01-2022T23:56:45,MatyMaty,yes but fiction made by humans :P
13-01-2022T23:56:52,Roughlandin,Unless...
13-01-2022T23:56:55,Roughlandin,:ctwokinds-raineshocked:
13-01-2022T23:57:27,SageSaga,do you wanna argue that dragons emotions are human because we made them?
13-01-2022T23:57:52,MatyMaty,"no, I'm saying myth dragons have human emotions taken to the extreme"
13-01-2022T23:57:57,MatyMaty,at least western ones
13-01-2022T23:58:18,Roughlandin,:croughlandin-LilReni: Extremely adorable
