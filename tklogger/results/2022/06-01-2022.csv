06-01-2022T20:14:19,SageSaga,i do really love this song
06-01-2022T20:14:43,SageSaga,its sung by 2 of my favorite artists as a collab XD

06-01-2022T20:19:17,MysticWav,Ord was by earlier saying he'd leave his request in a patreon message
06-01-2022T20:20:09,SageSaga,but patreon messaging system sucks T_T
06-01-2022T20:20:20,SageSaga,XD thanks for letting me know- i will check it now
06-01-2022T20:21:08,MysticWav,"Heh, what sucks about it?"
06-01-2022T20:21:32,ZapiliDver,"Patreon messaging is BS sometimes, i've got email with message and it's shown on patreon a day later"
06-01-2022T20:21:44,CrRAR,wow
06-01-2022T20:22:18,CrRAR,front ends sounds like it forgets to check with the backend there xD
06-01-2022T20:22:39,ZapiliDver,"i usually name this as a ""shitcode"""
06-01-2022T20:23:01,CrRAR,:ptv-laugh:
06-01-2022T20:25:05,SageSaga,the patreon messenger doesnt alert me and almost always says i have a message when i check it- even when i dont
06-01-2022T20:25:35,SageSaga,and the only way to tell i have a message is to go to it and verify- i get no alerts on my phone or email when i get it so thats a huuuuge problem
06-01-2022T20:26:05,SageSaga,then it doesnt have a good layout at all- its like using MIIRC on a website from the 90s
06-01-2022T20:26:43,ZapiliDver,two different bugs in one system. Veri goot codink
06-01-2022T20:27:01,MoonDance,defiantly something to give feedback to Patreon; I don't think they do a lot for their mobile
06-01-2022T20:27:34,ZapiliDver,"i think they don't care, as they don't care about their API"
06-01-2022T20:27:48,SageSaga,i already gave this feedback over and over- they dont care
06-01-2022T20:28:17,CrRAR,"the mobile app did update recently, it seems to work better maybe now they just have spaghetti code connecting all the newer stuff to the legacy parts"
06-01-2022T20:28:39,CrRAR,might explain why it seems so disjointed
06-01-2022T20:29:01,CrRAR,has it been recent that the messaging has been wonky?
06-01-2022T20:30:17,SageSaga,since it was a thing on the platform- they changed it once- honestly barely made any difference other than less people could say it flat out deleted messages randomly -
06-01-2022T20:30:31,SageSaga,and we have just that- a barely passing messaging system that is a pain to use
06-01-2022T20:31:14,CrRAR,classic case of SNAFU
06-01-2022T20:32:19,SageSaga,it works- thats all they care about- it just sucks to use- but so does their phone app
06-01-2022T20:32:38,SageSaga,it cant even look at half the data on your profile that you can on the website
06-01-2022T20:32:45,SageSaga,its just- not accessible from the app
06-01-2022T20:33:28,CrRAR,yeah I hate differences in functionality
06-01-2022T20:34:12,SageSaga,it might be a pain in the butt to click on links in the phone browser- but its way better than using that app that cant access half the info
06-01-2022T20:34:35,SageSaga,granted- the Patreon page isnt great either in general
06-01-2022T20:35:04,SageSaga,"the design is terrible, the links are all hidden under link names that dont associate with what you want and some links arent even accessible from the main link area"
06-01-2022T20:35:23,SageSaga,you need to go to a totally different part of the page to access stuff that should be under the left side links
06-01-2022T20:36:36,ZapiliDver,and desktop site works awfully in firefox
06-01-2022T20:37:07,ZapiliDver,"3-4 clicks on ""Load More"" and it start consume all cpu"
06-01-2022T20:37:41,CrRAR,yeah the content loading and the tags filtering becomes horribly sluggish
06-01-2022T20:38:04,MoonDance,"Patreon does has some flaws, which I can see why a handful of artist I watch been moving to just ko-fi"
06-01-2022T20:38:25,CrRAR,tru
06-01-2022T20:39:13,SageSaga,i have patreon and ko-fi but Ko-fi rarely brings anything in
06-01-2022T20:39:28,SageSaga,and then i have patreon and substar for the OTHER art
06-01-2022T20:40:30,MoonDance,"I see the other art brought up quite a bit of traction the last few months, which is always good"
06-01-2022T20:41:04,SageSaga,i hope it grows more- id really like to be able to make an actual living rather than getting by XD
06-01-2022T20:41:05,MoonDance,I don't see ko-fi being used as a main-stream think like Patreon so I can see how that one can be a struggle
06-01-2022T20:41:33,MysticWav,Other art is always fun.  Takes a while to find a following though
06-01-2022T20:42:06,SageSaga,especially when ya cant promote it on your main sites XD
06-01-2022T20:42:07,MoonDance,Gotta Advertise yourself out there often
06-01-2022T20:42:43,MoonDance,"oh yeah, I guess that can be an issue. Especially when you're more known NOT making that"

06-01-2022T21:11:31,MysticWav,Just sort of bunkering up here and hoping to ride out the spike
06-01-2022T21:11:37,CrRAR,pretty much
06-01-2022T21:11:58,Bralios,"One coworker had it, entire management maybe also got exposed so... Interesting days at work ahead."
06-01-2022T21:12:00,MysticWav,"not only the cold weather, but all the holiday gathering spread will be kicking in right about then"
06-01-2022T21:12:05,CrRAR,"it's the cost of fully operational schools, as more kids get vaccinated it will get better"
06-01-2022T21:12:13,CrRAR,that too (holiday gatherings)
06-01-2022T21:12:41,CrRAR,hopefully just a quiet hibernation of a wnter will calm it back down
06-01-2022T21:15:02,CrRAR,"had a co-worker scare here, it was a vax'd person unfortunately, still hopefully less virulent that the alternative, everything seems okay otherwise so far :fingers_crossed: "

06-01-2022T22:22:53,SageSaga,the huion had much smaller bevels and wasnt as bad- its too bad it was so expensive and didnt work right
06-01-2022T22:23:06,MatyMaty,I still think you should use one of those desk mini table things

06-01-2022T22:35:08,SageSaga,but its dark
