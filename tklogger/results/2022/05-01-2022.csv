05-01-2022T00:01:30,AspiringNoodle,And they only ask for $40 
05-01-2022T01:49:04,CrRAR,"Kinda Bioshock/Dead Space vibes? Iâ€™ve heard good things, that it was a good standalone game, just that it could have benefitted from bigger ideas and development that a sequel would have."
05-01-2022T02:04:44,CrRAR,"grahhg, also, nap here can confirm was good :thumbsup:"
05-01-2022T02:05:01,CrRAR,though the only thing to do at this hour is more sleeping
05-01-2022T02:05:20,CrRAR,"and rough, that makes a good companion to pretzel Trace!"

05-01-2022T17:13:36,ZapiliDver,1) It must be SFW 2) It must not be an advertisement 3) You must firstly describe it and post after.
