31-12-2021T00:04:25,Roughlandin,Mihari is literally right here lol
31-12-2021T00:04:34,MisterWho,"@LegoP I'd say, they are rare - or they don't like sto stream. ;P"
31-12-2021T00:04:38,BadFoMo,Back-ish; Happy New Year!
31-12-2021T00:04:41,LegoP,but i've noticed there's only two kinds
31-12-2021T00:04:42,Roughlandin,Wb
31-12-2021T00:05:01,LegoP,"Exceedingly polite and shy, or bitter hags"
31-12-2021T00:05:14,Roughlandin,Well uh
31-12-2021T00:05:15,justAblank,there are lots of girl furries just gotta look a little harder
31-12-2021T00:05:22,Roughlandin,That feels like a... generalization
31-12-2021T00:05:35,Dadrobit,Yikes
31-12-2021T00:05:47,Roughlandin,"Big yikes, my dude"
31-12-2021T00:05:57,LegoP,Extremely reductive? yes
31-12-2021T00:06:06,LegoP,"But, that's what i've seen"

31-12-2021T00:06:19,Roughlandin,^^^

31-12-2021T00:07:06,MisterWho,"Some communities can be quite..toxic, sadly"
31-12-2021T00:07:15,Glassan,"Yeh, ladies abound."
31-12-2021T00:07:20,Roughlandin,Furries? Toxic? Nooooooo
31-12-2021T00:07:23,LegoP,"I mean, if they didn't fall into really nice or really mean, I'd say so, but at least that majority are in the very nice category"
31-12-2021T00:07:36,Roughlandin,I think they're mostly just... people
31-12-2021T00:07:39,MisterWho,I said some...not furry ;)

31-12-2021T00:22:53,Dadrobit,English dub
31-12-2021T00:22:56,LegoP,but in 1895
31-12-2021T00:23:25,LegoP,"only one ""automatic"" weapon"
31-12-2021T00:23:34,Dadrobit,Was considering going Japanese with sub next time.
31-12-2021T00:23:48,Glassan,Pretty much.
31-12-2021T00:23:48,Roughlandin,"Same, I tried starting with the Japanese dub but the lip movements didn't match up when I first got it"
31-12-2021T00:23:52,LegoP,the rest are majority single action or worse
31-12-2021T00:24:12,Roughlandin,I think I heard they released an update to match the lips up to the Japanese dub better
31-12-2021T00:24:26,Roughlandin,Weird that the English dub is primary in a Sony game
31-12-2021T00:24:26,Dadrobit,Heard that as well
31-12-2021T00:24:31,Glassan,Hunt is like unfunny dwarf fortress; an exercise in pain.
31-12-2021T00:24:50,Dadrobit,The acting in English was phenomenal though
31-12-2021T00:24:54,Roughlandin,Twas
31-12-2021T00:25:10,MisterWho,dwarf fortress the opposide...ouch!
31-12-2021T00:25:12,LegoP,"Pain, and sadistic pleasure"
31-12-2021T00:25:16,Glassan,^
31-12-2021T00:25:49,LegoP,Set up a tripwire next to this red barrel... 20 minutes later (X)
31-12-2021T00:25:52,ThingsAreMoving,Dwarf fortress with even more pain? Is it even possible?
31-12-2021T00:25:57,LegoP,queue laugh track
31-12-2021T00:26:04,Glassan,:rofl:
31-12-2021T00:26:43,ThingsAreMoving,"I thought DF was he pinnacle of ""F-you / git gud"" gaming"
31-12-2021T00:27:08,Glassan,"Pretty much, at least up until the Souls series."
31-12-2021T00:27:22,GuyOthersome,happy new year from detroit
31-12-2021T00:27:29,LegoP,PvPvE with guns that are slightly better than muskets (in that they're breechloaders) and getting hit by ANY of them could mean death

31-12-2021T00:27:47,ThingsAreMoving,Happy new year from UK! \o/ 
31-12-2021T00:27:51,Glassan,"Hapy new year, Guy"
31-12-2021T00:27:52,BadFoMo,Happy New Year!
31-12-2021T00:28:08,Roughlandin,Didn't DF have a problem with all the cats dying at one point?
31-12-2021T00:28:11,LegoP,What's it like up in the mitten?  state split on the bowl games yet?
31-12-2021T00:28:39,Glassan,"You say yet, like it hasn't already happened..."
31-12-2021T00:28:47,Roughlandin,I remember hearing a story where the cats would walk across the tavern floors and get beer on their paws
31-12-2021T00:28:48,LegoP,(used to live an hour south of detroit)
31-12-2021T00:28:57,Glassan,I'm sure part of the city is already on fire. :P
31-12-2021T00:29:05,LegoP,that's normal
31-12-2021T00:29:16,Glassan,Yup! :V
31-12-2021T00:29:32,Roughlandin,Then they'd lick their paws to clean them and drink the beer. Then they'd die from alcohol poisoning.
31-12-2021T00:29:34,LegoP,it's when the cars start flipping that people start to close the blinds
31-12-2021T00:29:37,CrRAR,clever lil scoundrels
31-12-2021T00:29:39,Roughlandin,Weird stories in bugfixing
31-12-2021T00:29:45,TheSexyBeast,Detroit: on fire since 1967
31-12-2021T00:29:59,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Naokifire:
31-12-2021T00:29:59,Glassan,DF bugs were S-tier Funni
31-12-2021T00:30:07,LegoP,Detroit: No way you're becoming human here
31-12-2021T00:30:16,Glassan,:rofl:
31-12-2021T00:30:29,ThingsAreMoving,Wasn't Detroit like.... the absolute center of automotive industry in the US?
31-12-2021T00:30:36,Roughlandin,Was
31-12-2021T00:30:38,Glassan,Yep.
31-12-2021T00:30:41,KeefMcDerpface,At one point...
31-12-2021T00:30:45,LegoP,Was is the keyword
31-12-2021T00:30:45,Glassan,Hence why it's dying and always on fire.
31-12-2021T00:31:23,Roughlandin,Think I live next to basically the biggest US car factory outside of Telsa now
31-12-2021T00:31:24,LegoP,"Ahhh yes, the ford and chevy plants... where do we make our vehicles? Mexico"
31-12-2021T00:31:27,Dadrobit,Outsourcing overseas and automation killed it largely.
31-12-2021T00:31:44,Glassan,"Of course, any stones thrown from me are definitely shattering my own glass house. :V"
31-12-2021T00:32:06,LegoP,"Chrysler, on the other hand... welp... their quality was never top tier... so maybe still in detroit"
31-12-2021T00:32:16,KeefMcDerpface,hah!
31-12-2021T00:32:20,Roughlandin,The Ford factory in Kentucky is the only one I can think of off the top of my head. Also the Corvette factory
31-12-2021T00:32:32,CrRAR,vroomvroom
31-12-2021T00:32:35,ThingsAreMoving,It's mind boggling that most of the time I see any mention of that place right now is that it's an absolute worst place to live in. How the hell do you turn a city with such a strong industry into... a ghost town?
31-12-2021T00:32:37,LegoP,Not saying we don't make SOME cars here
31-12-2021T00:32:46,TheSexyBeast,"That looks nice, Tom"
31-12-2021T00:33:08,LegoP,"Hell, i believe the biggest factories here are Toyota, i could be wrong though"
31-12-2021T00:33:10,Glassan,"By turning it into a city, then killing it's biggest economy without removing the urbanization."
31-12-2021T00:33:13,ThingsAreMoving,Happy New Year! Tom! :fireworks: :ctwokinds-nibsbounce_xmas:

31-12-2021T00:34:54,Glassan,Pinto was a wonderful mix of design and production flaws.
31-12-2021T00:34:59,ZapiliDver,Good page
