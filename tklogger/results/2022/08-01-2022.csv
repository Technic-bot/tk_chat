08-01-2022T16:17:41,ProsePro7,I stay pretty regular on the week days but I know what you mean when it comes to the weekend all I do is sleep then
08-01-2022T16:18:23,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,I'm doing night shifts right now so I get it
08-01-2022T16:18:25,ThingsAreMoving,Gotta set Alexa with those reminders about keeping sleep schedule more or less tidy.
08-01-2022T16:18:28,Ordithus,Friday nights get me. I should do like Ron and run earlier
08-01-2022T16:18:56,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"If someone here sleep regularly, you have my respect"
08-01-2022T16:19:15,ThingsAreMoving,I do have a steady sleep schedule when I'm working. 
08-01-2022T16:19:35,KaplanSektyPieczarek,@ThingsAreMoving deep bow for you
08-01-2022T16:20:06,ThingsAreMoving,"Bed at 9pm, wake up at 4am, 6-6 work, 6:30pm dinner. Rinse and repeat."
08-01-2022T16:20:09,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,It's soul crushing working night shifts and seeing the sun rise before you can get to sleep
08-01-2022T16:20:21,ThingsAreMoving,"7 days of steady schedule, lol"
08-01-2022T16:20:23,Ordithus,"12 hour shifts, fun"

08-01-2022T16:21:21,ThingsAreMoving,there's 8h of overtime included in those 7 days
08-01-2022T16:21:23,Ordithus,"what type of work do you do, if you don't mind?"
