03-01-2022T14:07:34,CrimsonQuill086,I just watched Ex machina. It's very unsettling...so I'm going to watch Thor Ragnarok to offset it.
03-01-2022T14:42:30,AspiringNoodle,Saw someone mention the coof cases
03-01-2022T14:42:46,AspiringNoodle,Reminder: Case count =/= seriousness of the disease
03-01-2022T14:43:29,AspiringNoodle,"Omicron is highly contagious, but the mildest version of COVID to date (even more mild than the original version, I think)"
03-01-2022T15:03:53,SpaceCadety,"Yeah, but unfortunately, if it conservatively results in 1/3-1/2 of the hospitalization rate of the original, we're still looking at completely overrun hospitals."
03-01-2022T15:05:37,SpaceCadety,Because it's likely going to have peak infection rates 4 times that of last year's peak.
03-01-2022T15:11:45,SpaceCadety,"Of course if most of those cases are in vaccinated people, where hospitalization rates are *much* lower, that changes the numbers a lot."
03-01-2022T15:40:45,AspiringNoodle,You still need to look at the hospitalization / ICU rates of the omicron surges
03-01-2022T15:41:07,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, while cases have spiked to all-time highs, hospitalization counts have barely budged."
03-01-2022T15:41:32,AspiringNoodle,"The US had its first Omicron death on the 24th, I believe?"
03-01-2022T15:41:55,AspiringNoodle,"And I think it had been spreading for weeks at that point.  And the first casualty was the triple whammy of ""vulnerable"""
