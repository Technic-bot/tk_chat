01-01-2022T18:15:15,Sammit,"Hi Keef, Tony and Darth"
01-01-2022T18:15:20,steelabjur,Howdy Dadro!
01-01-2022T18:15:25,Sammit,Hi Failedspells
01-01-2022T18:15:26,DarthKeidran,Greetings!
01-01-2022T18:15:31,TheSexyBeast,👋 Dad
01-01-2022T18:15:41,KaplanSektyPieczarek,sup darthkeidran
01-01-2022T18:15:45,TheSexyBeast,Darth
01-01-2022T18:15:51,KeefMcDerpface,hello Darth
01-01-2022T18:15:59,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Darth
01-01-2022T18:16:01,Twokinds,No
01-01-2022T18:16:03,DarthKeidran,Not much… Other than dealing with a broken Front Right Lower Control Arm for my car
01-01-2022T18:16:20,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh sh*t, what happened?"
01-01-2022T18:16:21,DarthKeidran,Hit the curb at 5MPH and it snapped like a twig
01-01-2022T18:16:26,KeefMcDerpface,wow
01-01-2022T18:16:27,DarthKeidran,I'
01-01-2022T18:16:33,DarthKeidran,Got the dash cam to prove it.
01-01-2022T18:16:37,Twokinds,She's was apprehensive about dating someone so young.
01-01-2022T18:16:52,MaxaroniAndCheez,average u.s. politician
01-01-2022T18:16:54,Mediawatcher37,I remember her mentioning that to rose
01-01-2022T18:17:12,Mediawatcher37,"“He’s too young, even for me”"
01-01-2022T18:17:25,ThingsAreMoving,"Trace wasn't going to become a French president, by any chance?"
01-01-2022T18:17:29,yFamous,Wasn't the situation between Laura and Keith similar?  Keith was 13 and Laura in her 20s when the met?
01-01-2022T18:17:45,Rainelover,"If at least one good thing came from Saria’s death, it was that trace finally stopped being a racist bastard"
01-01-2022T18:17:56,Dadrobit,"No, politicians don't toe lines. They blatantly cross it and then change the location of the line after the fact if someone tries to call them out on it. "
01-01-2022T18:18:00,tony1695,"Keidran aging makes things much harder to make sense of, in regards to Keith and Laura"
01-01-2022T18:18:04,MaxaroniAndCheez,"@yFamous Laura was 16 when she died, and Keith and Laura met 6 years before"
01-01-2022T18:18:09,DarthKeidran,"Saria: He is too young… Yes, Too Young to begin the dating."
01-01-2022T18:18:19,MaxaroniAndCheez,so she was 10 and keith was 13
01-01-2022T18:18:23,Avolendi,I was under the impression that he became that because of her death?
01-01-2022T18:18:31,MaxaroniAndCheez,"still, iirc the keidran age of majority is 8?"
01-01-2022T18:18:37,Avolendi,At least in such extremeness
01-01-2022T18:18:39,yFamous,@MaxaroniAndCheez I mean the keidran equivalent age.
01-01-2022T18:18:47,MaxaroniAndCheez,fair enough
01-01-2022T18:19:05,MaxaroniAndCheez,yeah i'd imagine she'd be somewhere around there
01-01-2022T18:19:28,ThingsAreMoving,"Funny how Trace became ""Keiren"" for some time. Unless Tom is pulling our leg with the 'Keidran hunter"" word."
01-01-2022T18:19:40,Rainelover,"No, he just became a racist bastard who was also genocidal "
01-01-2022T18:19:52,Dadrobit,"Well, more of a racist bastard."
01-01-2022T18:19:59,Dadrobit,He was always a racist bastard
01-01-2022T18:20:03,Twokinds,It doesn't mean Keidran hunter
01-01-2022T18:20:05,MaxaroniAndCheez,"@ThingsAreMoving ""Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!"""
01-01-2022T18:20:06,Twokinds,It just mean hunter
01-01-2022T18:20:11,Twokinds,Like... guys who are named hunter.
01-01-2022T18:20:35,ThingsAreMoving,Ooooooh
01-01-2022T18:20:42,ShamusTheFox,Hunter x Hunter
01-01-2022T18:20:43,ProsePro7,Trace Legacy aka Keidran Slayer
01-01-2022T18:20:45,ThingsAreMoving,that makes more sense
01-01-2022T18:20:46,DarthKeidran,We just need a character named Jäger
01-01-2022T18:20:47,tony1695,"Seems like ""kei"" means some variation of ""beast"" though, given what hunters typically hunt"
01-01-2022T18:20:54,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I mean Trace became racist dictator after magic corruption
01-01-2022T18:20:57,Twokinds,Kei means animal.
01-01-2022T18:21:14,CrimsonQuill086,Lol
01-01-2022T18:21:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but he was always racist, even as a kid. "
01-01-2022T18:21:28,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,so Dran must mean people?
01-01-2022T18:21:31,tony1695,"So, ""dran"" means ""people"" or some such"
01-01-2022T18:21:31,KaplanSektyPieczarek,really?
01-01-2022T18:21:32,Twokinds,Yeah
01-01-2022T18:21:50,Dadrobit,"Referred to Rose as an ""It"" when he was a kid"
01-01-2022T18:21:54,ThingsAreMoving,"I think I've asked this once, but do you have this written down somewhere or are you mostly freestyling with the lore"
01-01-2022T18:22:03,Failedspells101,"To play the devil's advocate in the favor of Trace his pregnant wife was murdered by what he already saw as a lesser being and then he lost his mind trying to bring her back, he could have ended a lot worse i fear."
01-01-2022T18:22:03,ThingsAreMoving,Cause if it's freestyling it's pretty impressive
01-01-2022T18:22:08,ShamusTheFox,Cool. Learned something.
01-01-2022T18:22:10,Dadrobit,And was totally fine with buying a slave later on
01-01-2022T18:22:18,BaskervilleNQH,Lore freestyling gets wild. 
01-01-2022T18:22:19,Mediawatcher37,Saria fought with him over that
01-01-2022T18:22:27,KaplanSektyPieczarek,so he was like Eric
01-01-2022T18:22:31,BaskervilleNQH,I need to start that writers podcast... 
01-01-2022T18:22:51,Dadrobit,"Imagine fighting over the ""right"" to own another person. "
01-01-2022T18:22:55,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"Basker, what podcast?"
01-01-2022T18:23:20,BaskervilleNQH,It's just an idea I've had rolling around my head for a bit. Nothing solid yet. 
01-01-2022T18:23:22,Rainelover,So keidran just means “animal people”?
01-01-2022T18:23:26,Failedspells101,"Yeah, you can't own people, that is just wrong."
01-01-2022T18:23:32,BaskervilleNQH,I need to set some time aside and actually plan it out. 
01-01-2022T18:23:38,Twokinds,"Not an unusual thing for a long time in human history, sadly."
01-01-2022T18:23:52,Glassan,"Not so hard if you are from Napoleanic France or the American Deep South, Dadro. :V"
01-01-2022T18:23:56,Gamerszone,"Good evening, Thomas. Good evening, everyone."
01-01-2022T18:24:01,KaplanSektyPieczarek,They're still slavery
01-01-2022T18:24:08,Glassan,Heyo Gamer

01-01-2022T18:24:27,DarthKeidran,"@ThingsAreMoving I imagine it is, to some extent, freestylbing. If I wrote a comic, unless it was important to the plot, I likely wouldn't think much of a character's age, weight, height, or many other details until this situation (a reference sheet) came"
01-01-2022T18:24:28,Sammit,Hi Shamus

01-01-2022T18:25:07,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Everyone can agree that slavery is bad
01-01-2022T18:25:07,Glassan,"Oh Kap, we haven't used such vulgar words for years... Now we call them 'indentured servants' :V"
01-01-2022T18:25:17,Dadrobit,"Southwest here. Unfortunately still lots of racist bullshit. There's like a dozen confederate monuments here, (Even though the Civil War barely even touched AZ) and a lot of bullshit towards Mexicans"
01-01-2022T18:25:19,Rainelover,I think that’s the first time I have ever seen someone here call him Thomas
01-01-2022T18:25:37,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"but if megacorporations take control, we will have it again"
01-01-2022T18:25:37,Glassan,So formal

01-01-2022T18:31:05,ThingsAreMoving,I believe that you can enjoy everything in moderation.
01-01-2022T18:31:06,BaskervilleNQH,I don't remember the taste of coke. But I do remember its texture. 
01-01-2022T18:31:07,Glassan,"I specifically only drink diet coke/pepsi when I consume soda, because I was so used to mixing it with whiskey that it helped me reduce alcohol consumption by no longer mixing it...."

01-01-2022T18:31:30,BaskervilleNQH,I drink marmite straight from the pot. 
01-01-2022T18:31:36,Glassan,And I often go back to solely water for months at a time.
01-01-2022T18:31:47,tony1695,"Coke was designed at a time when refrigeration was not wide-spread, its flavour profile is intended for drinking warm"

01-01-2022T18:56:28,Roughlandin,Rudy

01-01-2022T18:56:37,DarthKeidran,We did see him right when Group A arrived in Edinmire @Mediawatcher37 
01-01-2022T18:56:47,Glassan,"I hint, yes"
01-01-2022T18:56:49,DarthKeidran,He was kind of hiding in the background though
01-01-2022T18:56:52,Mediawatcher37,Again it’s been a while
01-01-2022T18:56:55,Rainelover,"Im so sad Grand Templar Raine got 7th, but there’s always next time "
01-01-2022T18:57:09,DarthKeidran,in retrospect… Yeah… it's been a couple years
01-01-2022T18:57:09,Roughlandin,"Better luck next time, Raine!"
01-01-2022T18:57:21,DarthKeidran,not counting sketches
01-01-2022T18:57:32,Roughlandin,"Member that time we didn't have a panel with Keith and Nat for a year, lol?"
01-01-2022T18:57:37,Mediawatcher37,He’s only been in one sketch
01-01-2022T18:57:46,DarthKeidran,@Rainelover I've liked that one. There's a ton I've seen regularly that I've been voting for.
01-01-2022T18:57:48,Mediawatcher37,Which time was that?
01-01-2022T18:57:54,DarthKeidran,"Question is, what sketch is this."
01-01-2022T18:57:59,Mediawatcher37,Which chapter?
01-01-2022T18:58:05,Roughlandin,Between Nat leaving Zen's room and arriving at the Oasis Room
01-01-2022T18:58:09,KeefMcDerpface,^
01-01-2022T18:58:13,Mediawatcher37,Oh yeah
01-01-2022T18:58:13,KeefMcDerpface,That time.
01-01-2022T18:58:37,Mediawatcher37,We also nearly went a year without seeing trace or flora
01-01-2022T18:58:43,Roughlandin,Sometime's that's how the comic be
01-01-2022T18:58:56,Brocade,"Male Mike Daki came in 4th, not bad"
01-01-2022T18:59:29,DarthKeidran,"@Mediawatcher37 He's been in one or two of the off-set AU ones, and I want to say another somewhere, but there's no Master Spy tag on http://twokinds.gallery"
01-01-2022T19:00:11,Mediawatcher37,There is a Sirius tag and he only has one sketch
01-01-2022T19:00:14,KeefMcDerpface,Ehem: https://twokinds.gallery/art?tags=Sirius
01-01-2022T19:00:16,Roughlandin,I didn't specify the tropical cocktail in my sketch suggestion but this is EXACTLY the pose I was picturing in my head

01-01-2022T19:00:48,Mediawatcher37,And sirus hasn’t shown up since
01-01-2022T19:00:56,DarthKeidran,I thought his name was Sirus though. Not Sirius
01-01-2022T19:01:02,Roughlandin,Wouldn't be much of a Master Spy if he walked around getting tagged in everything
01-01-2022T19:01:06,Mediawatcher37,Lynn’s been gone for quite a while as well
01-01-2022T19:01:29,DarthKeidran,Yes actually
01-01-2022T19:01:31,Mediawatcher37,Last time he appeared was when he told Keith about the eastern basitin policies.
01-01-2022T19:01:32,Roughlandin,"@DarthKeidran Yes, he's serious. And don't call me Shirley!"
01-01-2022T19:01:37,Rainelover,"I really have been hoping for Grand Templar Raine, girl’s been through so much in her life that I feel she deserves to feel powerful and in control for once "
01-01-2022T19:01:49,Mediawatcher37,Was that snow fight not enough?
01-01-2022T19:02:01,Mediawatcher37,She destroyed a freaking house
01-01-2022T19:02:03,Roughlandin,"Sometime's sketches take a while to go through, Raine. Keep at it"
01-01-2022T19:02:04,MoonDance,He's probably writing up the paperwork for the past three days
01-01-2022T19:02:24,Roughlandin,"Also, you never know what the Tom pick will be, Raine"
01-01-2022T19:02:36,tecbot,@Rainelover  Do not worry will keep suggesting it until either gets picked or i ran out of money for patreon. 
01-01-2022T19:03:05,DarthKeidran,@Mediawatcher37 You've got a good point. My brain hurts. Where is Lynn and why is he not involved in the Mortal Kombat that has been happening around the manor. Wait… Is he outside? Did he run into Sealeen and start a date with her?
01-01-2022T19:03:06,Glassan,I keep feeling like Grand Templar Raine is not as popular since this already exists: https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Arch-Mage-Raine-672960790

01-01-2022T21:21:00,Glassan,Asking the most important question.
01-01-2022T21:21:06,CrRAR,"""Looks like Brahn is BLASTING of AGAINNN"""

01-01-2022T21:23:47,Roughlandin,Congrats Darth!
01-01-2022T21:23:48,Dadrobit,I always wondered what kind of relationship they had. Kinda guessed it was something like she was one of the few adults who accepted him even though he was a disappointment as far as a General's son should be. 
01-01-2022T21:24:07,Dadrobit,"Since she called him ""kiddo"" in the one time she's seen"
01-01-2022T21:24:09,Roughlandin,Vehra's always given me Luna Lovegood vibes
01-01-2022T21:24:14,Roughlandin,Kind of quirky and a loner
01-01-2022T21:24:26,Glassan,But S-tier
01-01-2022T21:24:38,Roughlandin,Luna is also S-tier

01-01-2022T21:25:27,Roughlandin,Cute and terrifying. A heady combination
01-01-2022T21:25:34,Twokinds,"She was like family to Keith, before his banishment. Keith knew she was off the mainland, and thought dead, but he figured finding her was his best bet, if he ended up banished forever."
01-01-2022T21:25:42,Twokinds,So he thought about her often.
