31-12-2019T03:57:52,JojoF2415,I finally beat God Eater easy from geometry dash. My worst fail was 93% and 97%. I was so mad to the point it drove me insane and nearly cried
31-12-2019T03:58:19,JojoF2415,I beat it 9 minutes before 2020

31-12-2019T12:20:43,AspiringNoodle,No-hit SL1 run in DS1
31-12-2019T12:20:52,AspiringNoodle,"All bosses, even optional / dlc ones :P"
31-12-2019T12:21:11,JojoF2415,?
31-12-2019T12:21:37,AspiringNoodle,Look it up ;)
31-12-2019T12:22:42,JojoF2415,I don‚Äôt play that game
31-12-2019T12:24:20,AspiringNoodle,Well then
31-12-2019T12:24:30,AspiringNoodle,I shall find something to make you wish it was God Eater on easy xD
31-12-2019T12:24:57,JojoF2415,That was the name of a level in Geometry Dash
31-12-2019T12:25:50,AspiringNoodle,"I know, I'm trying to find something equally frustrating in a different game"
31-12-2019T12:25:56,JojoF2415,"About 7 months with 11,521 attempts. Those fails hurt me so hard"
31-12-2019T12:26:17,AspiringNoodle,"The first thing I mentioned, 100% Expert Through the Fire and Flames, Doom (2016) Ultra-Nightmare"
31-12-2019T12:26:51,JojoF2415,I play Pok√©mon and Minecraft as well
31-12-2019T12:27:53,JojoF2415,Geometry dash is super frustrating and gets me nervous
31-12-2019T12:28:11,AspiringNoodle,Beat pokemon only with a first stage bug pokemon :P
31-12-2019T12:28:36,AspiringNoodle,"You could use a level 100 Caterpie and it would count, lol"
31-12-2019T12:28:39,JojoF2415,I heated Pok√©mon in 1 minute
31-12-2019T12:28:45,JojoF2415,Beated
31-12-2019T12:30:53,JojoF2415,Seems like someone hated the fact that I beated god eater easy before new years
31-12-2019T12:31:51,JojoF2415,Which I don‚Äôt under stand because my profile comment about that level has 2 likes

31-12-2019T16:56:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I asked why dynamite too
31-12-2019T16:57:09,SpazztasticKiwi,my sister muttered ‚Äúrednecks‚Äù
31-12-2019T16:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,and you know what
31-12-2019T16:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs right
31-12-2019T17:01:38,TeapotOfDoom,lol
31-12-2019T17:06:55,CrRAR,That and the great big earth-shattering kaboom.
31-12-2019T17:07:32,CrRAR,Rednecks in cahoots with the aliens obvs.
31-12-2019T17:11:01,Dadrobit,Happy new year y'all!
31-12-2019T17:21:16,JojoF2415,Happy new year
31-12-2019T17:23:56,CrRAR,Happy new year~
31-12-2019T17:25:24,Dadrobit,Any good resolutions?
31-12-2019T17:26:16,Dadrobit,Zero soda and keep sugary drinks to an absolute minimum if any at all all year.
31-12-2019T17:26:36,Dadrobit,Found I was imbibing in them a bit much in the last few months.
31-12-2019T17:26:42,Dadrobit,Gotta cut that shit out.
31-12-2019T17:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,aunt and uncle did that one year
31-12-2019T17:30:05,SpazztasticKiwi,he lost ~50 pounds
31-12-2019T17:31:13,Dadrobit,"For real, sugar is the devil"
31-12-2019T17:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,they also started drinking nothing but water
31-12-2019T17:33:12,Dadrobit,"Ever since about Halloween - Thanksgiving, my residents have been showering me and my fellow guards with sodas and chocolate, I've gained like 7-8 pounds. No bueno."
31-12-2019T17:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs still got problems though
31-12-2019T17:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,had a heart attack a bit ago
31-12-2019T17:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,despite the weight loss and watching his diet now
31-12-2019T17:34:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I feel that. Heath problems are slow to happen, then they suck like hell and are slow to resolve."
31-12-2019T17:35:07,Dadrobit,Couple two or three years ago I found out I have a bad case of NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease)
31-12-2019T17:36:06,Dadrobit,"Turns out, even though I'm active and don't really drink all that often, just because I've eaten like shit for most of my life, the crap my liver's had to clean has screwed it over as if I were a deep alcoholic."
31-12-2019T17:36:31,Dadrobit,All those 20 cent burritos and dollar menu chicken sandwiches man.
31-12-2019T17:36:55,SpazztasticKiwi,my dad had issues and medicine and then a surgery that made it impossible to throw up
31-12-2019T17:36:55,TeapotOfDoom,damn
31-12-2019T17:37:05,SpazztasticKiwi,and was not to drink
31-12-2019T17:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,guess what he did anyway
31-12-2019T17:37:24,TeapotOfDoom,damn
31-12-2019T17:37:26,Dadrobit,Doc says most folks in America have it and don't even know because we consume so much craptastic fast food.
31-12-2019T17:37:54,Dadrobit,Drink?
31-12-2019T17:37:56,TeapotOfDoom,well good thing i' a responsible adult who eats way to many choclates
31-12-2019T17:38:22,TeapotOfDoom,should really cut down on that. sounds like a good resolution
31-12-2019T17:38:24,SpazztasticKiwi,liquor
31-12-2019T17:38:43,SpazztasticKiwi,still had a good stock in the cabinet when he died
31-12-2019T17:39:15,TeapotOfDoom,shit
31-12-2019T17:40:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I don't do giant lifestyle change resolutions. Too unreliable. But just cutting one or two things out like soda and sugared coffee? Easy. just don't buy it."
31-12-2019T17:41:57,Dadrobit,Maybe I can finally break that 179 mark \o/
31-12-2019T17:43:32,Dadrobit,Currently 195. Feels bad approaching 200 again.
31-12-2019T17:44:14,TeapotOfDoom,uhhh
31-12-2019T17:44:58,TeapotOfDoom,so about 90kg
31-12-2019T17:45:24,TeapotOfDoom,sry had to convert
31-12-2019T17:45:37,Dadrobit,"NP, I get it"
31-12-2019T17:45:58,SpazztasticKiwi,oh boi 179 kg
31-12-2019T17:46:05,Dadrobit,Oof
31-12-2019T17:46:07,SpazztasticKiwi,lord he commin
31-12-2019T17:46:48,SpazztasticKiwi,you know there was a man about 400+ lbs that I saw featured once
31-12-2019T17:47:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"he was so depressed cause of how he looked and believed he was going to die early, there was nothing he could do, and he‚Äôd just lost his dad"
31-12-2019T17:47:38,SpazztasticKiwi,didn‚Äôt believe his fianc√©e could love him
31-12-2019T17:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,and then he saw a ‚Äú20 pounds in a month‚Äù sort of ad for a gym and decided ‚Äúyou know what‚Äù
31-12-2019T17:49:19,SpazztasticKiwi,lost ~200 lbs & I don‚Äôt know the guy but I. am. proud.
31-12-2019T17:51:17,Dadrobit,Biggest I ever got was 235. Dude lost as much weight as I was ever as a big person.
31-12-2019T17:51:35,TeapotOfDoom,wow losing that much is not bad
31-12-2019T17:53:43,SpazztasticKiwi,then he got the skin cut off
31-12-2019T17:56:10,TeapotOfDoom,yeah prolly nessecary after losing that much. but it really transforms people
31-12-2019T17:57:41,TeapotOfDoom,a popular physicist over here lost a lot of weight after a hard attack. was about 150kg before and went down to about 90kg as well i think. he looks completely different now
31-12-2019T17:58:01,SpazztasticKiwi,the stretch marks & skin I got from my weight is something I want work done on
31-12-2019T17:58:29,Dadrobit,"Man, even dropping 40 pounds felt amazing when I first decided to stop getting fatter."
31-12-2019T17:58:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I gained alot in a small span in hs then after graduation ended up loosing it and man I‚Äôll tell you I realize now I looked awful
31-12-2019T17:58:55,Dadrobit,Literally could not imagine living with just an extra person attatched to myself.
31-12-2019T17:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,dropped close to 40 pounds myself
31-12-2019T17:59:55,Dadrobit,For a bunch of years after I broke my back I just got progressively more lazy. Was an easy slow decent into fatface.
31-12-2019T18:00:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"still got more to loose, gained some in winter"
31-12-2019T18:00:01,Dadrobit,descent*
31-12-2019T18:07:31,TeapotOfDoom,you broke your back?
31-12-2019T18:08:53,Dadrobit,Yeah lol. In six places.
31-12-2019T18:09:21,Dadrobit,Dirtbike accident.
31-12-2019T18:10:06,TeapotOfDoom,wow shit
31-12-2019T18:10:15,Dadrobit,Easy to put off working out when it hurts just that little bit extra.
31-12-2019T18:10:32,TeapotOfDoom,yup classic
31-12-2019T18:11:58,TeapotOfDoom,i'm so glad i started to boulder regularly about a year ago. kept me quite fit. need to stop eating as much choclates tho
31-12-2019T18:14:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I haul around so many boxes my arms are skinny but they‚Äôre lean
31-12-2019T18:15:44,Dadrobit,"Home gym stuff is my jam. Stationary bike and a weight machine. One hour, every M/W/F. Scheduling is actually the best."
31-12-2019T18:15:55,TeapotOfDoom,indeed
31-12-2019T18:16:31,TeapotOfDoom,my schedule is going for a set of exercises every day. doesn't need to be as much as long as it's consistent
31-12-2019T18:16:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"when I was running and tried that 50 squats a night for a month, I could crush a watermelon with my legs"
31-12-2019T18:17:07,Dadrobit,"Not buff, and definitely less definition than I had a few months ago, but that consistent schedule at least keeps me in a shape that isn't ""round"""
31-12-2019T18:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,the idea was to decrease their size tho
31-12-2019T18:17:17,SpazztasticKiwi,so I cut the squats
31-12-2019T18:23:33,RimaDraws,yo again
31-12-2019T18:24:01,TeapotOfDoom,yo rima
